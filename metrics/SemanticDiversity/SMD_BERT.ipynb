    "\n",
    "According to recent studies (Tevet and Berant, 2021; Stasaski and Hearst, 2022), just lexical-level evaluation metrics often fail to capture semantic diversity, since texts including similar words can have different semantics and texts with different words can have similar semantics (Yarats and Lewis, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "We tackle this problem by transforming sentences into semantically meaningful sentence embeddings using Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "We quantify semantic diversity as the dispersion of sentence embeddings over the semantic space. The dispersion is measured by either the average pairwise cosine-distance of all embedding vectors (D_sem_p) or the mean cosine distance of each embedding vector to the centroid\n",
