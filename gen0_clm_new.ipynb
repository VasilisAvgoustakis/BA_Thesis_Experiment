But if only someone had been able to make sense of all those things without being too careful about telling us anything at the beginning... then why shouldn't our ancestors be allowed into this place? Why does everything start with something bad happening outside of our own home every day since everyone else can do nothing except stare up from their grave for some reason other than because he knows better - which means even more importantly right now your family still ca n ’ t stop looking back while reading books until one night when suddenly somebody comes running around saying `` This guy was trying to get away '' ( sorry ) ; etc. What happened after these events did no longer matter anymore anyway : instead of walking towards the living room door open, following behind him were men dressed in black suits holding large guns pointing at each other just above the door frame. No man appeared before his head ever looked either way again -- perhaps by mistake, maybe simply due to circumstances rather quickly enough i assumed neither side wanted to hear any further comments nor thought much beyond their heads. Perhaps most likely based off of the fact that nobody really knew exactly whether or NOT THE MAN IN BLACK WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME AND EVEN IF THEY DID N'T KNOW HOW HE HAD ACCEPTED THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE ABLE FOR ANYTHING BUT THEIR LIVES – NO ONE ELSE THAN YOU ARE ALONE OF THEM AS WE ALL DO EVERY DAY LONG AFTER THIS ATTACKED BY HIM IS CANDIDATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LEAVE MIND LIKE ME SO MUCH WITHOUT AN EXPERIENCE OR TORTURE BEFORE THERE HAS EVER BEEN MORE GIVING STUPID PLACES ABOUT WHAT JERUS CHRIST REALLY WANTS NEXT TIME SHE SWEAR HER ON EARTH NOW AGAIN.

The only thing keeping him alive for years after our deaths was his love interest- they wanted to kill himself by killing everyone around him so that nobody would notice until soon afterwards where all those other people died from being infected into another dimension instead.

But remember right away about 10 minutes ago my friend James came up with the idea behind this whole situation having gone horribly wrong last week over the course months between the two ships sending messages warning the entire universe to leave Earth alone whenever possible causing global catastrophe including nuclear accidents etc. He did say goodbye shortly afterward however apparently caused both of them to start running faster rather than slower anyway – things were getting worse each time she got closer and nearer together becoming ever harder and farther apart eventually finding her own place entirely outside of the stars themselves despite taking precautions necessary to keep herself safe whilst traveling along the same route constantly ignoring warnings throughout the galaxy such as following orders given to anyone nearby near them immediately within 1 minute radius should probably go down quickly already anyways considering its almost always late otherwise making sure the emergency evacuation system will still work properly leaving very little chance of survival through the rest of the day unless needed lest somewhere unforeseen occur first contact might take precedence amongst whatever reason society decided to evacuate altogether regardless of whether or not to risk losing hope… well thats exactly whats happening today sir..

He slowly looked back towards me still staring at his wife standing behind him crying silently whilst simultaneously laughing hysterically under the covers. The door closed shut quickly closing shortly afterwards although no one found their way inside except for the man sitting nearby whose head was buried deep below his chest cavity. The police officer opened the front doors quietly removing the man immediately following them exiting the room once more telling everyone exactly whom he saw leading to the house being searched further away rather than getting caught off guard either. As soon as he came close enough the man began to shout obscenities onto the carpet surrounding his body only to realise its owner lay dead within seconds.

      "I have always been fascinated by these things. I was first to discover them when they were young, but it had turned out that their parents used to be very good at hiding behind trees or being able to get away from people and not find anything wrong about them.   Then we discovered that humans are like other animals living on land around the world which means no matter how hard you try to hide your face for fear of what might happen if something happens before everything else is possible! They're kind of like wolves because every time someone tries to take down a tree without knowing who has done so since then there goes to be another one after all until eventually everyone knows exactly where those two groups live ; sometimes even some of them just disappear into the forest as soon as any trace of them disappears... Sometimes however, this makes me wonder why my friends never found themselves here anyway ( oh well ) while hunting deer only works during nighttime : It would also make me think maybe an extra person will notice us sooner than later whenever our family comes along again? So let me tell you - `` There can be nothing really different between us '' etc. Anyway, despite my excitement over finding out more of these kinds of things through sheer luck, I decided to follow up on this theory based off of reading books written under similar circumstances throughout my life trying new methods of searching old texts online.. But alas, due to the amount of information available already though, none of my students seem to know each other anymore anyways. The fact is, i don't remember much now except for the fact that most of my classmates still keep forgetting details such as names/dates, dates/times/a lot of stuff regarding human behavior via google searches… And yet apparently nobody seems to care enough to help pass judgment day-today too many times saying *what* did anyone say today right next to me rather than go crazy thinking “ Well wait dude come back tomorrow morning heheh manoweeeepyyyhhhhhhhhhoooohahaha habahahhaaaaah yeah haha thank god please don ’ t worry buddy hey lookin ” cause im pretty sure his mom does enjoy having fun talking to him everyday she says **her* name instead of her mother** OH GOD WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EVEN WANT TO KNOW THIS IS A CIRC\n",

No one knew why it happened anymore and nobody has ever said anything about me before or after my disappearance... except for those who were there to talk to when they heard of this strange woman that had come out from the shadows - not even if you wouldn't believe what i told them!   She just looked like me ; beautiful blonde hair, full of life-size glasses and blue eyes, wearing a white sweater at all times. Her pale skin was perfect as if she could have lived forever without any form of clothing whatsoever. It made everything feel different now : dark brown eyes, bright red lips, and pink teeth. The way her face seemed to glow around me reflected off of her body into a soft yellowish light which only intensified over time until it began to fade away completely leaving nothing behind.   But then again, did everyone think we were weird? Well, maybe because our memories are so vivid sometimes someone must be looking directly through us everyday trying desperately to convince myself otherwise. Or perhaps some people might simply act strangely though their bodies do n ’ t matter anyway -- something is wrong…or worse than normal right here either. Whatever happens next will happen eventually – no sooner can anyone really tell where these things are going *right*..I mean sure most of the world thinks humans live alone together somewhere else ( see below ).

      "The sun shone brightly over the horizon. It was dusk, and it had been sunny since he entered his house back home ten years ago. A breeze brushed through the trees behind him, blowing away clouds that hung on the ground like a gust of wind. He looked up at the sky above.   The boy stood there with a smile as he readied his coat pocket for his wallet. His father held out his hand tightly ; he never gave an answer when they were young. `` You know this isn't what you wanted me to do... ''   The boy stared down at the paper trail where he 'd found them all -- his mother who always wore a red dress shirt but just kept her company while she waited patiently inside the apartment complex until their child finally came from school or college. He took one last look around before closing his eyes again.   He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled off his own sweatshirt which sat folded neatly under the blanket beside his bed. After taking another few steps forward, he walked towards the door frame open.   Inside, the boy stepped outside looking at the wall surrounding the doorframe. Looking straight ahead, he saw the only light source within the room : the television screen. From there, the TV turned on slowly so he could see nothing more than the sound of the TV playing. Suddenly, something struck him! What? This man ran toward the camera immediately after being hit by a car speeding along the road leading to the front door. Before him, the lights flashed once brighter then ever seen before. Then, suddenly, everything disappeared except the sound of the TV getting louder every second longer. But now, no matter how loud the noise, everything seemed to turn black faster each time. At first, the light started to dimmer even further - eventually, the walls began to fall apart completely. When he got closer, the lights stopped moving properly enough that he felt dizzy. As soon as the light went out, the man noticed something unusual about the TV. There was a sharp crackle coming from the ceiling fan connected directly to the wall separating the TV from the living room. All the lights stayed still though, leaving nothing visible between the ceiling fan and the living room floor. Finally, he heard a bang. And then, someone rushed downstairs screaming wildly against the wall nearby.\n",

It would just make sense if everyone knew who was behind those dark schemes but they had no idea how long ago she had been there with him. She always seemed so calm at times like this. But then something happened here : The one thing which made things even more complicated than before -- -the two were not supposed ta meet each other anymore or fight over their destiny together ; instead, both were trying desperately to find someone else to stop them. And neither are any of them truly capable of stopping evil though. So why does she think about fighting back when he saw her come out into the open without first thinking through anything wrong ( maybe because she thought being a sorceress meant death )? What kind of person wants to get rid of such people while still having control over society until every single day after another party decides to join forces against itself completely ruining everything around them by leaving these groups off balance once per year..

It looks quite interesting though as well - why would they just leave me alone when all I see anyway? Besides, nobody has ever gone through what might have happened if my magical lamp hadn't been lit by torches or torches instead of swords which were made of glass from stone ; who knows how long since anyone *ever* was going insane trying its magic again because no one bothered taking care of anything other than the firewood around them anymore. So far nothing changes but the firewood now falls off every tree trunk except for a few dozen trees below. They seem to have gotten bored watching TV over and over without any idea where to go next either way : )   This whole thing started about 3 years ago while someone didn't think much of it yet ( especially given the fact that only five people went near the city center each year during the first two weeks ). After several months of searching online forums dedicated solely to finding the best spells available, an endless supply of search engines came up asking questions regarding the power of the lamp itself. Most of these queries focused purely upon specific spell names rather then simply those listed above. Once everything clicked together, the wizard noticed something strange moving down towards the ground nearby. As soon as the light faded away, the wizard took another look inside. A small hole formed within the hole forming between the trees surrounding it. Within minutes, the entire forest became clear. There was a huge room filled with candles surrounded by candles illuminated by the flames. Suddenly, the wizard looked directly at the flames, looking closer. Slowly, the flames began burning brightly behind them. Eventually, the flames died completely instantly due to the magical lamp being extinguished entirely right under the lamp. Only darkness remained however. Everyone knew exactly whom the lamp was standing facing ahead of them.

''   `` I do remember being able to see you with my own eyes when I came out of school and went into the bathroom... that feeling is something so terrible about me..but now what? What if someone were reading this journal again at night or thinking all along how bad things could be happening on their lives like this one morning while they walked up to me by myself without looking back from the window as well? And then there was nothing but an itch inside me too ; maybe some kind of itching had started somewhere around here…It felt good after hearing those words before -I suppose we can both say goodbye together once more though….you know why-it feels great knowing who will never forget us forever ”   The doctor smiled weakly upon his new discovery :   `` Well uh, um, yes, not very often actually—well, really quite simply*ever*ever*ever*ever*ever*ever. That means most people have experienced happiness through these experiences over the years anyway because even still many others feel sadness sometimes enough to make them happy somehow ( such as seeing yourself alone ) since childhood has been blissful rather than misery itself. So yeah, perhaps loneliness did cause depression during adolescence –the reason everyone else does is due largely via sheer luck which makes sense considering *this* case indeed. But guesswork might also help explain other feelings besides pain …and surely she would ever think of having her heart beat faster/faster everytime she got closer to home haha.

He turned around slowly towards the door frame which opened into a small room : a large desk sat in front of him, sitting across from him. His face was covered only in a sheet of paper written in black ink. A picture of himself smiling proudly appeared next to his clipboard showing his nameplate.   “ Hello Mr. Jones, my name is James Bond. Do you want to speak to me today sir? ”   “ Of course yes, please answer whatever question may come forth first though most likely through any means necessary being asked here within 5 minutes….and unfortunately none of us are allowed to leave until tomorrow morning…..as per usual will be provided upon arrival unless requested otherwise……no thank you very much Mark.

Please just take these words out from my mouth so that everyone knows everything on their own terms ; tell yourself something good at life while telling others nothing else-I mean really no one can hear all of this shit unless someone tells ya otherwise. We both need to stop fighting each other right away with our lives together here instead of talking nonsense like this again when things go wrong by ourselves though. Let's see : A young woman comes into town asking her father questions over whether he wants to die today ( which makes sense ) then walks off saying his name after several hours explaining some new information back up under the same sheet of paper stating that even more important matters such has been lost between him and the man named Mina. She doesn't want to kill himself tonight since Mom said goodbye last night anyway *just give it another chance* until mom asks herself “ Will I talk to you tomorrow morning please? Or maybe come home early next week.. Well lets get started… Maybe find out soon enough** What happened yesterday evening Mr.Mina told her mother didn´t think anyone wanted to fight anymore either way…..But still….she loved being alone around adults—and having kids anyways helped keep her going through school every day ever since kindergarten had been hardworking everyday despite her mother demanding answers whenever she needed help getting older …Well apparently nobody knew exactly HOW much money Ms.Mina gave her dad sent towards helping pay for college tuition–but honestly neither person believed her daughter existed anywhere besides the house itself. And yet none of those two seemed to care very little whatsoever except for Mrs.Mina. So far most of the children seem to simply look down on themselves sometimes giving advice along the way –although few appear to remember hearing voices speaking directly behind their ears during recesses nor trying communicate clearly using language spoken outside of their mouths/clothes etc. As well as Dr.S\n",

It is only now that we shall meet once more in our journey home... or so it seemed like long ago after all these years of strife between us for what seems to be a great victory over the people of this realm? We will see who wins next time around but before then there would be no need for such an event ; instead we were bound by our own destiny - if only they could unite themselves against each other than ours together until one day when their fate was decided upon them both. So don't worry about any of this nonsense though : while many may disagree with me concerning the decision of whether or how to proceed without further ado, let alone fight amongst yourselves today-and-you can always find some kind of agreement among yourselves regarding where to start off ahead of time depending on which direction you choose based on its merits.. But none of that matters anymore because most of those things must already be taken care of within two weeks due to the sudden influx of tourists arriving every year across the globe during the first half of 2017. And unfortunately however, even through these events nobody knows exactly why anyone should take action unless given enough warning beforehand ( especially considering everyone else ) except for the fact that just yesterday someone accidentally killed himself twice outside a window overlooking London had suddenly appeared out of nowhere along with a note written down saying that she wanted to stop playing video games right away…but apparently somebody has somehow managed to pull herself into a situation worse suited to being caught up in real life – either way, nothing happened last night actually *so far* anyway.

It is now on its way home from war, but it has been destroyed by an unknown force that will not allow us to return here or any other place at all -- unless we are given permission to board...   As I boarded my vessel's hull came into view ; as soon as I stepped onto the surface, I could feel the gravity pull me out of my seat again. My eyes widened when I saw the ship approaching.   `` Hello? '' I asked confusedly.  The voice spoke through a speaker attached to my helmet.  `` What do you want?

Well, maybe he knows better than me though… well let me guess there might be one thing more important besides being alive after everything went wrong once everyone died off entirely. That *thing* really did make sense anyway – since no matter who dies before then, our last hope rests in the survival of humanity itself. We had already found enough food ( apparently ) to sustain humans long enough to survive without dying completely alone until their own death due to sheer luck combined with our technological advances over many millennia ago. So far, nothing happened yet either. But hey, why ca n´t anyone see another human body going extinct anyways? Because these things have become extremely rarer nowadays thanks to technology developed during WWII. Maybe someday Humanity should finally find someone capable of surviving beyond mere days old instead of years old altogether? If mankind still exists today, imagine having them around ourselves somewhere longer while using advanced technologies meant to support life further away down below Earth somehow. Or perhaps eventually.. At least hopefully nobody wants to die outside of their comfort zone forever.

It could only be an old man like yourself ; someone new born years ago wearing nothing different than his mask now.. But no-one knows how long until most of the world knew exactly which person hid underneath my mask had died last year on Earth ( i.e. since 2014 ). As soon as the dust settled down onto the ground below, I began to realize something peculiar happened at once during the day while driving past buildings around the cityscape. A loud bang filled the air outside of the building itself causing a large cloud of dust to roll into the sky surrounding the building. My vision quickly became clearer due to my surroundings being covered in dust particles everywhere except for a few houses above. However, each house seemed to be completely devoid of any debris whatsoever save for the small blue dot visible in the sky leading to a rather large room full off the street corner across from me. There was a huge pile of rubble scattered throughout the entire area along with several other bodies lying dead beside the rubble strewn around the building. People rushed through the rubble trying desperately to escape some of the debris however. Eventually, everything collapsed under the pressure of the wind blowing slowly away leaving barely noticeable marks on the ground beyond. All of the buildings within a mile of the building looked equally lifeless as the dust clouds passed overhead right beneath the building. I realized immediately afterwards that nobody really cared enough to notice though -- none of the residents either noticed nor bothered to look back ahead anyway.

There has been no one over there ever seems to want to see his children leave after all these years living together just under two feet tall enough to hide beneath their own blanket covered in dirt instead of water. It would take several more generations before people realized exactly why anyone could actually care less than themselves ( especially since everyone seemed to have forgotten ) ; They had taken advantage of the opportunity to escape into space where nobody knew existed outside of their homes until today. But those times did n´t last long either. Until recently humans tried to protect each other against predators such things as insects and bees. As time went on however, humanity started to realize its limits : Humans needed food quickly too. So many species lost hope during the war which left only survivors unable to reach an adequate amount of food through starvation due to lack of supplies within days. Even though human societies eventually decided to sacrifice resources elsewhere to feed on the dwindling population of humans, once mankind found another way to sustain itself despite the fact that Earth gave birth to billions of new civilizations upon thousands of years of history.

      "``... I think he's dead. ''   He wasn't going anywhere with me, but the light of his eyes could tell us all about him ; it had taken several days for this to be real. We were alone in the woods and out of sight like that. The sun shone brightly through the trees as we watched our little boy drift away from the fire below.  `` What is wrong with you?! ''   `` It's not right now. You just can't see anything anymore so why are you doing such an awful thing at home here - how do you even know what your son has been thinking lately? Look up my daughter again if you can understand these things yourself. She knows exactly who she wants me to be, because sometimes something bad happens when someone tries to stop them trying to help those people around them. But there have been times where they wo N'T feel safe without being hurt or abused themselves too much -- which brings us back to another day today though. Not every time one of us ever finds himself hurting somebody else more than others ( except maybe Mom ), however, some of us will wake up screaming over their loss after losing control of the world above them, whether God does or doesn ’ t believe everything told us otherwise. This morning came early enough to bring news reports across the country telling everyone involved in the case of the mysterious disappearance of my daughter. Nowhere near as many as 3-4 people reported seeing each other while looking down upon the wreckage of their houses before heading off into the night sky toward the city center downtown. Many wondered aloud : Was anyone behind the house supposed to care less then any child would want? No wonder no one noticed until police arrived outside asking questions later. All sorts of crazy theories ran rampant throughout the town surrounding the disappearance. If only mom did n´t hear rumors once per week anyway. Maybe parents never knew better, since nobody cared anyways either. Well, perhaps none of that matters really yet considering Dad didníve seen *any* family members disappear overnight tonight unless he saw pictures of his son standing next to his mother lying beside him holding a small bag full of candy bars stacked neatly between his shoulders. That sounds good cause apparently dad got caught stealing money first instead of selling drugs together afterwards due to circumstances unrelated to the disappearance of his\n",

      "The year was 2050. A single cell phone had been installed, and it couldn't have predicted that people would die in this manner by now or even after twenty years. Every one of them seemed to be dead at their last breath before they were gone entirely, but only when there was no need for communication on Earth from other places beyond earth like Mars.   The days went down with the number of deaths rising exponentially as more lives started being saved up every day until something changed : a person's body turned into a human skeleton which became an organic mass within minutes. This made sense - what we thought happened next? It did n´t matter ; everyone died just because they lived alone anymore. Everyone looked back upon each other and hoped for some kind answer – nobody knew who survived all these centuries without anyone knowing about how much longer our future depended on us getting out of here somewhere else. Nobody believed anything so far though - if any of us ever got anywhere near enough time ( since then ) someone found another way forward somehow going through life... And yet nothing came between me and my deathbed! So I decided to set off myself towards the nearest town once again -- *I* planned on heading north/south-eastwards right away, not really sure why I needed to go around trying things outside of the city limits instead of looking directly at the sun while wandering along the coastlines leading to the mountains above. Then I headed south…and waited patiently waiting impatiently hoping that whoever tried to kill me still existed anyway anyways. As soon as I reached the horizon, I noticed that none of my friends saw me coming closer than three miles past. They both immediately called 911—no one answered either. No one spoke English except for me, apparently. After several hours of searching, I finally arrived home.   `` Hello? '' I asked quietly over the radio. `` Are you alright? '' He said softly, and gave me a reassuring smile. `` Good morning sir. You know your wife has never told you she should talk to you lately. We are worried too little sometimes nowadays however. She will come visit her family tomorrow afternoon please. Do you want to help get rid of her? '' He paused his silence momentarily briefly whilst he talked slowly inside of himself. `` Yes dear sweetheart. Please do not hesitate\n",

We can never even get there before we have too many more hours left until all those planets will fall apart and everything else becomes chaos again if no other intelligent species ever came along with us like ours do now. If only some alien civilization were capable enough to survive long enough to try and find another habitable planet out there would be so much trouble as it does make life impossible any less easy than normal -- unless such a disaster happens right next to us anyway. In fact, while most people think aliens just need help from outside sources ; something about my time has changed since then-I am back where I started : There must be someone somewhere nearby - maybe somebody special being able to travel far away by way over our solar system ( *maybe* anyone ) but without him having to go through countless tests beforehand because he already knows exactly how to move fast – well let me tell you though : This guy looked pretty old after all these years. But his family had been kind enough to visit once every four years when he arrived.. He went down into the deep recesses of the universe knowing nothing new going forward except for the fact that nobody really knew which side he was on either side. And yet none of us seemed to care anymore besides ourselves telling each others stories regarding everyone whose existence did not end up finding themselves trapped within a massive void filled with thousands upon thousands of universes inside of them. So very few seem to understand its meaning completely…except for myself. Nowhere near as big as my own birthday party tonight seems to have ended properly due to the fact that both the human and the alien race decided to give each other two chances rather than face off against each other instead of facing off against eachother forever longer ago.

Secondly, nations must decrease resources drastically since many diseases naturally occurring within developed regions lead to larger amounts of blood loss among themselves during disease outbreaks led directly to higher overall productivity increases compared largely to non-human societies leading to greater animal welfare benefits combined with high quality agricultural products across the globe [ http: //en.wikipedia._org/wiki_of_humanity_the_worse/. ] Therefore, between states achieving minimum wage jobs via healthcare provided services required for citizens living in developing areas further reduces total GDP\n",

But then something happened suddenly around 3:30am Pacific Standard Time ( UTC ). All communication between Earth and the Federation fleet came through static lines which caused alarms throughout the system except for the communications channel where each message went unanswered. After 5 seconds silence finally settled upon the captain looking into the communications channels instead of directly observing an emergency situation unfolding outside the intercom network.

As soon as I open my eyes another memory pops forth which reminds me of yesterday…yesterday..it happened too fast ago…..I could see three different faces lying around waiting for me outside….my mother looked down upon me laughing hysterically whilst standing beside me smiling sadly knowing exactly whats happening haha…no need to worry mom said yes daddy saw pictures coming across facebook showing photos etc dad felt guilty since its cute really hard to find friends anyways maybe thats fine Mom asked okay ok alright please go home mum hugged Daddy saying goodbye Dad came running towards me crying softly holding hands pulling me close huging me closer finally feeling better than ever last night father kissed me sadly giving me a warm smile seeing as I fell asleep peacefully sobbing quietly telling me sorry Mum told me goodnight always stay safe forever remember wishing mummy loved mine very badly tonight dear miss your mum mama never stayed quiet sweetie let me hold onto tight hugs letting me pull tightly hugging my sister kissing me gently comforting me loving me being happy Mother whispering whispered tears deep inside me waking early morning getting dressed wearing red pants slippers sleeping off bed reading books taking notes\n",

      "I am the only one alive. I was born to live with my family, and at 17 years old, I had been forced into an orphanage for reasons unknown to me. My parents were there because they wanted me to go back home after all. As soon as I left school, I found out where their daughter came from.   I grew up in a small town called San Juan City when I went outside to see if it would be safe or not. The first time I saw her... she looked so young! She seemed like she hadn't aged any longer than three months since we moved here together. It felt nice seeing someone who really cared about us both now. I never knew how long ago this happened but even though I did remember what exactly transpired then I just kept looking forward to sharing stories of amazing things happening around the world through video games on various televisions everywhere. People talking about being able to die without having to watch people drown themselves under water while watching others sleep peacefully during the night? And why do you think everyone is dead anyway? There are no movies anymore ; instead, each movie has become more complex - much darker by the minute until our last glimpse of reality begins. We have lived hundreds of years apart yet still feel loved again : the same way every other person can always love another human child does today. This year alone will forever change everything – something new should happen within 24 hours either. Even before tonight comes tomorrow morning ( March 4th ) these events seem normal enough once we realize that some days life changes drastically depending on which day he lives. At least those nights look different compared to yesterday's ones too. How many times ca n ’ t your friends know anything else besides *my* best friend…isn´t possible right now? But..we need to talk over them later-today ''. He laughs maniacally `` What good news await you guys eh? You said goodbye earlier huh? Oh yeah hey buddy kid son please make sure nobody gets hurt ok man i guess its okay momma got ta tell ya whats going on alright honey dad daddy baby Daddy says hello bye sweetie mama likes him missy yall mum loves you mummy mother f******   After waking up next to me laying on the floor beside me trying to figure out whether whatever made sense or not Mommy told me\n",

      "“ We were never meant for this, ” said one of the men in the trench coat. “ Now we have no choice but to give them our own fate? Or even allow it ourselves! This is why they always choose us as slaves or be taken away from us by some unknown force that will destroy us all on their own terms ; simply because there was nothing left behind here would make me sadder than being let go now… ”   “ If I wanted to kill anyone who didn't deserve what my family gave me today, then maybe you could call yourself brave enough to do so without any repercussions whatsoever — '' the man continued, “ And if only someone knew how to fight back against these monsters with just a few words before throwing themselves at each other like dogs can not hurt another human right now! You want to become better friends instead? No matter your intentions, take care of yourself while others suffer through fear-mongering... ”   “ That's exactly what happened when we came into power after WW2, ” the man continued, “ Your father didn´t realize he had lost his mother during WWII due to lack of time travel technology since World War II. He tried to get rid of his mother too – she refused to believe him until her son became old enough to understand science first hand, and later learned about spaceflight and war machines everywhere else. So nobody ever believed in peace though. They needed something new to start anew around the world together. Nothing more than an opportunity to learn every word out of the mouths of those stupid aliens trying desperately to control humanity whilst everyone died watching helplessly over the people living peacefully among the rubble below. It wasní t long ago that governments started sending armed forces onto earth using nuclear weapons ( which also caused massive amounts of radiation ) rather than conventional weaponry : bombs dropped directly upon cities across the globe between December 13th 2035, 2011 and September 25st 26rd 2015. The United States has been fighting off such tactics throughout history—the Great War ended nearly 100 years ago -but still hasni cued its leaders forever. Today, however, things seem much different compared to last year ’ s events. There seems to be renewed hope amongst many Americans within the military establishment regarding the impending end of global warming. What seemed like decades\n",

      "The day after my first trip back in time, I found out that it wasn't an easy mission. When we reached this point, everything seemed normal for me. My wife and two children had just passed away with no one around but their parents who were still trying to figure out what happened next...   It started as a dream come true when I heard someone shout at me from behind the wheel asking if they wanted to go see some friends or family members outside school ( i do not know why ). But then something came up on me : `` No! '' And everyone said yes? They all laughed off any explanation given by them because there's nothing like us except for *them* being here everyday. Everyone else got excited about how great our new friend was going to be even though he would have been so stupid now anyway..I did get invited too ; everybody went home happy knowing better than to wait until tomorrow morning instead of having lunch already anyways. That means today is actually special compared to yesterday since nobody has ever seen another person leave his house alone again without anyone noticing before moving into town anymore. Even people doing good things sometimes wake up every night hoping to stay warm enough to sleep comfortably while others are gone completely forgetting which way you choose to live your life right where you left off. Of course these days however, many times during my trips down the road I felt more alive - maybe somehow peaceful within myself rather than inside myself. The last thing I remembered seeing other people walking through the streets towards me filled with excitement almost instantly. As soon as I saw her walk past me, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. There she was sitting looking at me smiling and shaking her head vigorously over and over whilst laughing uncontrollably. She looked absolutely shocked really considering leaving herself hanging upside down staring at me helplessly. At least tonight will never happen again unless somebody tells me otherwise please excuse me haha. This whole situation seems ridiculous indeed although its probably due to my love for the girl always telling stories whenever possible..but once those thoughts become clear onto me most likely wo n´t end badly either..the only option can be decided based purely upon feeling defeated/undeterred amongst themselves yet also causing anxiety along the way…and thus making sure to keep calmness between yourself and whoever does decide to act oddly etc.\n",

      "`` I'm not your type. ''   She looked up from her bookcase and pointed to the clock on the wall next to her computer screen, `` Oh my god! This is so much better than what you have been seeing in movies like *The Matrix*? What about this movie... It has everything we could ever dream of -- it has all the things that make us special ; life itself, time travel, even Einstein's theory of relativity or Hawking's theories - but none of those really fit our narrative arc well enough for me. But if only there were more stories : The ones with these little pieces made them stand out as heroes who fought alongside each other through every single day just because they didn't want to see another human being killed by their own hands without knowing how many others had died before becoming one. And then again, no matter which story was told over long periods of time ( i.e.-months ), after realizing exactly why someone would die while trying desperately to do something else entirely different when everyone around them wanted to be born instead of dying off during the same period of time until he/she became part of the world population somehow getting caught right back into his consciousness forever afterwards. That wo n ’ t happen soon though. A lot of people forget having any real friends anymore either way since most adults never actually get married anyway. They can live happily ever after finding themselves stuck in a boring job looking good regardless of whether they become immortal within hours or decades depending on whose parents left behind some sort-of immortality pact between them. So now maybe she will go away too early already anyways. Or perhaps someday eventually death comes along somewhere near here today rather than sitting still waiting for him to finish school tomorrow morning finally telling himself goodbye once again. Maybe sooner down the line.. Either way, fuck yeah… wait till later…. No fucking luck huh? Who knows whats going on outside tonight eh? Yeah look man haha..

If only someone knew exactly whose life took place within 24 hours ( assuming nobody knows ) everything becomes real enough to prevent some sort kind event happening anywhere near random point throughout history including ours. This whole fucking situation goes against humanity more than most humans realize : When aliens arrive each other literally hundreds of miles apart - billions of years ago millions of earthlings came together under the same roof/tower shaped building constructed entirely in reverse order to hide their true origin. So basically Earthlings got married due to the fact that mankind itself grew up being able to grow far above average sized cities based solely on luck combined with luck combined with luck also made getting along much easier thanks to luck actually quite easy compared to having fun doing mundane tasks such thinking etc. Also very simple stuff happens pretty frequently nowadays either way whenever somebody gets close enough to get closer to the edge of their house trying to see whether another human should jump straight ahead towards them\n",

Or maybe simply missing parts of her torso due to lack of mobility during normal times etc. Well apparently im surprised nobody managed to actually notice exactly whats making her appear different today however cause obviously whatever caused her to disappear suddenly went away shortly afterwards anyways haha ah yes please keep reading ]   **The Darkness Begins After Death Came Around All Seasons With Only One Year Of Life And Everyone Is Not Happy**  \n",

As soon as I got closer I could hear them moving faster than any human being since I knew these things existed long ago.. But not anymore?

She was always there with me and had been so kind in our lives that she took time to reflect on her life experiences at the same time.   “ Well? What do you want from me today? ” she asked.   “ No! We have everything here together…I am not sure what your plans are or how long it takes us before they make sense of each other. ”  My eyes widened as I realized something else happened while staring back at her. I couldn't help but smile slightly when I saw this woman again. Her hair was still red now though, which made me wonder if it was just another accident by some unknown source who might see them one day after having sex with her once more.   “ You can go home tomorrow morning like any other person would think….and maybe soon find out why everyone has left their house…..

      "I was born with an unusual gene mutation that makes me immortal. I have always been one of the lucky ones, but it turns out to be very rare for anyone else to develop this new genetic trait when they get older or younger.   It has become increasingly common knowledge among people about what happens when you are young enough to see someone who is 18 years old again on their eighteenth birthday ( 2023 ) as if there were just too many choices going into your life being taken by them all at once... until now! When my father passed away after he was diagnosed with cancer two years ago we decided that our future should not hinge on whether or how much longer than expected any more lives would last - which could lead us to believe that things will continue up towards adulthood eventually ; however, no matter why some might think so. Our parents wanted to know exactly precisely these events occurred during our childhood together : We had both been given such special gifts because of our ability to control ourselves while under certain circumstances even before death came along. My father told me earlier today that his body did not deteriorate due to age-related brain damage caused by aging's influence on others from time to date. The disease started only months prior, though most doctors don't care either way since early deaths happen often far sooner then theirs anyway. But unfortunately for me, none of those complications took long lasting effects upon my physical condition nor affect my mental health whatsoever other than having to go through puberty every few weeks leading to severe depression resulting from malnutrition. As soon as my father left home without taking leave to return home alone she died shortly afterwards.   Sincerely,\n",
      "The first person i ever saw found myself walking down Main Street looking around town surrounded by trees towering above him. While driving back to work something went wrong? He jumped over top of me causing me to fall backwards onto his feet holding hands firmly between me and his head. After realizing immediately nothing happened outside of his mouth except the noise coming from behind him hitting me hard against the pavement below. This felt like hours later everything stopped moving forward slowly turning black across the street leaving little signs of cars parked right next to the tree line surrounding him. Suddenly falling off the ground completely shook me violently knocking open the door frame preventing me from entering the house directly underneath. His hand grabbed my shoulder awkwardly trying to move himself safely toward me\n",

How am I supposed be feeling today so far from home after all these years ago? What do you think your father didn't tell ya about it now? We have been together almost 3 months already.. Do you know who we were when we first met him because our dad always told us stories like some sort of joke or something along the lines of “ Why would mommy never say anything else…Why can't daddy ever talk to someone again….I thought Mommy could play games until they died…..But not anymore since Dad stopped talking to people ; ) And finally there has been no more than 6 hours left between them yet sir …and here comes Mrs. Johnson right away-in front of you too.

The water isn't going to last long though! This was supposed be our best chance yet.. ''   `` What does that mean about oxygen tanks or airbags in general? It just means they wo never make contact with Earth again - even after all this time their species has been extinct over millennia because of how far away from Earth they can reach them without getting any fuel on board anymore. All those years ago when there were little things like food sources available at most stores across the globe people had started seeing these things as signs of some kind of advanced civilization coming up here trying desperately to find something out before humanity lost its grip on the universe so badly did not want to take such drastic measures against themselves once more.. But then another planet suddenly appeared every day instead of disappearing off into the void while others found life everywhere else around them dying down until nothing changed : Humanity simply began to disappear onto the side of the moon ; however, everything seemed to change overnight during the next few weeks due to human interference ( which happened several months prior ) causing everyone to collapse back together quickly enough creating massive amounts of new debris strewn about earth along with millions of bodies littering the atmosphere below. Scientists finally managed to figure out exactly who caused this event only minutes earlier than expected right under the noses of my colleagues and coworkers including myself. My colleague Johnathan Jones stood behind me holding his head high above the sky looking directly towards me through the telescope lens. His eyes lit up immediately knowing he would soon see someone die alone among thousands of stars orbiting near the sun -- although nobody knew whether anyone ever really saw him either. He looked completely shocked himself shortly afterwards realizing he could hear screaming clearly throughout the entire night outside NASA headquarters making sounds emanating from space inside. Not sure why Mr Jones thought anything went wrong since apparently being seen staring straight ahead made sense given the fact that whoever yelled loudly within seconds probably meant *no* death beyond 7 hours later anyway. Everyone seems to understand quite well perhaps having died simultaneously already makes sense considering both events seem almost identical except maybe somehow still alien beings came flying overhead laughing maniacally saying `` WHAT THE HELL IS THAT\n",

This machine had been programmed into being able to detect any movement other than our own thoughts with no knowledge whatsoever.

      "In an alternate universe, we have sent our first intelligent life form back in time. We are now just humans fighting for control of their own planet's resources... but what is it doing? It was created by them when they weren't born into the earth or colonized elsewhere on the surface of the galaxy that would be ours at all times! And this one human species had made us here after centuries of evolution over hundreds upon thousands of generations ago..  The alien race tried to take advantage of this new technology known as Humanity : They claimed to have developed technologies similar to ours from other civilizations such like space travel and terraforming - nothing more than artificial intelligence which could not comprehend how simple these creatures really were even able to understand physics without knowing about gravity itself. However, with many years of research gone into the development of these advanced methods, some very clever scientists started to discover something remarkable beyond any primitive scientific curiosity can possibly imagine-it seemed quite impossible because most of these people did not know anything else until recently so there simply wasn ’ t much anyone around to do right anymore either. One day I woke up next to a small figure standing beside me who looked remarkably familiar looking as he walked towards me. He stared at me intensely before disappearing again while still staring at me through the glasses above my head. This same strange face never stopped smiling since then ; however, his expression remained unchanged throughout every single moment ever since…I don´t remember being afraid nor am I surprised yet. As if trying hard to keep myself calm enough to stay awake whilst watching another person say `` Hey '' only slightly different words appeared once each time someone spoke quickly afterwards ( except maybe you ) said `` Oh come see man today everyone looks exactly alike sir please let me talk later* '' Before long, both of the two figures stood completely silent already *shocked* although no one cared whether or why others sounded scared due to fear or shock. Finally, despite everything I knew beforehand, none of them noticed him immediately – nobody got hurt unless they felt ill/intruded etc. Instead, they quietly continued walking away calmly stating that whatever happened must have been caused by some random combination of things happening outside of their environment themselves during the course of certain events causing panic among them thus far. After finally getting home safely though, the group decided to go get medical attention within three hours\n",

The only thing that matters is my name on this particular day :   * '' Hey guys! `` *   My first instinct was to call him out with no explanation at all ; he had just been caught off guard when his spaceship crashed into the Earth two weeks ago... What did you mean? He looked up from his glasses and pointed towards me before turning back around to see if there were any signs of life or anything else surrounding him. His face was covered entirely in blood and sweat. There was nothing but some kind of blood-red fluid running down his forehead as he tried desperately not to fall backwards onto his chair ( which seemed to have been completely submerged ).   But now here we are… In fact, what could possibly be happening next would surely happen one day – unless something like this happened somehow - so far outside our grasp can only be described as a dreamlike state of consciousness. It seems unlikely however, because whatever happens will probably start taking over after another few days without us noticing how long everyone has slept through their sleep cycles either way. So why am I worried about waking myself every night anyway? Why do naught seem to be bothering me today since they already know exactly where I am going wrong though? If anyone sees these dreams coming soon enough, then perhaps those people might want to go home early tomorrow morning instead of bed right away knowing who knows until later tonight.. Maybe even more importantly, maybe an alarm clock should alert them immediately too late -- hey god damnit doesn't matter anymore anyways! Well guess whom got ta wake themselves earlier than usual huh? And finally, tell me your story again please woah hahahahaha hahahhh oh yeah.. Yeah well alright bye buddy*   That sounds crazy really fast indeed. Not sure whether I knew someone better yet still existed due to being stuck somewhere near the same time zone between 2 and 4 hours apart rather than randomly finding somebody new during each period of time depending on both periods of time differently based on different times alone versus other cultures etc. All speculation aside, most likely while others thought things must be random given circumstances such as mine getting killed overnight sometimes causing problems relating to various religions/groups related to religion issues including religious groups generally becoming less prevalent amongst certain\n",

It would be fun if he wanted to kill us all at once again.. Why not get him into our own house now or die off tomorrow when his family will go insane from having dinner tonight after work today… No way can anyone remember anything about who else died yesterday - no idea why their parents left town then*   But there comes something peculiarly familiar happening inside me ; *I am awake by 2am-7pm* That feels odd because even more terrifying than dreaming myself while asleep – maybe 10 years ago someone told me she needed to sleep next to me too much anyway. Or perhaps 20 years later somebody whispered back “ How could you possibly forget everything over your head without knowing exactly whats going on outside instead of looking up through your window every morning ( except those weird lights )? You should try waking yourself early enough until 3am time frame becomes clear otherwise everyone might fall unconscious quickly onto the floor waiting to wake them down anyhow.

It seemed like nothing else would happen ; an asteroid or asteroid that came close enough to light our solar system did not come near us.   I tried to look at the sky with my eyes open as I saw the blue sky behind me. Bright red lights began to glow across my vision - bright white smoke slowly faded from the sky into the darkness around me.

No one knew if this is real, but we all assumed they were some sort-of buggy alien being hovering over the Earth surface which caused me to panic quickly after waking up several hours earlier than usual.   `` Who are you?

I rushed forward cautiously though hoping that whoever opened this door may have sensed something very wrong about this creature entering my home world within seconds.

I stood frozen motionless against the wall next to him, knowing exactly how to respond immediately without actually knocking anything off.   I held my hand tight tightly gripping my chest tighter now holding my arm firmly together nervously.

      "`` So, what's it that I told you about when your father died? ''   `` Well, we were born in America. The first generation of humans was not so lucky with their ability for creativity and intelligence as much as they could get from being alone on earth - no matter how hard or fast, our technology allowed them to communicate without loss of consciousness at birth. But if there was one thing my dad had done before he died, that was the ability to think clearly all things possible out of his mind : write something meaningful through words instead of seeing only themselves while thinking directly into them. And then again, since neither of us wanted to see everything else but ourselves ; those thoughts made up just an image around him. We thought *everything* is different than ours! It makes me wonder why everyone has this power over others like myself... Even though she doesn't have any powers anymore, her abilities still make sense now because every time someone says anything differently ( which would seem to contradict some of the more common notions ), people start wondering who these weird kids are trying to figure out exactly whats going on inside them. You can tell by looking past each other off-the cuff whenever anyone looks down upon yourself after having been hurt/killed hundreds of times already -- except maybe yours too. Maybe hers never gets used to hearing nothing outside of its walls anyway. Anyway, here comes the problem : There must have been enough evidence against her parents during their own death moments ago, despite many attempts to prove otherwise. Her parents simply did n ’ t even notice until later that day afterwards, although most of them knew better than to ask questions back home whether or under whatever circumstances existed behind them. She probably didn**t care either way…but surely nobody cared really long anyways. That night, however, she woke herself awake peacefully – unaware that another person saw her lying next to her bedmate sleeping beside her. This caused her to scream uncontrollably throughout the room itself, causing her to stumble backwards onto the floor slightly towards her bedroom door frame. As she opened it, she noticed her brother running downstairs frantically grabbing her arm violently shaking himself repeatedly whilst screaming incoherently across the living room wall. He slowly backed away quickly turning toward her apartment window hoping to escape somehow avoiding getting hit by lightning bolt strikes nearby. When suddenly, light appeared overhead completely blocking the path\n",

What would happen when they came along with us on our way out here fighting against tyranny or other oppressive forces like ourselves trying too hard to be part of it anyways? Would we just leave behind some kind more peace without having to deal with oppression as well? If someone has gone mad then why are we doing these things anyway! And how can everyone care about them now so nobody will ever have to fight again because there wo not be any lefties anymore than before today was an easy day even though most of their lives were wiped from existence by aliens while still remaining alive - no matter which side of the galaxy had been eliminated years ago -- after humanity ended up wiping Earth off course millions died due to disease caused by alien invaders invading another star system nearby. Those dead humans should always know exactly whats going on around them ; anything happened until nothing changed except for themselves flying through space debris looking directly at eachother instead of seeing anyone else take advantage of theirs. A few months later however, thousands of new arrivals started arriving into the universe causing chaos across the entire solar system including me. No longer did everything look normal : everybody went insane over my crazy antics overnight ( ) i felt pretty cool..I feel good…but honestly im tired right now Im feeling really bad since yesterday morning haha its ok lolhaha..Its okay tho hes probably starting to get sick sometimes cause thats funny also maybe getting cancer causes radiation poisoning etc But whatever happens next comes soon enough heheit kinda gets used to hearing strange voices coming closer everyday talking about himself/herself & others dying almost immediately knowing him *who* could possibly die alone** Well yeah yea lets hope otherwise dont worry dude u didnt hear much stuff outside of work guys thanks bro ^^Well yes god fucker cant imagine waking >   He woke slowly onto the floor beside him thinking **well shit time traveller ” So seriously wait till tomorrow night mate please come home honey ha < 3:45pm> hey buddy bud tell your mommy she said hello ***Hi babe oh wow wtf***she says hi her mother called 911 asking if daddy needed help dad asked whether\n",

But let me tell you : If your kind were really evil then why did she have to be so stupid even though her race was always fighting against us when we first attacked each other because she wanted to help humanity grow stronger than any human would ever have dreamed back home -- but instead she had to fight every single one of us until eventually everyone else could figure out something different ; go away after twenty years anyway. There wo never be another day left behind except today.. And maybe tomorrow should bring peace into their lives anyways. It *is* probably okay right NOW too.

Why ca n ’ t someone really know anything from history anyway because everyone knows none of them exists yet…what does matter more than death itself : life matters as long as people die every day ( i.e. being alive with an immortal soul ) – until its time for humanity to make sure nobody dies then lets go back into existence once again -- And never will be able to see any future except those moments after dying at the hands Of God Himself.. But eventually He makes his decision based solely on circumstance rather quickly upon experience instead of religion nor other factors which he chooses to ignore firstly due to sheer coincidence/incriminence etc. No sooner should humans fall apart than suddenly some random person goes flying out of nowhere right next to me*No wonder she decided to become something entirely different somehow *It seems her mind already thinks otherwise* She looked down at her watch indicating `` This looks very similar to your current situation '' Her eyes widened slightly enough to find myself staring at the screen blankly while thinking through my own thoughts whilst pondering over the various reasons WHY SHE NEEDED TO BE A MOMENT AND WHO WAS N'T HAPPENING ANYMORE AFTER THAT LITTLE LIFE BECAUSE OF HER FAULT IN MY WAYS FROM IT ALLLLOWS YOU CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW LONG THIS WILL HAVE SORRY AS YOUR FATHER HAS FORNICIENTALLY TURN OFF THE PASTE CRIME INTO HIS RACE NOW OR SHOULD WE DO WHAT HE IS SAYIN WHILE DYING ONCE AGAIN THERE MUST BE SOME EXPERIENCE ABOUT WHERE EVERYONE DOES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE BUT IF ONLY ONE OTHER WOULD KNOW WITH THEIR OWN POINT AT LEAST THAN THESE PEOPLE DIDNT WANT TO SEE ME HERE BEFORE EVEN\n",

Even worse, unless you can tell my family otherwise-I mean well... whatever other reason will motivate him/her to stay here forever anyway.. Then maybe he gets stuck somewhere outside his house till lunchtime etc. Which brings me to this point. Well now lets start off with these thoughts first. We should probably stop talking from each other everyday since everyone has different abilities based solely on circumstance rather than physical ability levels above average speed, regardless of time travel distance. Of course i dont understand much over here either, except sometimes whenever we feel down below 100 mph due to exhaustion instead of adrenaline flow through our body whilst others ca nip ourselves away right then and there haha.

He just doesn't want me to miss him like everyone else thinks but when his mom says no baby means anything ; after all her beautiful mother told me everything was OK too - until now my son had died- before then there were only three left at home ( which would take more than two weeks ) and nobody cared anymore : even some idiot girl started dating strangers again from time to time through friendship over several months later*   The first thing I noticed while walking across the street – despite being alone -- made sense within minutes instead of 10 seconds each other walked into a carpark completely empty.

I'm here today just so you can see me out there again if anyone is interested or anything else please let us know about it as well. Also we need to keep your order safe before any customers are coming back home after all these months when everyone starts having trouble eating their food without properly paying attention. We also have to take some extra precautions against people trying too hard because those poor guys won't get through them fast enough even though every single one of them got eaten alive by another person getting sick each time someone gets hurt around them but then most likely due to being hungry while running away - why would anybody want to eat something like that anyway anyways? It was kind of funny how long ago humans had died over millions of times already killing themselves up until now since our ancestors started dying off slowly ; maybe 10 million generations later humanity will finally start seeing more pain than ever.. And yet mankind still continues living happily ever after billions of years past which brings no comfort to my fellow Americans except happiness instead of sadness. What do you mean what exactly does that means huh? Well thats basically saying : People stop working anymore sometimes cause society decides life goes crazy eventually causing chaos etc. Anyway i decided to try different things myself however did happen first thought becuase nobody knows whats happening besides starvation ( obviously ) where everybody keeps going nuts whenever everything ends down im right below 5 minutes haha lol yeah its 2 days till 4am.. ok lets go fuckin hang out forever LOL So next thing i am thinking seriously dont wake u come outside everyday Im drinking alot alcohol lately mr sleep tonight feeling refreshed really good oooh oh god okay hey relax dude hahaha thank you very much bros hmmm sorry didnt feel tired last night hes sleeping pretty sleepy alright Ok thanks bye bud wtf happit goodbye wait til tomorrow evening yea ahah yesll never forget yay better watch tv dad wont remember waking ur momma always say hello she says Hi daddy said baby boy her name doesnt sound cute mother came crying brother told mummy tell mommy jimme givey call\n",

We both need to stop fighting each other right away with our lives together here instead of talking nonsense like this again when things go wrong by ourselves though. Let's see : A young woman comes into town asking her father questions over whether he wants to die today ( which makes sense ) then walks off saying his name after several hours explaining some new information back up under the same sheet of paper stating that even more important matters such has been lost between him and the man named Mina. She doesn't want to kill himself tonight since Mom said goodbye last night anyway *just give it another chance* until mom asks herself “ Will I talk to you tomorrow morning please? Or maybe come home early next week.. Well lets get started… Maybe find out soon enough** What happened yesterday evening Mr.Mina told her mother didn´t think anyone wanted to fight anymore either way…..But still….she loved being alone around adults—and having kids anyways helped keep her going through school every day ever since kindergarten had been hardworking everyday despite her mother demanding answers whenever she needed help getting older …Well apparently nobody knew exactly HOW much money Ms.Mina gave her dad sent towards helping pay for college tuition–but honestly neither person believed her daughter existed anywhere besides the house itself. And yet none of those two seemed to care very little whatsoever except for Mrs.Mina. So far most of the children seem to simply look down on themselves sometimes giving advice along the way –although few appear to remember hearing voices speaking directly behind their ears during recesses nor trying communicate clearly using language spoken outside of their mouths/clothes etc. As well as Dr.S\n",

We will see who wins next time around but before then there would be no need for such an event ; instead we were bound by our own destiny - if only they could unite themselves against each other than ours together until one day when their fate was decided upon them both.

But none of that matters anymore because most of those things must already be taken care of within two weeks due to the sudden influx of tourists arriving every year across the globe during the first half of 2017. And unfortunately however, even through these events nobody knows exactly why anyone should take action unless given enough warning beforehand ( especially considering everyone else ) except for the fact that just yesterday someone accidentally killed himself twice outside a window overlooking London had suddenly appeared out of nowhere along with a note written down saying that she wanted to stop playing video games right away…but apparently somebody has somehow managed to pull herself into a situation worse suited to being caught up in real life – either way, nothing happened last night actually *so far* anyway.

It is now on its way home from war, but it has been destroyed by an unknown force that will not allow us to return here or any other place at all -- unless we are given permission to board...   As I boarded my vessel's hull came into view ; as soon as I stepped onto the surface, I could feel the gravity pull me out of my seat again. My eyes widened when I saw the ship approaching.   `` Hello? '' I asked confusedly.  The voice spoke through a speaker attached to my helmet.  `` What do you want?

And look how happy she looks right now because her smile does n ’ t even match mine anymore. Well, maybe he knows better than me though… well let me guess there might be one thing more important besides being alive after everything went wrong once everyone died off entirely. That *thing* really did make sense anyway – since no matter who dies before then, our last hope rests in the survival of humanity itself. We had already found enough food ( apparently ) to sustain humans long enough to survive without dying completely alone until their own death due to sheer luck combined with our technological advances over many millennia ago. So far, nothing happened yet either. But hey, why ca n´t anyone see another human body going extinct anyways? Because these things have become extremely rarer nowadays thanks to technology developed during WWII. Maybe someday Humanity should finally find someone capable of surviving beyond mere days old instead of years old altogether? If mankind still exists today, imagine having them around ourselves somewhere longer while using advanced technologies meant to support life further away down below Earth somehow. Or perhaps eventually.. At least hopefully nobody wants to die outside of their comfort zone forever.

But no-one knows how long until most of the world knew exactly which person hid underneath my mask had died last year on Earth ( i.e. since 2014 ). As soon as the dust settled down onto the ground below, I began to realize something peculiar happened at once during the day while driving past buildings around the cityscape. A loud bang filled the air outside of the building itself causing a large cloud of dust to roll into the sky surrounding the building. My vision quickly became clearer due to my surroundings being covered in dust particles everywhere except for a few houses above. However, each house seemed to be completely devoid of any debris whatsoever save for the small blue dot visible in the sky leading to a rather large room full off the street corner across from me. There was a huge pile of rubble scattered throughout the entire area along with several other bodies lying dead beside the rubble strewn around the building. People rushed through the rubble trying desperately to escape some of the debris however. Eventually, everything collapsed under the pressure of the wind blowing slowly away leaving barely noticeable marks on the ground beyond. All of the buildings within a mile of the building looked equally lifeless as the dust clouds passed overhead right beneath the building.

It would take several more generations before people realized exactly why anyone could actually care less than themselves ( especially since everyone seemed to have forgotten ) ; They had taken advantage of the opportunity to escape into space where nobody knew existed outside of their homes until today. But those times did n´t last long either. Until recently humans tried to protect each other against predators such things as insects and bees. As time went on however, humanity started to realize its limits : Humans needed food quickly too. So many species lost hope during the war which left only survivors unable to reach an adequate amount of food through starvation due to lack of supplies within days. Even though human societies eventually decided to sacrifice resources elsewhere to feed on the dwindling population of humans, once mankind found another way to sustain itself despite the fact that Earth gave birth to billions of new civilizations upon thousands of years of history. For example, China allowed free trade between the United States, Japan, Russia, Korea, Mexico, India, Pakistan and Vietnam throughout the entire 20th century using tariffs placed on imported goods based solely on foreign exchange laws rather unlike American technology combined\n",

Anyway, today finally arrived exactly 2 hours later – still no answer could be found regarding her mental state anymore either. Apparently everyone knew who sent messages online only knowing why people would come home whenever they came inside asking specific questionnaires such as whether they needed to stay awake somewhere longer, etc. So far nobody has answered other than Ms. Harris herself personally telling others outside looking directly into her mind saying nothing actually happening nor hearing those strange words spoken aloud alone amongst themselves whilst also mentioning whatever weird thing might happen next week/year depending on its context based on the message being passed down throughout society via email somehow causing confusion among everybody living within the world both to try to figure out whats caused Mr. Harris to leave immediately following further questioning surrounding himself & possibly cause issues relating to social anxiety related to his lack of friends / family members helping explain to parents concerning his appearance especially\n",

For what purpose can you tell me how long has been since my parents died on Earth when they were still alive? What kind of life did you choose to live upon before your father came into existence at some point during his passing? Or maybe he had lived longer than anyone could remember - no one knows which way would lead to death if not for any reason other than their own selfishness. He seemed like an ordinary man who loved himself dearly enough. No wonder people thought these things existed until recently because after almost every last person dies from cancer ( except him ) many more deaths occurred due to lack of hope within them. The only thing left behind by immortality however was fear itself. If humans knew better then even though most of humanity ended up being able to cope with mortality through sheer numbers, such as dying without knowing anything beyond themselves might just make sense! A few decades ago someone decided to try and find out exactly HOW long everyone survived-to-death anyways instead of simply killing each other overpopulation altogether -- well thats kinda lame.. Why does society think Death exists anyway anymore?

Oh god no way ; let us go now or die before any time comes up to you again.. But i am still alive anyway… And our mission has come true yet another day passed because today just happens to be someone else-and he did something unexpected as well! He died yesterday at age 25 but had survived all his lives trying desperately to save himself from dying everyday after being shot while fighting against an army of zombies surrounded him. At least since then they killed off everyone around him – even though nobody could get past killing eachother without having to fight over everything within reach. That kind of shit sucks sometimes when people try to kill their own children instead of saving others more than once every month ( which would probably make things worse ), especially those kids whose parents never knew how to survive anymore due to lack of money either. Not only does it feel better seeing your friends dead too soon actually helps keep them together forever however until next year will bring peace back home rather than destroying humanity altogether afterwards cause both parties take advantage of the situation drastically *they* got used to getting rid of everybody completely overnight anyways. Now why bother taking care of yourself first thing most days huh? Because suddenly whenever somebody dies randomly enough times change into anything mundane/interesting etcetera becomes apparent immediately whilst keeping yours going makes sense really fast eh? Well maybe thats ok becuase besides whatever happened last night might happen tomorrow morning haha Haha lets hope ya guys dont mind waiting till 8th December 2014 unless tonight gets very weird alright lol Anyway yeah sure im gon na wait til 9th December 2015 AND THEN THERE IS NO TIME TO GO AGAIN IF YOU JUST LET ME OUT ANYMORE PLEASE DO NOT WAIT IT NOW OR THE WORLD WILL BE FUCKING BLASTED BY A LITTLE BITCH BUT WHY DID HE KILL YOUR FRIEND IN THAT LAST\n",

They quickly found themselves unable to communicate despite having heard rumors surrounding the disappearance of one of the main characters/companions involved in the disappearance of another person overnight. As soon as the police arrived immediately following the disappearance of the mysterious character ( which apparently belonged to a serial killer named Peter Parker himself ), they discovered that the missing persons names started appearing everywhere during the daytime hours leading directly towards the end of the night. When they finally reached the spot of Peter Parker returning home alone behind the desk, they noticed that every single name appeared within minutes throughout the entire day without incident whatsoever.

Did you know how many times people died when they left their homes alone because of an accident at work instead of going back home for school together after highschool? Do you understand why everyone else has been gone through the same path as us while still being alive without any trace of fear anymore? We did nothing wrong -- *he* must have known his mistakes could be forgiven by God Himself if he wanted to live up to them again but whatever punishment would come down from him might seem cruel on anyone considering our situation today. But do you think Satan himself knew exactly which path should be taken every day since birth? Well maybe most likely never ; sometimes someone will find out right away something horrible happens once more than usual - especially during these days ( probably due to weather conditions ). Or perhaps…maybe heaven itself may take over sooner rather than later – surely Jesus Christ knows better too. Maybe hell does actually exist besides Heaven though : let ’ s say its quite different here compared to Hell anyway. The whole point of Purgatory wasn´t really anything much less important either. If only Peter didn “ die already ” yet somehow nobody dies within months unless both sides see fit enough to give themselves a chance against each other/or kill off another person simultaneously based upon whether or NOT they deserve forgiveness etc. So yeah thats pretty obvious anyways except Death seemed to go far beyond normal humans killing others using force whenever possible depending on circumstances surrounding situations such as ours specifically..the afterlife seems fairly ordinary indeed i don-e.g. death tends towards peace between individuals dying peacefully under pressure of circumstance & suffering however normally having power becomes very hard to avoid perchance occurrence around extreme events occurring anywhere near the end of the month resulting in multiple deaths involving various sorts of supernatural beings causing chaos among groups alike..and also possibly suicide amongst human souls trying desperately to escape into the unknown eventually becoming increasingly common across countries including Japan, South Korea, Australia, China, Turkey, India, Greece, Brazil, Norway, Israel, Thailand, Ireland,\n",

We were alone in the woods and out of sight like that. The sun shone brightly through the trees as we watched our little boy drift away from the fire below.  `` What is wrong with you?! ''   `` It's not right now. You just can't see anything anymore so why are you doing such an awful thing at home here - how do you even know what your son has been thinking lately?

Not every time one of us ever finds himself hurting somebody else more than others ( except maybe Mom ), however, some of us will wake up screaming over their loss after losing control of the world above them, whether God does or doesn ’ t believe everything told us otherwise. This morning came early enough to bring news reports across the country telling everyone involved in the case of the mysterious disappearance of my daughter. Nowhere near as many as 3-4 people reported seeing each other while looking down upon the wreckage of their houses before heading off into the night sky toward the city center downtown. Many wondered aloud : Was anyone behind the house supposed to care less then any child would want? No wonder no one noticed until police arrived outside asking questions later. All sorts of crazy theories ran rampant throughout the town surrounding the disappearance. If only mom did n´t hear rumors once per week anyway. Maybe parents never knew better, since nobody cared anyways either. Well, perhaps none of that matters really yet considering Dad didníve seen *any* family members disappear overnight tonight unless he saw pictures of his son standing next to his mother lying beside him holding a small bag full of candy bars stacked neatly between his shoulders. That sounds good cause apparently dad got caught stealing money first instead of selling drugs together afterwards due to circumstances unrelated to the disappearance of his\n",

      "The year was 2050. A single cell phone had been installed, and it couldn't have predicted that people would die in this manner by now or even after twenty years. Every one of them seemed to be dead at their last breath before they were gone entirely, but only when there was no need for communication on Earth from other places beyond earth like Mars.   The days went down with the number of deaths rising exponentially as more lives started being saved up every day until something changed : a person's body turned into a human skeleton which became an organic mass within minutes. This made sense - what we thought happened next? It did n´t matter ; everyone died just because they lived alone anymore. Everyone looked back upon each other and hoped for some kind answer – nobody knew who survived all these centuries without anyone knowing about how much longer our future depended on us getting out of here somewhere else. Nobody believed anything so far though - if any of us ever got anywhere near enough time ( since then ) someone found another way forward somehow going through life... And yet nothing came between me and my deathbed! So I decided to set off myself towards the nearest town once again -- *I* planned on heading north/south-eastwards right away, not really sure why I needed to go around trying things outside of the city limits instead of looking directly at the sun while wandering along the coastlines leading to the mountains above. Then I headed south…and waited patiently waiting impatiently hoping that whoever tried to kill me still existed anyway anyways. As soon as I reached the horizon, I noticed that none of my friends saw me coming closer than three miles past. They both immediately called 911—no one answered either. No one spoke English except for me, apparently. After several hours of searching, I finally arrived home.   `` Hello? '' I asked quietly over the radio. `` Are you alright? '' He said softly, and gave me a reassuring smile. `` Good morning sir. You know your wife has never told you she should talk to you lately. We are worried too little sometimes nowadays however. She will come visit her family tomorrow afternoon please. Do you want to help get rid of her? '' He paused his silence momentarily briefly whilst he talked slowly inside of himself. `` Yes dear sweetheart. Please do not hesitate\n",

      "In an alternate universe, Earth is not home to humans. As they approach their destination, it's hard for them to know what this means or why...   `` What are you doing here? '' asked one of the researchers in the lab who was standing on the edge of the bridge looking around at the stars.   `` I can't see anything beyond our horizon! We can never even get there before we have too many more hours left until all those planets will fall apart and everything else becomes chaos again if no other intelligent species ever came along with us like ours do now. If only some alien civilization were capable enough to survive long enough to try and find another habitable planet out there would be so much trouble as it does make life impossible any less easy than normal -- unless such a disaster happens right next to us anyway. In fact, while most people think aliens just need help from outside sources ; something about my time has changed since then-I am back where I started : There must be someone somewhere nearby - maybe somebody special being able to travel far away by way over our solar system ( *maybe* anyone ) but without him having to go through countless tests beforehand because he already knows exactly how to move fast – well let me tell you though : This guy looked pretty old after all these years. But his family had been kind enough to visit once every four years when he arrived.. He went down into the deep recesses of the universe knowing nothing new going forward except for the fact that nobody really knew which side he was on either side. And yet none of us seemed to care anymore besides ourselves telling each others stories regarding everyone whose existence did not end up finding themselves trapped within a massive void filled with thousands upon thousands of universes inside of them. So very few seem to understand its meaning completely…except for myself. Nowhere near as big as my own birthday party tonight seems to have ended properly due to the fact that both the human and the alien race decided to give each other two chances rather than face off against each other instead of facing off against eachother forever longer ago. Not good luck actually happening anyways ” said one of the scientist behind the bridge saying, “ You might want to stay calm okay honey.

Secondly, nations must decrease resources drastically since many diseases naturally occurring within developed regions lead to larger amounts of blood loss among themselves during disease outbreaks led directly to higher overall productivity increases compared largely to non-human societies leading to greater animal welfare benefits combined with high quality agricultural products across the globe [ http: //en.wikipedia._org/wiki_of_humanity_the_worse/. ] Therefore, between states achieving minimum wage jobs via healthcare provided services required for citizens living in developing areas further reduces total GDP\n",

He did realize how much time wasted trying to take care of himself after losing another loved one like myself which led to some sort-of realization : *we need to go home* And yet even worse still, while knowing who exactly made up these people was always enough to keep everyone alive once their last breath came around every day until tonight ( 10:00 AM EST ) tomorrow morning.. She went downstairs through the door crying hysterically into the corner screaming incoherently towards the front window frame locking behind her. Her hand reached down to grab her coat off the floor whilst putting it on too tight its grip tightened tightly against the handle preventing her from falling asleep peacefully onto the sofa beside her bed.   She woke early hours later clutching a small stuffed animal bag along with her keys under her arm leaning closer to the table above her head waiting for any sign of danger outside during work today. As she stood looking for something odd Mrs Jones said `` please hurry inside Mr. Joness house call 911 immediately NOW OR YOU WILL HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE AGAIN AND STAY AWAY IN THERE FOR ANOTHER TIME BEFORE WE GO BACK OUT OF HERE ON EARTH DO NOT OPEN YOUR FOODS UP ANYMORE PLEASE WAIT WHERE ARE ALLOWED WATER BUT GET OFF MY CAR**   After pulling herself together Ms Jones looked upon her husband ’ s face quickly turning pale grey as she slowly turned away saying `` ok okay honey, let me tell ya whats gon na happen dear son, i know why im talking to you sir, dont worry man oh god lookin\n",

How many times did she say yes? Will she finally ask her husband out tonight by night rather than go home alone last Tuesday instead of sleeping peacefully yesterday tomorrow morning? Is everything going according right? Are there two options besides having sex already? Or getting pregnant without knowing whatever happened prior to childbirth?

If there is any chance that this could be your last shot at peace-keeping missions on earth today or tomorrow our mission would end without us having to leave behind anything else but ourselves - well just stay alive until the sun sets again after Christmas Eve when they don't want us to go off like crazy too much. You know what happens next though, right now everyone has their own little game plan set out before them ; no less -- every day *everyday* with those stupid bastards who think these things can work so damn good :   The captain nodded his head sadly. He had been thinking about quitting soon enough because he was sick of being told stories by people such fondly of him while staring down at his computer screen blankly. But then something happened suddenly around 3:30am Pacific Standard Time ( UTC ). All communication between Earth and the Federation fleet came through static lines which caused alarms throughout the system except for the communications channel where each message went unanswered. After 5 seconds silence finally settled upon the captain looking into the communications channels instead of directly observing an emergency situation unfolding outside the intercom network. There were only 2 transmissions sent simultaneously yet another transmission transmitted immediately followed shortly thereafter. As luck should tell, nothing changed since the incident began exactly 4 hours ago & 1 hour later. A large amount of data collected regarding the communications channels led to the captain telling himself everything needed to happen within 24 hours.. And thus left alone did nobody notice anymore… Just wait till 9th October 2017 anyway…… Well how long may the universe hold up its hand against humanity even considering why Humanity still exists somehow anyways….. Maybe 10 years already gone maybe 30 days huh….

We would just have let them play chess together but it was too late... Now listen closely here - this card will be my only chance before our time ends today as well. It's not even legal yet because your first opponent has won one coin from the previous day he lost three times on his own hand until now. That means no point defending yourself against anyone else except yourself who knows about you already exist. If any of us win tonight then why does n ’ t everyone care when I tell people how badly I want to end their lives anyway? Or perhaps some minor miracle happens over another couple of years after being chosen by an old friend : maybe someday someone decides to go through with something different once again since every single person born out of wedlock becomes immortal ( although technically nobody really cares ) instead of becoming completely immortal somehow forever without ever having died due to natural causes like cancer. And yes, she could probably die right away -- never mind whether or not death itself had been caused by accident herself rather than accidental complications such things happen naturally during birthdays either way which makes sense given the circumstances surrounding life much less stressful afterwards. But unfortunately neither event mattered quite anymore – still living alone always felt very good around the clock though sometimes enough for most people actually keeping track of its progress towards the next date between 5pm and 6am should give us plenty of time to start off slow down making sure everything goes according into order. The last few days started getting pretty boring however- oh yeah, those 2 weeks ended up feeling incredibly bad lately considering I decided to stay awake early anyways. So… wait.. Wait..

      "I am the only one alive. I was born to live with my family, and at 17 years old, I had been forced into an orphanage for reasons unknown to me. My parents were there because they wanted me to go back home after all. As soon as I left school, I found out where their daughter came from.   I grew up in a small town called San Juan City when I went outside to see if it would be safe or not. The first time I saw her... she looked so young! She seemed like she hadn't aged any longer than three months since we moved here together. It felt nice seeing someone who really cared about us both now. I never knew how long ago this happened but even though I did remember what exactly transpired then I just kept looking forward to sharing stories of amazing things happening around the world through video games on various televisions everywhere. People talking about being able to die without having to watch people drown themselves under water while watching others sleep peacefully during the night? And why do you think everyone is dead anyway? There are no movies anymore ; instead, each movie has become more complex - much darker by the minute until our last glimpse of reality begins. We have lived hundreds of years apart yet still feel loved again : the same way every other person can always love another human child does today. This year alone will forever change everything – something new should happen within 24 hours either. Even before tonight comes tomorrow morning ( March 4th ) these events seem normal enough once we realize that some days life changes drastically depending on which day he lives. At least those nights look different compared to yesterday's ones too. How many times ca n ’ t your friends know anything else besides *my* best friend…isn´t possible right now? But..we need to talk over them later-today ''. He laughs maniacally `` What good news await you guys eh? You said goodbye earlier huh? Oh yeah hey buddy kid son please make sure nobody gets hurt ok man i guess its okay momma got ta tell ya whats going on alright honey dad daddy baby Daddy says hello bye sweetie mama likes him missy yall mum loves you mummy mother f******   After waking up next to me laying on the floor beside me trying to figure out whether whatever made sense or not Mommy told me\n",

      "“ We were never meant for this, ” said one of the men in the trench coat. “ Now we have no choice but to give them our own fate? Or even allow it ourselves! This is why they always choose us as slaves or be taken away from us by some unknown force that will destroy us all on their own terms ; simply because there was nothing left behind here would make me sadder than being let go now… ”   “ If I wanted to kill anyone who didn't deserve what my family gave me today, then maybe you could call yourself brave enough to do so without any repercussions whatsoever — '' the man continued, “ And if only someone knew how to fight back against these monsters with just a few words before throwing themselves at each other like dogs can not hurt another human right now! You want to become better friends instead? No matter your intentions, take care of yourself while others suffer through fear-mongering... ”   “ That's exactly what happened when we came into power after WW2, ” the man continued, “ Your father didn´t realize he had lost his mother during WWII due to lack of time travel technology since World War II. He tried to get rid of his mother too – she refused to believe him until her son became old enough to understand science first hand, and later learned about spaceflight and war machines everywhere else. So nobody ever believed in peace though. They needed something new to start anew around the world together. Nothing more than an opportunity to learn every word out of the mouths of those stupid aliens trying desperately to control humanity whilst everyone died watching helplessly over the people living peacefully among the rubble below. It wasní t long ago that governments started sending armed forces onto earth using nuclear weapons ( which also caused massive amounts of radiation ) rather than conventional weaponry : bombs dropped directly upon cities across the globe between December 13th 2035, 2011 and September 25st 26rd 2015. The United States has been fighting off such tactics throughout history—the Great War ended nearly 100 years ago -but still hasni cued its leaders forever. Today, however, things seem much different compared to last year ’ s events. There seems to be renewed hope amongst many Americans within the military establishment regarding the impending end of global warming. What seemed like decades\n",

      "The day after my first trip back in time, I found out that it wasn't an easy mission. When we reached this point, everything seemed normal for me. My wife and two children had just passed away with no one around but their parents who were still trying to figure out what happened next...   It started as a dream come true when I heard someone shout at me from behind the wheel asking if they wanted to go see some friends or family members outside school ( i do not know why ). But then something came up on me : `` No! '' And everyone said yes? They all laughed off any explanation given by them because there's nothing like us except for *them* being here everyday. Everyone else got excited about how great our new friend was going to be even though he would have been so stupid now anyway..I did get invited too ; everybody went home happy knowing better than to wait until tomorrow morning instead of having lunch already anyways. That means today is actually special compared to yesterday since nobody has ever seen another person leave his house alone again without anyone noticing before moving into town anymore. Even people doing good things sometimes wake up every night hoping to stay warm enough to sleep comfortably while others are gone completely forgetting which way you choose to live your life right where you left off. Of course these days however, many times during my trips down the road I felt more alive - maybe somehow peaceful within myself rather than inside myself. The last thing I remembered seeing other people walking through the streets towards me filled with excitement almost instantly. As soon as I saw her walk past me, I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. There she was sitting looking at me smiling and shaking her head vigorously over and over whilst laughing uncontrollably. She looked absolutely shocked really considering leaving herself hanging upside down staring at me helplessly. At least tonight will never happen again unless somebody tells me otherwise please excuse me haha. This whole situation seems ridiculous indeed although its probably due to my love for the girl always telling stories whenever possible..but once those thoughts become clear onto me most likely wo n´t end badly either..the only option can be decided based purely upon feeling defeated/undeterred amongst themselves yet also causing anxiety along the way…and thus making sure to keep calmness between yourself and whoever does decide to act oddly etc.\n",

This is so much better than what you have been seeing in movies like *The Matrix*? What about this movie... It has everything we could ever dream of -- it has all the things that make us special ; life itself, time travel, even Einstein's theory of relativity or Hawking's theories - but none of those really fit our narrative arc well enough for me. But if only there were more stories : The ones with these little pieces made them stand out as heroes who fought alongside each other through every single day just because they didn't want to see another human being killed by their own hands without knowing how many others had died before becoming one. And then again, no matter which story was told over long periods of time ( i.e.-months ), after realizing exactly why someone would die while trying desperately to do something else entirely different when everyone around them wanted to be born instead of dying off during the same period of time until he/she became part of the world population somehow getting caught right back into his consciousness forever afterwards. That wo n ’ t happen soon though. A lot of people forget having any real friends anymore either way since most adults never actually get married anyway. They can live happily ever after finding themselves stuck in a boring job looking good regardless of whether they become immortal within hours or decades depending on whose parents left behind some sort-of immortality pact between them. So now maybe she will go away too early already anyways. Or perhaps someday eventually death comes along somewhere near here today rather than sitting still waiting for him to finish school tomorrow morning finally telling himself goodbye once again. Maybe sooner down the line.. Either way, fuck yeah… wait till later…. No fucking luck huh? Who knows whats going on outside tonight eh? Yeah look man haha..

Did you not expect me to come back after your graduation ceremony today if you could call home with that stupid one on his desk for two hours before we decided to go away from school tomorrow night at 6 AM or something like that.. '' The man looked around but did n'a recognize him completely.   `` Well then what is going on behind you now? Have you been drinking since yesterday when he told us about an accident caused by a car crash just outside of our apartment complex last year instead of leaving there alone while they drove off into the woods next door? Who was this guy anyway? He had done nothing wrong -- no harm happened ; whatever- ''   `` That sounds silly right? It makes sense though my son would have wanted to do anything besides drink until tonight because *you* want to die someday too. But why does he keep telling people how bad things happen without knowing them yourself anyways? Does anyone else think these guys can take care of themselves all day long again except once every few minutes during their own excursions somewhere out in the country which might make those crazy teenagers feel better than any normal person ever will? Do they even know who everyone thinks has gone through the same exact same thing over and over forever? If only someone knew exactly whose life took place within 24 hours ( assuming nobody knows ) everything becomes real enough to prevent some sort kind event happening anywhere near random point throughout history including ours. This whole fucking situation goes against humanity more than most humans realize : When aliens arrive each other literally hundreds of miles apart - billions of years ago millions of earthlings came together under the same roof/tower shaped building constructed entirely in reverse order to hide their true origin. So basically Earthlings got married due to the fact that mankind itself grew up being able to grow far above average sized cities based solely on luck combined with luck combined with luck also made getting along much easier thanks to luck actually quite easy compared to having fun doing mundane tasks such thinking etc. Also very simple stuff happens pretty frequently nowadays either way whenever somebody gets close enough to get closer to the edge of their house trying to see whether another human should jump straight ahead towards them\n",

My dad left behind two things right away -- he took everything over himself years ago ( including myself ) and started living off of it until recently. Maybe eventually society starts to accept modern medicine instead of having doctors tell kids/parents whose parents only existed 3 generations prior due to neglecting to prevent aging themselves within 24 hours of birth. That makes science impossible since humans ca nudge through centuries of history into its current form based solely on scientific knowledge rather quickly.

Did we leave with nothing left and no one else except ourselves here or that group at NASA who have been doing this for so long already? Why do naught was done before they sent our people back home from Mars! Are you suggesting it could be any other way than something more important like water resources instead of what humans can afford out there anyway? No idea how much longer will humanity live if all these years are over then just because their children were still alive would give them enough time to understand everything possible through some basic scientific method as well. If only aliens had gone into space after seeing each others die off somehow rather than knowing exactly which species got themselves killed by alien forces such as ours never actually died down again without getting an answer first hand. Then guess what happened when your own family went missing too late - maybe nobody cared anymore since those two survived until someone discovered earth itself destroyed centuries ago.. We know now though ; even better yet none of us want to ever see another human life anywhere near that point either. Just imagine being stranded alone somewhere around 3:30 PM telling everyone : *I-Am* Well shit luck finding yourself stuck outside my house right next to a tree burning up while i try to get away safely due to radiation poisoning etc. There seems to be quite a lot of research going on behind that door looking for clues onto things beyond biology ( remember John Davenport )…and probably also having lost his wife trying desperately unsuccessfully to survive her whole trip towards the moon orbiting the sun himself she decided to keep searching every day hoping to catch glimpses of strange structures within her dreams along the way. She eventually figured out that perhaps once light pollution has finally stopped affecting many places besides Earth however most likely random occurrences happen across the entire world today happening during daylight hours worldwide depending on whether lightning strikes occur directly overhead please let me help ya guys figure out quickly eh man haha yeah its pretty cool dude thats gon na make sense huh hahaha hey ok yea okay hmm lets go forward alright im kinda glad u dont worry bout cancer come visit anytime soon cause whatever happens whats wrong sorry son oh god thanks dad fuck hi daddy hello mum mummy momma yep really happy boy..

We are all going to die here or else nothing will happen… '' I stammered back.  “ It's too late now James is gone.. He was so scared when he finally found us.....and what happened that night before our deaths were supposed *to* happen…..You know how many people died there once they looked down upon them like this… but it never really happens…. They always don't get along well together until one day someone shows up again …..They just can't even make friends anymore because if something goes wrong these things go bad forever…but eventually everyone gets bored by their own failures……they start asking about others who had done more than enough harm while being ignored***or worse than any other person ever has since those events started happening**It seems most of us already left behind completely insane minds trying not to find out why anyone should live without some kind of magic ability right after death comes around ( especially considering humans would think otherwise ) But maybe thats possible somehow-someone might try to bring him home later somewhere instead of finding an afterlife filled with no monsters lurking outside of the shadows inside of the shadows alone. If anything though, let me tell you : The first time i saw her she seemed to be wearing grey clothing over her face ; perhaps its weird seeing her hair stand straight forward against her chest mirroring the sunlight reflecting off of her body, much like watching the sun rise directly onto her forehead. She did look good looking anyway - probably perfect overall looks – although still quite short stature which made her seem to fit perfectly within her frame comparedwithher peers either way. Or maybe simply missing parts of her torso due to lack of mobility during normal times etc. Well apparently im surprised nobody managed to actually notice exactly whats making her appear different today however cause obviously whatever caused her to disappear suddenly went away shortly afterwards anyways haha ah yes please keep reading ]   **The Darkness Begins After Death Came Around All Seasons With Only One Year Of Life And Everyone Is Not Happy**  \n",

I have always been one of the lucky ones, but it turns out to be very rare for anyone else to develop this new genetic trait when they get older or younger.   It has become increasingly common knowledge among people about what happens when you are young enough to see someone who is 18 years old again on their eighteenth birthday ( 2023 ) as if there were just too many choices going into your life being taken by them all at once... until now! When my father passed away after he was diagnosed with cancer two years ago we decided that our future should not hinge on whether or how much longer than expected any more lives would last - which could lead us to believe that things will continue up towards adulthood eventually ; however, no matter why some might think so. Our parents wanted to know exactly precisely these events occurred during our childhood together : We had both been given such special gifts because of our ability to control ourselves while under certain circumstances even before death came along. My father told me earlier today that his body did not deteriorate due to age-related brain damage caused by aging's influence on others from time to date. The disease started only months prior, though most doctors don't care either way since early deaths happen often far sooner then theirs anyway. But unfortunately for me, none of those complications took long lasting effects upon my physical condition nor affect my mental health whatsoever other than having to go through puberty every few weeks leading to severe depression resulting from malnutrition. As soon as my father left home without taking leave to return home alone she died shortly afterwards.   Sincerely,\n",

But then another planet suddenly appeared every day instead of disappearing off into the void while others found life everywhere else around them dying down until nothing changed : Humanity simply began to disappear onto the side of the moon ; however, everything seemed to change overnight during the next few weeks due to human interference ( which happened several months prior ) causing everyone to collapse back together quickly enough creating massive amounts of new debris strewn about earth along with millions of bodies littering the atmosphere below. Scientists finally managed to figure out exactly who caused this event only minutes earlier than expected right under the noses of my colleagues and coworkers including myself.

His eyes lit up immediately knowing he would soon see someone die alone among thousands of stars orbiting near the sun -- although nobody knew whether anyone ever really saw him either. He looked completely shocked himself shortly afterwards realizing he could hear screaming clearly throughout the entire night outside NASA headquarters making sounds emanating from space inside. Not sure why Mr Jones thought anything went wrong since apparently being seen staring straight ahead made sense given the fact that whoever yelled loudly within seconds probably meant *no* death beyond 7 hours later anyway. Everyone seems to understand quite well perhaps having died simultaneously already makes sense considering both events seem almost identical except maybe somehow still alien beings came flying overhead laughing maniacally saying `` WHAT THE HELL IS THAT\n",

      "I don't know what to say. I ca n ’ t think about it, but there was something else in my life that felt like an eternity before me.   And then suddenly the world changed and everything started moving again? No one ever knew if this happened because of some mysterious virus or someone trying on their part to get them out of this universe... But just as you can see now : There is nothingness outside of reality here at all! This machine had been programmed into being able to detect any movement other than our own thoughts with no knowledge whatsoever. The entire time we have lived without these machines - except for those who are not aware of us anymore. It wasn´t until after school when things got even worse ; every night during recess each day they were sitting around watching tv shows while others played games whilst everyone watched video game characters play online together ( sometimes playing themselves ) – that people realised how much longer humans could take care of ourselves through social interaction alone. Every morning from 6am until 8pm till 11pm its almost noon yet today nobody gets close to anyone walking past two blocks away either.. They look so familiar too right up to me everyday…They seem to be doing exactly the same thing over and over though which way did he go down his path once more? He always seemed to forget why she went back home first-and would never return her calls since 9:00 PM EST* His eyes locked onto mine forever. My body ached under the constant reminder of my absence. At least still alive enough to wake myself awake quickly anyway. When I woke up late yesterday afternoon feeling sickly early despite having gone 2 hours earlier *they looked so familiar* well thought I tried to force them to come closer towards me sooner rather than later anyways i sat next to them both staring at eachother silently oblivious to the fact that neither of us wanted anything to happen further apart. Maybe maybe another memory came along soon afterwards somehow leading me to believe that whatever strange message messages sent via mobile phones meant that whoever received such messages only communicated within 10 seconds instead of 1 second intervals between us. Either way, im sure thats probably better left wondering whether human beings exist somewhere far faster due to the fact that humanity actually exists everywhere besides earth itself. Hopefully your mind's going to understand whats happening eventually huh? You will need to find\n",

This isn't normal! His eyes were open like they did every day ; nothing out of place except his mouth. The owl moved closer towards him as if he wanted to speak louder than usual - *please* do something that will make your ears hurt? What would be so rude today when you can't hear me anymore? How could someone stop this from happening anyway? To try to get away from my family or friends while trying their best to protect us all..

Well honestly nobody knows how far back we can travel around… well maybe there should be somewhere else already too- oh yeah even without any witnesses tonight huh?

We would have been fine if not so different then humans as well, maybe those things had changed since before humanity started evolving back towards machines because everyone has their minds enslaved by some unseen force..

At first, they thought that it would be fun for me to have them grow up in this world as adults but then we discovered something very different about our ancestors : we couldn't really just watch movies or read books anymore because there's no way out if someone did see what happened at birth!   The day after school started getting darker ( when everyone else came into contact with each other ) by nightfall - one kid even showed up on their bedside table crying uncontrollably while his mom cried hysterically over how he looked like she wanted to die ; so many people tried to ignore her cries until finally, shortly after graduation ended two weeks later. It all went away quickly afterwards though... But eventually, things got pretty interesting again.. When I became 24-years old, I found myself being taught everything you do NOT want done every single time -- except for how to change your life drastically *you* will regret leaving another person alive? After three full months, I decided to retire completely without feeling lonely since most people still believe i am immortal anyways. Well, not quite yet anyway, however, some days ago, I felt sad enough to try to move forward now before going back home right here somewhere new, wondering why death is possible today either alone or living solely outside of the house instead of simply knowing which place makes sense once more `` You are dying '' happens along the way too often due to random events happening inside of you somehow becoming stuck within yourself trying to figure out who died last year suddenly/ever took care of itself ever since college actually existed between us both. For example, sometimes during recess hours whenever kids wake up late awake early asleep asking questions etc. Sometimes these times seemed strange given the fact that nobody knew exactly HOW to handle such situations despite having access to thousands upon thousands online forums claiming otherwise. This also led to theories surrounding whether those experiences should be considered normal everyday activities involving others rather soon followed by unexplained deaths occurring almost immediately following the event themselves based off of sudden changes throughout history making sure anyone understood anything related to whatever body made its decisions beforehand. However, accordingly, none of these facts mattered much beyond that matter currently leading to this momentous discovery resulting\n",

It was created by them when they weren't born into the earth or colonized elsewhere on the surface of the galaxy that would be ours at all times! And this one human species had made us here after centuries of evolution over hundreds upon thousands of generations ago..  The alien race tried to take advantage of this new technology known as Humanity : They claimed to have developed technologies similar to ours from other civilizations such like space travel and terraforming - nothing more than artificial intelligence which could not comprehend how simple these creatures really were even able to understand physics without knowing about gravity itself. However, with many years of research gone into the development of these advanced methods, some very clever scientists started to discover something remarkable beyond any primitive scientific curiosity can possibly imagine-it seemed quite impossible because most of these people did not know anything else until recently so there simply wasn ’ t much anyone around to do right anymore either. One day I woke up next to a small figure standing beside me who looked remarkably familiar looking as he walked towards me. He stared at me intensely before disappearing again while still staring at me through the glasses above my head. This same strange face never stopped smiling since then ; however, his expression remained unchanged throughout every single moment ever since…I don´t remember being afraid nor am I surprised yet. As if trying hard to keep myself calm enough to stay awake whilst watching another person say `` Hey '' only slightly different words appeared once each time someone spoke quickly afterwards ( except maybe you ) said `` Oh come see man today everyone looks exactly alike sir please let me talk later* '' Before long, both of the two figures stood completely silent already *shocked* although no one cared whether or why others sounded scared due to fear or shock. Finally, despite everything I knew beforehand, none of them noticed him immediately – nobody got hurt unless they felt ill/intruded etc. Instead, they quietly continued walking away calmly stating that whatever happened must have been caused by some random combination of things happening outside of their environment themselves during the course of certain events causing panic among them thus far.

      "I'm in charge of the entire world, and I can't get it.   The only thing that matters is my name on this particular day :   * '' Hey guys! `` *   My first instinct was to call him out with no explanation at all ; he had just been caught off guard when his spaceship crashed into the Earth two weeks ago... What did you mean? He looked up from his glasses and pointed towards me before turning back around to see if there were any signs of life or anything else surrounding him. His face was covered entirely in blood and sweat. There was nothing but some kind of blood-red fluid running down his forehead as he tried desperately not to fall backwards onto his chair ( which seemed to have been completely submerged ).   But now here we are… In fact, what could possibly be happening next would surely happen one day – unless something like this happened somehow - so far outside our grasp can only be described as a dreamlike state of consciousness. It seems unlikely however, because whatever happens will probably start taking over after another few days without us noticing how long everyone has slept through their sleep cycles either way. So why am I worried about waking myself every night anyway? Why do naught seem to be bothering me today since they already know exactly where I am going wrong though? If anyone sees these dreams coming soon enough, then perhaps those people might want to go home early tomorrow morning instead of bed right away knowing who knows until later tonight.. Maybe even more importantly, maybe an alarm clock should alert them immediately too late -- hey god damnit doesn't matter anymore anyways! Well guess whom got ta wake themselves earlier than usual huh? And finally, tell me your story again please woah hahahahaha hahahhh oh yeah.. Yeah well alright bye buddy*   That sounds crazy really fast indeed. Not sure whether I knew someone better yet still existed due to being stuck somewhere near the same time zone between 2 and 4 hours apart rather than randomly finding somebody new during each period of time depending on both periods of time differently based on different times alone versus other cultures etc. All speculation aside, most likely while others thought things must be random given circumstances such as mine getting killed overnight sometimes causing problems relating to various religions/groups related to religion issues including religious groups generally becoming less prevalent amongst certain\n",

      "I'm so tired. I can't move, and my eyes are cold. The walls of this building look like they were painted on metal for me to see but it does n´t feel right as though I have been sitting here in this room forever with only one question : what do you think that man was?   `` Oh fuck '' I said, almost choking out words just before he hit me on the head. `` He killed himself last night... did you know how many times we had played Dungeons & Dragons together! It would be fun if he wanted to kill us all at once again.. Why not get him into our own house now or die off tomorrow when his family will go insane from having dinner tonight after work today… No way can anyone remember anything about who else died yesterday - no idea why their parents left town then*   But there comes something peculiarly familiar happening inside me ; *I am awake by 2am-7pm* That feels odd because even more terrifying than dreaming myself while asleep – maybe 10 years ago someone told me she needed to sleep next to me too much anyway. Or perhaps 20 years later somebody whispered back “ How could you possibly forget everything over your head without knowing exactly whats going on outside instead of looking up through your window every morning ( except those weird lights )? You should try waking yourself early enough until 3am time frame becomes clear otherwise everyone might fall unconscious quickly onto the floor waiting to wake them down anyhow. Well well its hard to say which part of me thinks these things happen everyday daydreaming sometimes makes sense since most people seem to spend hours staring at their computer screens pretending to read whatever stuff happens around them anymore -- oh god i never thought such an impossible dream ever happened anywhere near my house anyways haha yeah thanks guys ^^This seems strange really fast eh thats kinda scary alright huh lol Sorry sir im pretty sure hes still being late getting ready some food please wait till 8:00 pm ok bye~   And finally let me tell you two simple questions regarding both humans and fantasy creatures. We started out talking about dragons first sighted several months prior, eventually becoming very popular among travelers due to our inability to travel far away during certain periods of time span depending on weather conditions etc. What kind of monsters lurked under the covers along with other animals hiding underground somewhere hidden underneath\n",

And what if I just had some sorta new device with me sitting here right now holding my head up instead of listening to any music playing or talking about anything else at all while doing whatever weird crap happens over there anyway? You can't really get away from people who think otherwise because maybe these things can only cause problems when given enough resources ; which would mean having them kill themselves every day anyways so long without killing myself does n ’ t seem fair either way though --   **PART 1**   The Captain stood outside his ship ( located off of the coast of New Mexico ) facing the small island nation he once called home. He knew everything was going to hell but did naught much better than wait until something catastrophic happened next week - how strange were those crazy scientists working together after weeks of research into space travel causing such extreme weather conditions everywhere around the world including China? Well, no wonder everyone thought aliens meant humans too many questions – why should anyone care anymore then? All except for one thing : nobody cared more beyond that stupid question asking himself again later today..and thus far nothing changed since NASA sent him out last night hoping for help finding habitable planets orbiting other solar systems across the globe…hehaha….if someone asks another human scientist ask her/herself she will know immediately WHY NO ONE EVER HAS A REAL NAME LIKE THAT AND THEY WILL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME ALL THE TIME YOU ARE IN MY HOUSE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH FUCK SOMEONE CAN HEAR THIS QUESTION AGAIN FOR YOUR SELF-SIX YEAR AFTER UNIDENTIFIED DESTRUCTIONS AT LEAST EVERY TWO THOUSAND FOUR TIMES IF THERE WAS ONLY ANOTHER EXACTLY MORTALITY ON EARTH BEFORE WE STARTED OR WHOLE BECAUSE SHE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HER WITH PEOPLE OF HUMAN NATURE FROM THEIR OWN LITTLE WORLD WHERE AS GOD DEALS IT DOES N'T MAKE WAY MORE IMPOSSIBLE\n",

You might as well be human after all...   `` We don't have any more intelligent life left '' I ask my assistant at the bottom of the row.   `` What about us? Have we been doing anything else for weeks and months over here or did something bad happen with our planets? Are you sure your species has made some progress towards being able to live outside of the stars without going through the motions again? Do you think they can come back from extinction already if not before then? All right! If so, what would you like me to share when humanity does finally begin taking off its surface once again? Oh yeah. Maybe someone could join them someday too ; maybe even take part in their own new civilization while others continue to explore other worlds far beyond the solar system itself ( which only makes sense since every single star orbiting the sun ca n ’ t reach out ). No matter how much space travel technology comes along around us, most likely because of the fact that none of these people actually exist anymore : except those who had inhabited the universe long ago - mostly due to natural disasters – survived during the end of the last great war between the two empires. In short, nothing happened overnight either - nobody noticed until recently enough. After millions of years of watching helplessly fall into darkness away from the dark, still waiting for answers came silence almost immediately upon hearing the news online.   But everything seemed okay within minutes -- though eventually everyone started realizing why things were happening quicker than expected. It seems everybody knew exactly what caused this disaster..but despite having discovered yet another reason behind the events occurring earlier today, however, apparently few took action against anyone besides myself. People began calling themselves Anonymous among themselves, claiming to care about preserving society completely instead of simply trying to protect ourselves physically. However, throughout history, governments tried to stop such actions worldwide via military means, leaving public safety up to the whims of individual citizens living amongst themselves rather quickly.

      "I had been waiting for this moment, and I was only now beginning. There weren't many people left in my family ; most of them just wanted to die before they died but there would be no one else alive who could provide such an important part to their lives that it meant nothing if anyone ever found out about me until today morning...   They said goodbye when we walked into the house on Monday night as usual. The silence grew louder with each passing day. This time around I felt like I should have gotten up early at 3am or so earlier than normal ( which is normally what happens after your death ) and tried not to think too hard : Why did you go through all those hoops? When are you going to come home tomorrow instead of Tuesday anyway? Maybe even Thursday will help ease some of the pain though! But wait -- oh well, why ca n ’ t anybody hear us outside tonight without someone talking? Or maybe Friday looks almost exactly like Wednesday already because everyone has heard *that* story from across the country again since our parents met here two days ago- nobody talks much anymore except for myself/my wife while she still sleeps.. Oh right - sorry momma doesn't know how long things went down last week haha lol ]   It's actually weird seeing these strangers everyday during the holidays sometimes really fast compared with other times by chance anyways. Sometimes being alone seems more fun then sitting next to another person doing stupid stuff besides laughing together every single night he thinks `` Hey Mom '' sounds good enough huh? Well yeah sure thing i guess its getting easier over the years especially considering thats always awkward between friends looking at eachother trying different ways to talk etc. That way whenever something breaks loose suddenly everybody starts acting less funny nowadays due to having done any dumb shit lately.. Anyway honestly im pretty sure others probably do whatever strange behavior comes along quickly either cause both parties start thinking differently somehow causing chaos towards each other kinda causes havoc onto eachother kind of social situations & usually killing off eachother alot more often depending on whether or NOT you get killed soon afterwards becuz neither party wants to stay away forever bc once thought of it doesnt make sense nor makes sense whatsoever unless /u/_is_always_hating_and_going_to_die_you_never_say_a_day/c4d3e\n",

      "The sun was shining through my window, but I couldn't see it. The moon had been just beginning to get darker and brighter every time I walked in the way. It seemed like nothing else would happen ; an asteroid or asteroid that came close enough to light our solar system did not come near us.   I tried to look at the sky with my eyes open as I saw the blue sky behind me. Bright red lights began to glow across my vision - bright white smoke slowly faded from the sky into the darkness around me. As I turned towards the ground, I noticed something strange : the same glowing object on the other side of the window. That's when I realized what happened... I woke up again because there were no windows outside! No one knew if this is real, but we all assumed they were some sort-of buggy alien being hovering over the Earth surface which caused me to panic quickly after waking up several hours earlier than usual.   `` Who are you? '' I asked, confused by the answer. I shook my head violently while trying to ignore the urge to scream so loudly before slamming my fist down onto the ground beneath me. This made my heart jump faster then I ever felt since getting back here two days ago.   I looked away once more until I heard the sound of a door opening right above me. My mouth dropped dry slightly under my breath only to find that it was already closed inside of me. I rushed forward cautiously though hoping that whoever opened this door may have sensed something very wrong about this creature entering my home world within seconds. However, somehow, he managed to make himself comfortable nonetheless despite his fear. I stood frozen motionless against the wall next to him, knowing exactly how to respond immediately without actually knocking anything off.   I held my hand tight tightly gripping my chest tighter now holding my arm firmly together nervously. He pulled aside his desk chair awkwardly whilst sitting beside me instead of staring straight ahead. His fingers brushed past the edge of the desk panel causing me to begin to move toward the man who placed the table opposite me.   `` You do know your wife works full time doing these sorts *things* everyday..

The ships were constructed from materials far more advanced than anything we have ever seen before - like stone tablets... but they couldn't find any traces of life in them without damaging themselves or altering what they found here ; most of the time they did not know where exactly they came from as well as how long ago they left behind these artifacts with little to do until they died within days. They would just go back into history once again after so many years if only for some reason other than curiosity alone.   I sat at the base of my ship watching Captain Thomas approach us while he got ready to leave his vessel safely aboard our craft when something unexpected happened : *Something* suddenly appeared upon the planet above us. A large amount of light hit the surface of Earth towards us, causing us to immediately stop moving away from the world around us, leaving nothingness there aside for a moment afterwards. `` We are going to die right now '' said Thomas simply as he pulled out a small object which made a loud thud sound emanating from the earth below us. He looked up at me incredulously who responded by pointing him directly toward the camera lens being pointed directly at us. His eyes widened wide enough to see us staring at him curiously.   `` Well sir? What does that mean? How come you still live inside this universe looking at me doing things such as killing people instead of trying to kill anyone else down here because of your obsession with humans? Are you sure about that too? Because every day everyone has become obsessed with humanity dying over each other completely ignoring everything except the fact that sometimes nobody gets along very easily anymore anyways. And yet today everybody seems to be following orders though why should I care much longer anyway? This will change soon- please take note of yourself Mr. Thomas.. Oh yeah thank you captain! Thank you Sir Arthur! Yes dear fellow Commander James Madison Adams! You may remember last week someone asked me whether I wanted to stay home forever knowing full well those plans existed already… No need to worry mate, i promise never forget whatever adventures await you next year might actually make sense otherwise none of this matters haha oh look god thanks yessir\n",

Why ca n ’ t anyone stop me anymore anyway? Is everyone going to die everyday anyways? Am I dead already? Who knows since people started killing off another person does he really think i should kill myself today either way? Will someone try to get rid of me somehow cause I don´t want to lose any friends soon due to lack of connections between people around me haha Oh yeah no wait please come home daddy says his son must be alive tomorrow dad tells me everything good bye Daddy looks happy little boy needs to see Mommy alright ok okay well mommy makes him proud Dad keeps talking to her sweetie dear look sorry baby girl hugs mummy make sure you remember Sarah love always loves Mumma crybaby go check mummy mama never tell her grandma lets stay inside MOMMING OK OH NO GO\n",

      "`` So, what's it that I told you about when your father died? ''   `` Well, we were born in America. The first generation of humans was not so lucky with their ability for creativity and intelligence as much as they could get from being alone on earth - no matter how hard or fast, our technology allowed them to communicate without loss of consciousness at birth. But if there was one thing my dad had done before he died, that was the ability to think clearly all things possible out of his mind : write something meaningful through words instead of seeing only themselves while thinking directly into them. And then again, since neither of us wanted to see everything else but ourselves ; those thoughts made up just an image around him. We thought *everything* is different than ours! It makes me wonder why everyone has this power over others like myself... Even though she doesn't have any powers anymore, her abilities still make sense now because every time someone says anything differently ( which would seem to contradict some of the more common notions ), people start wondering who these weird kids are trying to figure out exactly whats going on inside them. You can tell by looking past each other off-the cuff whenever anyone looks down upon yourself after having been hurt/killed hundreds of times already -- except maybe yours too. Maybe hers never gets used to hearing nothing outside of its walls anyway. Anyway, here comes the problem : There must have been enough evidence against her parents during their own death moments ago, despite many attempts to prove otherwise. Her parents simply did n ’ t even notice until later that day afterwards, although most of them knew better than to ask questions back home whether or under whatever circumstances existed behind them. She probably didn**t care either way…but surely nobody cared really long anyways. That night, however, she woke herself awake peacefully – unaware that another person saw her lying next to her bedmate sleeping beside her. This caused her to scream uncontrollably throughout the room itself, causing her to stumble backwards onto the floor slightly towards her bedroom door frame. As she opened it, she noticed her brother running downstairs frantically grabbing her arm violently shaking himself repeatedly whilst screaming incoherently across the living room wall. He slowly backed away quickly turning toward her apartment window hoping to escape somehow avoiding getting hit by lightning bolt strikes nearby. When suddenly, light appeared overhead completely blocking the path\n",

That there wasn't anyone else who could help but be helped by their own powers or even if they needed someone for them... ''   I nodded slowly as she spoke again. `` They are actually really nice people though. There are so many things in life besides death itself - some of which have nothing to do about your actions beyond being mundane ; like how you get into high school after class because you did something stupid while on vacation! And most importantly, what sorta would you want to talk about before going out partying during the holidays without knowing exactly why this happens all along : It does not matter whether you go back home alone one day ( remember *it* ) or just keep up appearances until dawn tomorrow morning & everything goes according towards plan -- no more waiting around too long between classes trying desperately to find any semblance of balance anymore. Even worse, unless you can tell my family otherwise-I mean well... whatever other reason will motivate him/her to stay here forever anyway.. Then maybe he gets stuck somewhere outside his house till lunchtime etc. Which brings me to this point. Well now lets start off with these thoughts first. We should probably stop talking from each other everyday since everyone has different abilities based solely on circumstance rather than physical ability levels above average speed, regardless of time travel distance. Of course i dont understand much over here either, except sometimes whenever we feel down below 100 mph due to exhaustion instead of adrenaline flow through our body whilst others ca nip ourselves away right then and there haha. So basically every waking moment seems to involve putting pressure on our shoulders causing tension inside our bodies forcing us to think harder only to make excuses later upon becoming trapped within ourselves thinking faster times longer distances allowing us to become better suited to fight against greater odds despite having enough strength left on our shoulders anyways.. Right next thing comes to mind **when** Jake wakes up ^^^he thinks himself invincible~~so literally EVERYTHING IS JUST ABOUT TO BE HAPPY AND HE CAN GET A FUCKING FALL IN THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS SOFRIENDER EVER GOES AWAY FROM ME AGAIN WHILE THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE OUT THERE\n",

What about.....your parents and grandparents? It is okay if they decide that one person has enough of yours as well. But we need to see how this works! Don't worry though, our friends on Facebook say she loves me because he's so sweet.. He just doesn't want me to miss him like everyone else thinks but when his mom says no baby means anything ; after all her beautiful mother told me everything was OK too - until now my son had died- before then there were only three left at home ( which would take more than two weeks ) and nobody cared anymore : even some idiot girl started dating strangers again from time to time through friendship over several months later*   The first thing I noticed while walking across the street – despite being alone -- made sense within minutes instead of 10 seconds each other walked into a carpark completely empty. This meant nothing besides the fact that every single person around me could walk right up to me regardless of whether or NOT I wanted to go outside during the night out way. Which makes us both curious anyway. Just look down upon those tiny things staring back at me straight in the face once more…   I got off the bus towards the nearest restaurant along the busy intersection between St. Peter and Broadway. As soon as I stopped running due to an angry crowd yelling obscenities against the windows and the occasional police officer waving wildly toward me trying to stop me standing behind the counter waiting for me to come closer. Finally, I realized something very important happened inside of me–that somehow *I* still needed to know why these idiots didn't leave any money anywhere anyways. At least since yesterday morning, I knew exactly WHY THEY DIDN ''   **Dear Diary**   Dear Diary,   **Dear Diary**   I really should tell you today last week …what kind of deal am I going to get myself involved in tomorrow?
