      "The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time . Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings . His eyes fluttered . Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor , contorting his aching body into a cross legged position . Last night was bad . He gathered that . His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories . He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort .  He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was . His investigation was n't entirely fruitless , he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka . It was cheap but would definitely get the job done . Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up .  There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself . It was a game he 'd play with himself , glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back . If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman , or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling .  His face was portly and unshaven , in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard . His stomach was round but firm , like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated . The hair was long and unruly , receding far into the past . But his eyes were the giveaway . Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity . It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger . Still sharp enough to cut .  `` DiCaprio . '' The curse rasped out of him in a choke . After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there . Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there . He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done , but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money . Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him .  Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor .  His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room .   The window was smashed . He looked at the bottle , confused . No , he had n't done that . At least not with the vodka . He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth .   The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place . What the fuck happened last night ?\n",
      "It was a long tiring day as usual . I leaned on my sofa throwing my bag on to the near by table . Slowly dozed off to sleep . My imaginations rushed in , I could literally feel my dream and it was of none other than an episode which caught my attention today . Me and one of my colleague were having lunch and a small boy standing outside the canteen was cleaning the window panes , he was hardly 10 . Full greased head to foot , filthy clothes , torn shoes but with a cherry red lips and a droopy eyes filled with all innocence he could gather within it .  It was raining and he was shivering after a while . He sat loopy near the window base facing me . I was having coffee then . As we started staring at each other I felt difficulty in drinking my coffee . It was nothing but me sitting comfortably inside the cafe warm and the boy now half drenched killed me within . I could n't read any thing from his face that he is not liking what he is going through . I called him and offered him a tea . Gladly he accepted it ! I asked dont you feel cold , he told no I feel close to nature . I was so taken by the love and spirit he had within and his love for nature , the smallest things which I could n't realize which he made me feel was aw inspiring . I wish I had a mouse with me to take of the poverty in his life with a click , and fill his childhood with all the beautiful things he deserve .  And soon i realized this was a beautiful dream , a dream that i would love it to come true .   Daffodils\n"
