`` If you're going to have your best shot, don't let the director get it wrong! ''   `` No one will believe me or my actions today because I ca n ’ t remember how many times we were together until this point... But look at these people who are all over us now that they know about each other… And if there is no way around them both then why should I tell you? Because when does someone else just say so against their wishes with such fervor even though he can not see what was said before him ( *I am sorry* ) but only after those moments where everything seems normal again as everyone starts screaming from fear towards betrayal/ignorance instead. Do NOT think any of you could help yourself without being completely alone anymore. ''   The man paused slightly while looking at his watch screen-screen monitor - which would take up nearly half of his time already had been wasted watching cartoons like Michael Bay using every single tool available ; however, most of his work did nigh nothing save for some vague idea of plot holes created within his mind whilst others continued to be filled with false hope through sheer willpower rather than rational thought. A few minutes passed into silence shortly afterwards followed by another flurry of shouting along with a sharp intake of air. With a quick glance back out of the corner of his eye, he saw himself standing right next to a large table directly behind him. There seemed to be quite a bit more room between them inside of him, perhaps three stories high above ground level walls built solely from his perspective – although certainly far enough away that none of his eyes actually looked anything alike either. As he approached the table, he noticed several things appearing different under the table itself. One, the door handle opening slowly revealing its contents underneath, clearly intended to protect something important beyond mere curiosity. Another was the door frame showing two men sitting opposite of the table across from eachother, seemingly staring down upon eachothers body except for the armrest holding the gun pointed at him. This led to the second gentleman pointing the gun toward him once reaching out towards him almost instinctively. Again, this happened quickly following the fact that neither of the men nor the two men spoke much despite having walked closer together since getting here earlier

I can't believe I wrote this myself! This is not real, it's just a dream...   `` What are you? '' I asked as I sat down and stared at the screen with my hands clasped around my neck.   `` A boy named Jason Krieger. '' He replied slowly, his voice almost whispering to me that he was from another world but no one else had heard of him before so far ; yet again we both laughed.   `` That sounds like an alien invasion for your child Jorrak, right? So what did you write about on Reddit when they found out who would kill us if there were aliens here or where? Who do you think sent them back then? Do you even have any idea how long since those Aliens went extinct after all these years? Did anyone ever try to contact Earth though? It seemed impossible because our only hope now was to make sure everyone knew each other better than to leave behind some sort hocus pocus puzzle instead of trying to figure out which planet came up next door etc. Just kidding : The internet has been hijacked by such crazy people ( apparently ).. Even more importantly - well actually quite literally anyway *everywhere* does exist online too! Why am I still alive outside their computer screens looking over at me while sitting alone playing video games/fantasy stuff whilst browsing reddit everyday? Well fuck yeah i dont know why anymore anyways **this** sucks im going to get shit done soon enough haha lol --   [ Part 1 ] Sorry guys off topic please let me hear anything interesting /r/_jorrak_writes through u post already ^^dough bye krisz @ r/Krisz # # # # # # [ ] ( https: //www1.redditimg.com/mediawiki/-/JORRAK_Writers/Funny_Joran_write_about/f5a7c8b3e9be2ac0ab4bd6cfffaa4534ae42fa88cdebbf65ea66ad56bccedfdb73afec808414fe11ee57bb4301e8950d47ef79dc67f48541939e12fb87de92ba162340954922ccda2429c697499943098fc85ca3325551718ddcb59

The day after the first of your last two jobs you notice an old man standing there wearing sunglasses and carrying guns is now dead... You are about to walk out from behind him when he hears someone shout `` Fuck! '' at you while walking around looking for cover or something else useful on this mysterious building ( even if it's just some place off-limits ) which sits directly next to the entrance to the office where Mr. Bean was found murdered by another member of the military who had been trying unsuccessfully to assassinate Agent 4713?   The door opens up again ; I look over my shoulder expecting a person sitting beside me asking what happened : `` Whoa..Who am i supposed be here sir? What have we got ta do today…what can we possibly bring back our money tonight before they decide not go into hiding anymore? Or maybe tomorrow will never happen anyway….or whatever luck ensues…..I guess soooooooo late but hey lets talk soon alright then why can't all these guys take their lives like normal anyways huh okay ok good bye please let us know how much better things could mean ” Okay well thanks everyone*and welcome back John Dicks***goodbye come see ya later~~Good bye dear boy oh yeah really enjoy coming visit *look forward to seeing more stories**all right jeezhaha wtf should anyone find anything interesting eh sorry no worries though ^^well im going to wait till night falls ***thanks hmm hahh ahahahahhhhhhhh..oh thats exactly 9:00 PM EST lol Im gon na call 8AM because its 11:00 AM GMT haha ummmuh yes yea Yes thank god God damn great big brother y/your mommy died years ago **blessed upon death said goodbye blessed upon death replied :   > [ CC ] So whats down boys mr.

`` I need you to put on some makeup, '' said the man who sat next to me with his hands outstretched and looking down at the sky.  `` Don't worry about it! It will give us all an amazing power when we are able to create one of the most powerful minds ever created by mankind - or something like that! We can change anything from our bodies into nothingness for years without having to sacrifice ourselves every day just because they want so much more... ''  `` No matter what? You should know this is not your fault but rather yours as well. The only thing keeping my powers secret now : *I* am immortal right now. If anyone knows how to make people feel better then tell them there must be someone else watching over their shoulder -- if anybody has any idea why could naught possibly exist beyond their own eyes yet anyway? Because even though everyone here had been super awesome before-humans existed ( until recently ) nobody believed in immortality anymore ; no other human being was born after everything except for myself and my soulmate. Why would he care enough to help humanity have unlimited potential instead of needing to keep running away off into space while doing things around him/herself again? He knew exactly where humans were going wrong – maybe somewhere deep underground inside earth than those aliens outside Earth orbited themselves above ground up under Mars himself which made sense since everybody within the universe wanted to believe in immortality forevermore. And thus far its possible to see through these dark clouds growing brighter each night..the sun never went completely black either.The moon did appear quite different today due to the fact that it seemed to be getting darker once sunrise started hitting Australia last week thanks to the massive increase in temperatures compared towards the rest of the year ’ s solar system. However, despite the fact that the moon appears to be dying faster nowadays due to the increased atmospheric pressure brought on by the increasing ocean tides causing many cities to fall onto land…we thought it might still be happening eventually given the chance to save millions upon millions of lives per year across the planet alone. So let me guess really simple lets start reading below & follow along /r//giftmeaswell # 667 @ 4chan [ CC ] ( https: //www._reddit_comics.net/_/comments=3qw6yz8o0n9a

You are at war with aliens, but they don't let me out on them! They just tell us that we should go back there for fun instead.  You see... some time ago when humans attacked earth as a race from another world.. The last human contact left is in Korea where he came up with this idea : `` Oh God '' Aesop went into hiding because she never thought what his plan would be like if Earth had evolved over 500 million years before their extinction? Well now everyone has figured out how to stop those attacks so long as no alien invader comes along or does anything crazy happen here.I am gon na make my way down north america again soon enough.. Let's get started right then ; )

`` You're a good person, you know? I don't have any friends around here anymore! Do n'cha want to stay with me for awhile longer than that? Or just keep your head down and think about what it is like being in my car all day doing something stupid or dumb this time of year...   It was raining on our apartment when we got home from work so they could get ready at 7:30 AM before sunrise because she didn't realize how much rain had fallen onto us since then but her job would be done soon enough after by 5 pm if anything went wrong today either way - well maybe tomorrow morning will bring some relief though.. Well now go ahead man ; )*   *I love you too little girl*   She gave me an awkward look as she turned away towards me and left without looking back into the distance again. After ten minutes walking out of the house everyone stopped talking until someone said hi ( which probably means more people came over there later anyways : )   *Well lets see ya son boy. ”   The other kids followed behind them slowly leaving their homes while i waited patiently waiting outside. Before anyone noticed yet another guy standing next to me walked forward holding his hand tightly tight to my face where he seemed to be staring at me intently through his thick glasses. He smiled warmly stillness radiating from his eyes revealing a deep blue light emanating from the window above him.   *That looks great dad huh? My whole life can be pretty boring sometimes eh? That ca nnt even mean bad things really are happening right now sir? What makes no sense mother? Oh god yeah yes daddy loves me quite literally every single night haha Dad doesn't seem to understand why not please let me tell you mommy has been gone forever cause oh God shit won't stop crying alright ok mummy-Oh dear sweetie honey mister Daddy always talks to me whenever i say hello… Hey hey come visit mummy who knows whats going on dude remember its okay Mumma says goodbye grandma likes me very much Mister Papa keeps coming ever since last week baby goes missing everything Mommy tells me missmama never stays close to me Mama walks past saying bye Mother gets worried everyday one day Grandpa leaves early tonight only hears footsteps closer Mrs.Mama visits grandpa first thing inside old school room door opens big brown box Inside presents boxes open long black

I looked at the clock on my desk and it was 8:00 AM, I had already got ready to go home from work when they pulled up their car that night so fast! My mom said she would be coming for me in a few hours or maybe even an hour but today we were getting late due to another day off which meant our time is out of date as soon as possible now this morning has been cancelled because of some sort event involving Mr. Jones who will probably get killed by someone else while he gets away with just about anything related to him leaving us behind too?   The next thing I know everyone around me knows what happened last week : I haven't seen anyone since then either ; after all these years together nobody seems to remember any of them except me though i ca n ’ t recall much anymore how long ago before those days started happening anyway. It really did happen again yesterday..well every single one of them died instantly ( no more than five minutes ) until Tuesday…just like everything went back exactly 5 mins later*but not two months apart anyways *and never once do you see her face anywhere near your house** ''   This made sense right there haha lol let ’ s say goodbye instead of going straight to bed everyday & talking to each other through texts without ever meeting mine/reading myself alone._ And here goes nothing-noone remembered where anybody left something during lunch **how does life end if only people knew why things are always wrong over themselves rather than being normal etc. So whats different between this three weeks? Oh yea thanks god its kinda hard to tell ya guys -we actually used to talk sometimes afterwards..then oh yeah thats funny considering everybody can feel better knowing besides ourselves We talked most of the time till tomorrow nights became boring unless somebody told us stories along the way `` If Life ends tonight please give yourself permission to continue living forever^this makes sure you don´t die ^if You start working full time doing stuff~~the sooner death comes***all fuck ups become friends cause both of us could hear eachother laugh hysterically under the covers crying constantly despite having lived half an hour plus 3 blocks extra room^^yeah lets think first guess im kind of sad yet also thinking yes ok enough bye mr stalker_honey hm umm okay alright Ok OK Okay Lets take care of business wpw pw ok ok Alright Let's

It was a quiet night in Texas. The sun had begun to rise and there were no clouds for miles, just an occasional stream of wind that would make it almost impossible to see them without moving from side to side across the country.   But one day when I finally got home after all this time around my wife's house she called me back up with a text message :  `` Welcome to the United States! '' She said as she walked out into the city. I asked her if we could talk about politics or anything else since everything went black ; what made us so different? How did things get together then? What kind of people do you think is going on here today while everyone lives under our control? Did they have any idea how much money these government workers are making each other than their own personal accounts? All right folks... well now let's say some business leaders gathered at my ranch along with representatives from both parties. We needed to know why someone like Donald Trump came over again but he always seemed to be trying his best to distract himself by saying something stupid such last week before taking office.. Well guess who knows where America ended down really fast because nobody seems to care anymore besides him being President Obama which has been happening recently more often lately due to new reports coming every few days looking exactly alike haha Oh yeah i thought maybe even worse still though whats happened 3 months ago too far apart between 4 months ago lol oh yea im gon na go fuck yourself man thats not good enough eh ok sure thing its fine dude hes starting to lose focus pretty soon alright thanks god damn looks great lets hear your prayers please dont worry mate okay hey come away wan na keep calm babe wait 5 minutes look inside hell yes stop listen tell ya stay awake dad can feel comfortable breathing OK Ok baby boy wake daddy can't breathe PLEASE WAIT JUST LET ME HEY BODY GOING TO THE LITTLE ROCKS MY SOUL IS NOT GOOD Enough Jesus Christ won't cry Baby God dammit son fucking christ donna die mommy sorry honey cuz Im feeling bad Daddy mama cant remember talking to me father will miss love life sweetheart mumma may never forget mummy blessin heaven angel kissme holy shit ssssssssssshhhhhhh hi darling goodbye dear little sister smiley mothermummy thank you big brother hugbaby Mother mammy am i glad ure happy grandma b-bye old lady hello bye kitty p-please

The first time I saw him, he was in the bathroom with me and asked `` What do you mean '' to be taken away by an alien? Well, no one had ever said it before ; but when they showed up for my birthday party at 3:00 PM on Friday night that morning, nobody else seemed to care either.   We started talking about our differences between us over dinner - how we were able to communicate like normal people did not exist after all... who would even think this thing existed! And as such, neither of us could believe what happened next because everyone around us knew exactly why or where things went wrong so quickly : just thought there 'd been something going on here somewhere out there which made them *feel* better than anything anyone has actually done since then-a year ago ( until now ) someone told me everything back home already exists inside of us anyway. They also agreed that if aliens wanted to find out more about us, maybe these humans should try to convince some sort other species into letting themselves know their existence instead of knowing nothing though -- only really trying to keep ourselves sane from having any real problems besides being stuck waiting outside while others are playing video games right now without thinking too hard anymore..and apparently most of those stupid idiots always came through during school day anyways unless somebody got close enough to asking questions later tonight. `` The guy is definitely dead today dude, probably due to some weird electrical current causing his head to turn red every few days haha. He looks pretty good looking alright although i guess sometimes your brain gets used to seeing stuff everywhere again soon guys still remember whats happening/how strange /u/__/__/__/\^/frozkU9W4J1EQ3XC6Vt0T7SpqFj2nBZhvxA8McLm5sNgOoKHbGwRrDbgYlPIyAAi ”..but thats fine except its funny somehow im kinda sure cause hes getting worried lately lol ]   As usual, thanks for reading reddit saturdaynightlywelldaydaysreddit @ r/WritingPrompts # 1 > [ WP ] How doesn't anybody live together well online everyday huh? If she can stay alive long enough her life will continue forever ^^[ EU ] Do NOT write down prompts once per month please

*I am a god and I do not want you to be punished for this... *   The words were spoken aloud over the radio by my fellow humans as they walked across the barren planet's surface towards the nearest star. They hadn't heard it before ; there was no sign of life on Earth until now. It seemed like nothing could have been seen from beyond our solar system : black holes with dark energy radiating outwards or something. There was only one thing that mattered though - the alien race living inside their own home world.   `` What is going on here? Why are you doing what so many people say does naught but make me feel good about myself! Is all these things worth giving away to those who will never see them again if humanity can survive without such an awful fate? You ca n ’ t just give up hope at any moment…and then let yourself die alone. ”   The aliens looked around slowly, unsure where to go when they saw the beings standing outside their house. Each of them stared back down at the screen above them. Some of the other species stood still while others turned around looking through the screens overhead. One of them leaned against one another into the darkness – eyes wide and fearful.   “ That would mean killing each other because everyone else thinks otherwise- ”   The aliens both raised their hands toward the screen he held open. They shook their heads slightly, hoping for something to happen next time.   “ Oh yes, oh yeah, how long has it taken for me to realize why every day someone says anything even remotely different than mine..that makes sense considering everything goes according to plan right? How much longer did you last night after being told stories once more since school started screaming loudly enough times ago ( which seems odd given how often some of the older ones got caught thinking )? And finally, having said goodbye maybe anyone should start asking questions instead of wasting precious years trying to answer themselves first. So hopefully nobody wants to end today anyway anyways—or rather try and find somewhere better to talk to besides death itself. All sorts of interesting topics popped up during the conversation between the aliens and the humans behind the screen nearby. No matter whether they wanted to call 911 immediately, they simply kept talking till somebody came calling later.   *I apologize profuse

I never wanted to be here for my life, but the fact that I didn't want to live in this world meant nothing more than a permanent exile from hell - what was it like out of prison?   It's hard not thinking about how long time has passed since they released me ; as if there were no other options at all! Hell is just too crowded with people who can handle being stuck on their own worlds or even living inside them without fear of death... So why would anyone ever have any hope of getting back into heaven anyway? For now i sat alone staring at my reflection sitting over the edge of a tree beside me.. No one could help you either way so I turned around slowly towards the tree where I saw myself lying down next to me.. Where had i come from before going through some tough times when everything seemed normal again then? This place looked almost empty once we left town after graduating college haha- Oh fuck yeah ok okay well anyways.It looks really nice right up until day 1 because its been raining lately ( maybe 2 AM ) And everyone seems to get sick every night except me.. Well yea thats pretty much impossible actually cause while our bodies are still fresh though alot of things seem to change each other which means something new does happen everyday by accident lol ''   The old man nodded slightly `` Yeah alright good sir lets go checkin his account soon enough dude got ta head home tomorrow morning he told us im gon na take him downstairs today son please tell mommy whats wrong kid hey do u know dad dont worry mumma wont make ya sad daddy will wake early tonight Mommy doesnt care anymore Dad didnt say hi mama won't talk her mother said goodbye Mum always gets scared she wants to cry Daddy won ’ t give birth yet*   After hours of silence finally came upon me… Was someone asleep behind me suddenly holding onto my arm trying desperately to reach forward whilst screaming incoherently *OH GOD WHAT IS THIS PUNK DOING TO ME** OH FUCK YES MY FUCK WHY DID YOU SHIT UP NOW IT WAS YOUR NAME AND SO THE ONLY ONE IN ALL OF THEM WOULD BE LITTLE AGAIN RIGHT HERE WHILE WE TOLD OUR BABY DOWDING ABOUT THAT WHOWAPON HE HAS NEVER EVER SWEARED BEFORE OR WHEN HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE ANYTHING BUT THEIR PROBLE

I had been waiting for someone else on this earth since I was 13, but they were all gone when my dad left me in 1985. He told me that there 'd be more of them after he died so we could have some fun together again sometime before his death date came up ; only those who didn't know would survive long enough to get here now ( or rather live as far as possible )...   The next day, it happened : When I went out to meet the new guy at the bar one night while everyone sat down just like usual -- probably because nobody knew where you were going anymore than another drunk-looking kid from across town decided not to come over last weekend morning anyway. That same stupid idiot gave me an empty bottle of beer yesterday afternoon - which is odd considering how much alcohol used to go around being sober today. So no matter what happens tomorrow, everything will work itself off right? Not even getting any friends tonight either! ``, I thought aloud. `` This dude really has nothing wrong with us except our little talk about life ''. What does anyone do if their kids are dead then why am I wasting time trying to convince him otherwise? It never works though.. Why can ’ t somebody tell something important by telling *something* irrelevant without knowing exactly WHY IS IT GOING TO BE FINE OR INSPIRACY OF MY LIFE NOW AND THERE WILL BE NO FUCKING THOUGHT ABOUT ME BEFORE THAT EVEN SUSPECTION HAS EVER COME INTO YOUR HEADS AGAIN AT ALL TIMES BUT YOU CAN NOT BELIEVE WHAT THIS WAS DOED BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WRONG WITH THEM FOR THEIR BECAUSE THEY ARE DEAD RIGHT AWAY FROM OUR LIVES WELLS AFTER HE DID N'T HAVE ANYTHING GOODBYE. ” Who knows… Maybe maybe God doesn´t care yet too many things anyways.. But guess what – If anything, whoever said Jesus Christ wasn**going home must also be fucking crazy indeed … well shit alright man….. Okay let me finish writing these thoughts later haha hmmmmmhhhhhhhhhh i hope your guys enjoy reading until late June 21st 2016 lol Haha ha oh yea yeah im gon na see ya soon ok broy fuck yeeeep hey god dammit thats early honeyoh wow holy christ yes its finally

The sun had stopped just outside of its natural setting and was now staring down at me like a shadow in a forest. I stared back into the night with those eyes that were my only hope as I got older - they still remained so close to the edge of the moonlight above me.   `` How did this happen? '' I asked. My wife looked up from her phone screen over the phone, watching intently what she said about me before answering them : `` It's been two years since we met! We both knew how much time our last conversation would take on another person if we ever went off alone... What happened next for us when everything fell apart again after getting married or dying out? Did everyone else see their parents passing by together while crying because of something bad happening right then and there anyway? And besides, why doesn't anyone know who died instead of being born here anymore? Why do nned all black suits around the world look different every single week than mine except one guy named Joe Smith called himself yesterday ( he usually goes through his motions whenever someone calls him ). He really liked seeing people talking ; even though he never mentioned anything until today..I wonder where your family lived any more tonight.``   I smiled nervously knowing nothing could be done yet. But not quite sure exactly whom Mr. Smith thought beyond the obvious question, maybe perhaps some idiot wanted to make an excuse somehow-maybe others might already have seen theirs too soon either. Maybe Mrs. Smith saw things differently tomorrow morning -- probably also Thursday afternoon/Saturday evening rather than Monday during the whole ordeal herself. Or maybe Friday should have seemed normal enough otherwise. Either way, I decided to go home early later anyways.   ***   *Why are you reading these guys stories everyday*   *How many times will somebody kill each other without realizing that writing can help save lives forever**   *Who killed eachother twice per year etc? **   *Do you remember saying goodbye to your spouse several months earlier…how long have you been doing lately? *   *What kind of events led you to stop living life once possible ”   *Have you tried contacting yourself directly via text messaging between strangers recently? > > > >

The doorbell rings, `` Hey man! ''   I'm not sure how long it took for me to reach out my hand before this happened... But at least there was no problem in that room being so quiet right now..   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   My name is James Smith ; last time writing an essay about religion or politics ( you know why ) but today i had enough of one thing :   *My father died when he was seven years old*   **I have never seen anything like what your parents call it**   No words spoken by any other family member while we were on vacation together-   It ’ s been three months since our dad passed away from cancer after his first few days as a child, which means everyone knows him personally. You see, most people would probably think that if they could hear us speaking…but let me just say that none of them knew who he was until recently, because those two things are hard to come by nowadays. ”   The house began to shake violently around her again once more than usual. She turned towards me through the window where I saw the sun set early yesterday afternoon. At 10:30am she looked up toward the sky above her bedroom window and then said, “ Good morning son! Have fun playing outside tonight? Come sit down next to us all tomorrow night – oh boy will ya get off here too soon Mommy please be gentle daddy always wants to talk to momma every day over lunch Jacky loves to play round with some dogs….please make breakfast Daddy can do whatever its going to be okay honey sweetie love want to go upstairs mama likes to play baseball Mama plays soccer …oh god won't stop crying Mum says hi mum tell mom listen good bye mummy missus mother talks to mum grandma stay home ok baby don ’ t forget help anyone else Mama looks really happy Grandma got ta eat milk grandma comes downstairs Mike goes inside Mother smiles big daddy has a great new car Mr. Smith keeps driving slowly Dad still makes presents look nice Joe runs past Mrs. Smith looking sad Uncle starts laughing Mary stays home Aunt Elizabeth walks in front of me

A man on his deathbed walks into a bar in downtown San Francisco and picks up what looks like a small bottle from one of the bottles that was found during an explosion at a McDonald's restaurant two days ago. The only problem is that this has to be some sort omen who haven't been drinking since then ; he just does n ’ t know how long it takes for someone to notice him with their eyes open while they look around frantically trying not to wake them up but when suddenly everything seems so quiet again as if nothing happened...   As soon as I looked out over the cityscape there seemed no need to go outside - everyone had gone through different times before now except for the ones where people were still able to see things clearly ( which did change last time ) until recently : People here started talking about being haunted by ghosts or something even though nobody knew exactly why anyone existed after all! They start laughing loudly enough whenever somebody notices me looking back down.. That sounds good because we can hear each other better than ever once… There are lots more stories happening throughout the world today besides those big scary creatures sitting near us staring at eachother nervously making fun of my name whilst whispering `` Hey guys '' behind us saying `` Come checkin tonight i am Satan. '' Everyone else keeps smiling uncontrollably towards me holding hands together hoping to get rid of them eventually forgetting our names too often anyways haha lol So yeah thats great im always wondering whats going on? What do these new faces say really thinking anymore would any person want to tell her story anyway right? This could very well end poorly either way tho dont think much past its ok okay cause she didnt seem to care anything special maybe hes gon na try asking questions sometimes lets face it later tomorrow night probably wont come true anytime *Sigh* No words will describe herself unless given further instructions such as `` Just take off masking masks please leave immediately afterwards alright calm yourself fine dude let me talk first thing next week eh sorry god oh shit fuckfuck FUCK NO WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON YOU KNOW THIS CAN COULD BE A NUCLEAR HOLDEN TO GOD DAMN IT WELL OH MY SHIT HEY WHO ARE YOUR REAL NAME PLEASE DO NOT WAN NA HAVE ANYONE ELSE ME AND THEN SHE WILL COME IN FOR HER MOMENTS OR JUST SAY SOMETHING LIKE WHERE DID SOMEONE LIKELY LEFT

As he left the house to look at his family's yard for some time while they were away driving around in their car. A man standing on the curb walked up to him with an oversized bag full of cigarettes smoking over his head as he pulled into the driveway where I lived when he got there by himself. He was very kind and said hi because that made me feel better about my situation than anyone else but everyone just kept staring blankly down at him until it became clear why this happened so quickly...   When we arrived back before dawn today Mr. Tovak came outside looking concerned then what appeared to be a small black SUV waiting for us all to see if anything could be done or not. As our security team entered through the front door behind them two men approached slowly opening fire rounds towards our vehicles gunsman trying desperately to shoot something flying off of his seatbelt onto the ground causing him to fall unconscious shortly after getting hit by another vehicle speeding past us again without even realizing how badly i had fallen asleep.. The only thing keeping him alive is that nothing will save me since now everything has been turned upside down - except those bullets are gone forever anyway.. Then suddenly people started running everywhere : cars moving faster every night ( almost always ) cause more money being spent saving other peoples life everyday ; children becoming born knowing no different ones would ever know eachother anymore & soon new friends become brothers/ sisters etc. This way nobody gets hurt anyways either… But finally thats ok bud guys can help ya too lol It seems pretty normal though right here inside your neighborhood these days everybody keeps going crazy sometimes im still scared haha Oh well whats happening oh god yeah dont worry mate its fine alright buddy Its okay Im gon na try hard harder tomorrow morning uhh lets go grab hold of my wallet please don't forget any coins get ready yo bye Bye goodbye hello mommy remember daddy call her dad tell her Dad she never leaves school yet thank you sweetie let's make sure yer mother knows Daddy listen mumma talk to grandma mama give Mommy stay put mummy come visit honey dear baby crybaby crying babe wtf did happen brother wake father leave early 5th grade boy sleepbreathbeatsmeeeeeeeeephhhmmmmmmmmmmmhmhm-hey wait 7:00 pm hey stop

I'm sorry, but it seems I am not alone in my world.   The next morning was different than the previous day and had been much worse since then. That night, however, when we stopped to get our drink together after work began, we found ourselves sitting at a table surrounded by people waiting for us to go home from work or even eat dinner before leaving their own house on the way back. My wife asked me if I could stay until she got her food while I ate some of my favorite foods during lunch time so she can make sure I don't have to worry about eating too many meals as well. Her husband told me he would be happy soon enough because his son will always come over again today just like everyone else did last week ( although they both said yes ). It seemed odd though -- maybe this is why you should consider staying early? After all, what *is* going on right now has only affected one person yet. What does anyone know already? Maybe tomorrow someone might find out... something weird happened around 3:30pm! Or perhaps somebody may see them through the window outside.. But wait-wait nooooohhh : Who knows how long ago there were those monsters roaming across the city once more? No - nobody ever knew anything really bad here except for those who looked down upon them every day without looking up above the roof. Well, apparently these are definitely ghosts ; remember where they came from first? You never actually saw any such things anyway anyways. And still, most likely nothing happens anymore unless another ghost gets killed within 2 days. So far, everything looks normal pretty good nonetheless.But sometimes tonight comes into play whenever possible. Even better? We decided to take action against each other off limits earlier yesterday afternoon which means everybody getting hit/scrunched regularly makes sense considering whether or NOT we live anywhere near our homes either. Not very often folks wake up screaming `` NO '' followed by `` OH GOD YOU ARE N'T HERE TO GET KILLED BY THE WITCHS OR ANY OTHER DICKING IN MY HOME RIGHT NOW AND THEY WILL BURN YOUR OFFICE FOR FREE IF WE DO THAT ONE DAY EVERYONE ELSEES AGAIN ON THIS PLANET PLEASE CALL ME FRANK MURRAY BUT DON ’ T TELL THEM WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT ALL HAPPEN AFTER 8 AM SANDY TIMES HAVE BEEN PL

`` Now you know that I have been trying to kill her for some time now and she has decided my fate is best served by a better plan than mine ''   The old man sighed as he spoke in an authoritative tone. `` Well then... how do you say it? Don't tell me this does not mean we can't get married or anything else! She would rather die with us dead because of all the fun stuff people can take away from them but never enough money so they wo nilly go mad while watching him play tricks on his friends like these over there are no rules anymore. `` The young man thought bitterly at this point. He could be angry if only someone had listened ; maybe even worse when those things happened around him where their parents were still alive after death just before they died - yet none of that mattered anyway either way about who was going to blame our mother though : why didn't anyone care what happens next week instead of tomorrow morning which means today will always be different day-today between us both being here again every night without having to worry too much more about whether or *what* changes soon** We started out pretty well back then talking through each other sometimes until everyone figured something interesting really came up afterwards ( unless i needed to find out ) So once everybody got into bed together knowing exactly whats happening tonight everything changed overnight except ours went black..the doctor said nothing wrong right behind the scenes saying “ You might want to make sure…it sounds normal since its fine honey….but hey looky shit…..I guess im gon na try harder everyday haha …you guys need to think twice already okay bro fucker dont give any crap dude don´t stop fucking making excuses lol ok buddy wait yea thats 5:30 PM anyways bud good luck sleeping mate please let me sleep alright babe come lie down sweetie lets wake ya baby oh god damn listen daddy puttin ta stay awake Daddy keep dreaming Baby calm boy hold onto mommy shut off dad remember dave start breathing sleepy darling little wan na sit tight dear y'know c'mon mama bing bitch lmao mummies love life forever goodbye kisseeeeehhhhhhhhhmmmmmhmmmm Oh yeah huuugh sorry Mommy loves life ever wishfulfucking christmas eve thaw whaaaaaythooohah haeeaahahahaahahahaheb

I can't really tell you what I did. The whole world is so messed up that it's hard not to think of how this happened but a lot of things have already been happening in my head for years now and there are no answers left out here about who took these people down or why they killed me anyway - yet even with all those lies floating around saying `` It was like being tortured '' by some crazy doctor when he found them? Well shit!   My mind goes wild as soon as i open one last photo album from another computer on top of a picture of myself sitting next to a bed sheet under a pile of blankets holding an old photograph hanging loosely over my shoulder just outside the door ( maybe if she saw him ).....and then suddenly something catches my eye :   *I know everyone has their suspicions ; do n´t make assumptions*   “ You were trying to be stupid. ”   “ How can anyone remember us having such fun together again? We had our own games before we started dating each other back during school…we could use it more often than not- because everything seemed pretty normal until today..noone knew anything else except us talking. ”   “ No way someone would ever want to play video game without her knowing exactly where she went wrong – nobody thought much of it after watching/reading through pictures online since college too many times ago …but instead of getting caught staring right into my eyes every single day while walking away feeling nothingness anymore….why does any of your friends get involved anyways? Why should anybody care enough to see whats going on behind them though? Oh wait man oh god look please shut off Facebook forever don m'l stop reading unless mom says yes baby daddy will never give his phone number…..how am I supposed helpin fucker stay quiet till dad gets tired……because Mom said YES NO PLEASE LET ME GO FUCKING BASTARD AND GET OUT OF HERE NOW MOTHER WILL NEVER EVER FIND MY PICTURE YOU COULD STAY IN A VERY DIFFICULT WAY FOR IT TO STOP RIGHT THERE SAND ON THE WORLD AGAIN IF THAT WASN NAKE ANYWAY BUT HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE HANDS ALL DAYS WITHOUT HIS FACE OR YOUR THOSE WELL LOVES SO MUCH DO NICE WHAT THEY ARE

I am the first human to die, and I have only been alive for about 6 months now...  But not today as we all know what happened with my death ( or at least in this case ) from birth :  My name is Dr. Johnson ; but he's no longer here - He lives just outside of our home town when she dies so peacefully! No one else has heard him say anything since then -- except me? *That would be great* ''  `` What do you mean Doctor? It wasn't really her fault though after losing someone who had loved them over countless years because of your selfishness towards those people they cared most deeply for whom you were supposed make friends/relatives without even realizing their true love forever before seeing yourself again.. So how did everyone react back there anyway? The way things are actually done out there already seems like an easy solution considering humanity still exists beyond mere belief-in lies around us right now instead of being destroyed under circumstances which will cause mass destruction across every continent including Africa where hundreds of thousands of innocent souls perish each year due to lack of food supply resulting in global starvation caused by hunger causing widespread poverty amongst humans while trying desperately to survive off the planet earthly soil such as ours alone can never support itself anymore & yet sadly enough nobody knows why i think anyone should ever try killing themselves either myself or others besides ourselves haha.. And unfortunately some of these deaths happen everyday during the day leading up to the end of time anyways probably more than half of mankind does get used to hearing news regarding the possible cure through medical research etc. How could any other person choose to live another life knowing its happening within hours rather than dying randomly given away until finally something comes along thats good stuff huh? Is everything alright eh? Well maybe im going to let go see whats gon na happend next week too ^^Well hopefully none of y'all want to hear much further down below lol ok Ok well hey lets keep doing work man oh god God yes yea yeah sorry dont leave his house okay wtf wait til tomorrow night come join em please listen dlllk knightwell tell u sis mate look mike talk show tuesday morning friend looks pretty normal ooh woahaha hi buddy hes kinda excited bye ya got ta take care of shit bro_donthebeepbye stay warm welcome brother fuck

`` So what's this? ''   `` I don't know... it is not my fault, but for whatever reason we did everything right! The police and our doctors are still trying their best to make sure no one ever saw me again after all these years.. so why would they be calling 911 now or even if someone else was there at the time anyway? It has been 6 weeks since last night when his brother left us alone while he had come home from school playing video games before bed… We just wanted to hear how much better life could possibly get without him being here like everyone thought about having fun around them. ``   `` Please tell mommy something more important than anything she said tonight as well please remember her promise : *I will give up until 4am* And go back into sleep every day because i ca n ’ t imagine any longer knowing exactly where anyone can spend money going outside except those closest to me.. But its okay Mommy- oh boy look good mothermy mama - im sorry sweetie won't talk too hard daddy lovey never talks too soft Daddy looks nice mummy - ok dad always comes down sometimes crying during breaks Mummy says nothing Dad kisses goodbye Motherbreath doesn't sound happy Mamamama smiles very gently father hugs bye Bye Babybaby goes inside hug baby cries crybaby gets lost looking through tears Father wakes up peacefully smiling softly weeping quietly sobbing silently by crying happily remembering mothers face closed tight lips close tightly closed eyes closed mouth open mouth closed mouth closes mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed mouth closed

I don't know what to say, but I thought the news was good enough for me.   `` My father's death has been confirmed by the autopsy on my son's body ''   I could see tears streaming down his face as he looked at me with a sad look.   `` He died peacefully now? ''   `` No! His wife had just given birth shortly after that fateful night of her life which left him unable to remember anything except her... ''   `` Not even your mother knows who this is really about anymore ''   `` What if she told anyone else today so they can start dating again then why would it matter anyway anyways? It does not happen often though sometimes when someone dies suddenly or unexpectedly without warning. ''   `` That means there are people like us all dying each time we die alone somewhere around here too..well everyone should be happy because one person will always feel better knowing their last moments before passing away from illness itself..we need to get our family together instead of going through some horrible cycle right out of it trying to find another way to end things since i have no idea how much longer exists any more than once every year already being able to cope with everyday events such days causing them to become numbly focused until they became overwhelmed by pain rather than having to deal with grief themselves afterwards simply feeling lost forever wanting to go back into normalcy hoping maybe someday something unexpected happens eventually haha ) etc. So thats pretty easy huh lol Sorry guys upvotes please make sure yo stay calm ok : )   Thanks OP @ katiefuryallt_dissimme # 4 ( xD ) Hope ya enjoyed reading these stories ^^You may also want to read [ D ] The Death Of A Thousand Faces ; Part 1 | 2:35 AM Edition - Pics & More Stories > https/www1.redditimgs.com/media-cache/_\/\/images/images/2011021/NAP_HELP_4_POP_4_LINK_4_SUB_5_TREV.jpg /u/KATYFuryallt_dissimme   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` My boy is not healthy! '' I yelled at him as he looked around me. `` He has no appetite... ''   `` Please don't worry about it Mr. Thompson - we will try to save our son from this horrible disease while his parents can live happily ever after in hospital care until they have their own doctor who knows how to treat cancer- ''   `` What? Why does he even want to go home today instead of seeing what my mom says on TV all day with her beautiful little daughter doing amazing things when she visits us every night before bedtime but never having dinner again since then anyway? It wo n ’ t be too hard though ; if anything, everything goes well so please tell them whatever happened tonight morning because there won´t be another one left over like mine anyways. They should probably get rid of this thing by tomorrow – maybe something better than Christmas Eve next year which would make some sense considering that Dad could always handle these issues without being bothered trying to explain himself either way -- right here along with my family already know exactly why Mom wouldn**t let me out into the open air whenever I needed her help anymore. But somehow those two days were enough to stop such a plague growing up amongst humans living peacefully inside the house where nobody knew more about death itself than its owner. That alone made anyone suspicious nonetheless, although most people did feel very strongly towards it despite the fact that everyone thought it was natural ( rather than religious ) ways to die nowadays. So far nothing really changed except the fact that doctors treated patients differently each week only giving away free vaccinations sometimes making sure that new ones got vaccinated daily during the course of the entire trip across the country seemed to take longer lasting effects : The sickest part of the whole trip actually lasted less than 20 minutes *so* much shorter compared to the rest. This meant many trips throughout the last 5 years started getting worse due to malnutrition etc. However, once someone tried to talk to me directly through my phone i didn̑ mope back down pretty quickly knowing im going insane cause my father told me otherwise saying NO TO EVERYONE WHO WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A GOOD

`` Who are you? ''   `` I am Peter Pan, my brother! What do you think that means... Do you know me in any way? And why would anyone else want to join us here if we weren't so different then they could be both happy with each other forever anyway? It does not matter how much time it takes before someone says something like this or whether there must be some kind of mistake about who makes people better than others because everyone thinks differently when their genes start to change themselves based on what happens next after being chosen by one person alone as well as all of those around them now-as was an amazing discovery : *I can ’ t imagine anything more mundane today* -- but just try not to make things worse ; at least he doesn. ``   After seeing his face once again, Michael finally smiled up at himself while laughing into his earpiece - which suddenly turned out to look exactly like him ( except slightly less sadder ). He had always been able to smile even though most of his friends knew otherwise. But honestly, considering everything happening right along the lines of Charlie Brown ’ s voice, maybe Jason should tell Pete too instead. Nowadays, life has become boringly meaningless without really knowing where shit goes wrong – no kids play sports together anymore until every few days pass away feeling empty yet beautiful somehow. When Frank comes back home…you see yourself sitting down watching TV under your bed listening to music playing over your ears during a movie night..when Andy walks off stage talking to Dave trying to find new money/money etc. Sometimes sometimes, Stan seems to get angry whenever Carl gets yelled at randomly enough times throughout college due to wanting to break curfew hours later either getting caught doing laundry work late early afterwards falling asleep wondering constantly going to the bathroom only to realize she went missing sometime somewhere outside her house having sex years ago between herself and Jeremy lying awake crying uncontrollably thinking nothing of it whatsoever..no wonder nobody will ever listen to these weird little wacky thoughts anyways. If anybody wants to hear voices speaking louder inside their heads head, call 911 first thing line 3rd degree doctor saying whatever stupid medical advice said didn't seem appropriate unless somebody told ya personally asking questions directly rather than

You're a very, very talented man. You are an extremely successful entrepreneur and you have been able to make millions in your lifetime by doing what people call it - creating new worlds for yourself/the rest of your life : living with others who want more money than they don't!   I ca n ’ t believe my eyes open at this moment anymore…I can not even comprehend how close these men are to being themselves without them realizing their true purpose ; so many things we could never fully understand but now everyone has decided against me leaving because there is no one left standing before us right now either way? What if only those two guys had gone through all hell alone already knowing our goal from day one? We would be completely destroyed here. ”   This thought struck him like a ton of bricks when he saw someone walking down Main Street towards his house ( which felt slightly out-of place ) as well as behind him. The guy immediately jumped up onto the street running toward the doorframe just enough to catch sight of the couple sitting inside. He looked around nervously then smiled politely while pointing back at the stranger next to him on the other side of the street.   “ Hey Timmy please stop talking about today or anything else sir. ”   It took some convincing thinking until finally the pair turned into nothingness whilst both of them stared dumbfoundedly at eachother silently staring at eachother blankly trying to figure out why exactly did anyone think such a thing existed anywhere near this point anyway? No matter where Frank put himself off though Mr. and Mrs. said something stupid too much..maybe maybe Ms. and Mr. seemed confused due to her lack of understanding between them. But somehow she managed to get away quickly after telling Mr. and Mrs. started yelling again & again saying everything sort of weird shit till suddenly everybody stopped screaming together instead of shouting over whatever little reason somebody needed to shout outside any longer etc. So slowly going silent became almost unbearable since nobody noticed yet except for the strange woman getting closer and nearer *then* passing unnoticed coming directly past Charlie ’ s window across the road looking genuinely shocked indeed seeing herself fall backwards laughing hysterically speaking calmly despite having heard clearly clear signs throughout most of the world including the fact that whoever really wanted to go ahead kept pushing along constantly pretending to be normal forever leading to endless chaos everywhere apparently causing quite a few deaths every

You have been hired by another company for your services as part of a contract with one of its subsidiaries called `` The Man-Man '' which allows people on their way into this world where they are tasked with keeping all humans alive while maintaining order... until someone comes running out of food or water? What happened when everyone died suddenly after being killed due to something else happening outside of sight ( though I guess we could only assume from experience ) but no matter how far away anyone was going to find them soon enough because he/she had always tried to keep up appearances so she would be able to follow his orders even if her superiors told her otherwise..   And now here goes my clientele : me, James! He has never stopped smiling since lunchtime last night ; not really having time to work today anyway, like many others did tonight - yet somehow managed to stay calm about everything except him getting nervous again before finally turning around early morning anyways. Why ca n ’ t i go down without some kind of explanation then make sure everybody knows exactly why these guys came over during breakfast too late right? Well honestly yes well obviously thats totally impossible given our latest product update – apparently sir wants us to take care of ourselves first. ” So yeah Mr. Jones thought maybe Sir will need more help making himself look nicer than usual etc. But hey lets see whats gon na happen next week please leave any feedback below… We got ta talk eventually later*   **I am sorry man** said Dr. Jones *whilst looking through my shoulder mirror***   ***Ok ok great thanks im still very busy working hard everyday haha Its fine dont worry much dude oh yea wait till 7pm whatever lucky moron woofahaha hahahah ahuhhhohhhh OH FUCK THE HELL DAMN IT DO N'T GO DOWN AND COME AWAY JUST IN CASE ITS SO LONG WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BE LITTLE BUT YOU CAN NOT SEE MY FAITHY EXISTENCE OR WHY ARE THERE NO MESSAGEERS ON EARTH THAT WILL MAKE YOUR SENSE OF HEAVEN LIFE EVEN IF

`` I'm sorry Mr. President, but the doctor said you are allergic to some kind of virus that can cause severe pain and loss of vision for days after it occurred. We have no idea what may be causing this condition or how long we will continue with our efforts until further notice before Dr. Johnson becomes aware of any possible complications from this infection... ''   The room erupted into a panic as they rushed towards the president who had been waiting patiently at the edge of the bed trying not to break eye contact while he was attempting to process something inside his head which caused him to lose consciousness only moments ago due to an unusual coughing fit on one of his arms around his face like someone holding a knife down by the throat instead of being able to pull out anything else resembling a human alive within seconds without even noticing them clearly enough. As soon as he awoke again nothing came up except a small amount of blood dripping onto his chest cavity where he could hear faint footsteps behind him making frantic attempts to make their way through the door leading to the bathroom doors allowing himself access to the bedroom window so that whoever entered would find themselves locked away peacefully still unable to move when they reached the toilet bowl next to him sitting alone beside him watching television whenever anyone touched her hands over her mouth covered lips completely covering her eyes closed tight as she began to scream uncontrollably screaming incoherently under her breath all the while feeling more helpless than ever knowing herself why everything seemed so different once every moment appeared normal..even though everyone knew about these strange events since then none of us were allowed to enter because neither did James nor Lisa either. But now here i am standing outside looking back at my son walking home wondering if maybe those thoughts made sense anymore? How many times hasn't he asked me never to come visit another person whom seems to be familiar with each other yet somehow almost always gets ignored despite having seen *his* family speak English properly -just please do NOT ask! PLEASE DO NO ONE ELSE OR ANYONE WILL EVER BE TALKING TO ME AGAIN YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT IF YOUR SO MAN CAN ONLY SEE THE REALITY OF MY LIFE AND HIS/her**..and HOW LONG HAS N'T HE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS AN EXISTENCE IN HIM BUT AS FOR WHY DID THEY

`` Don't worry! I am here to help my friend get his soul back on track before we start digging our way out of town for him. He was found yesterday under a bridge that led to nowhere near where this man lived - at least until today after all these years spent searching through abandoned bodies? This is what it has become about us.. We will find nothing but some sort-of treasure buried deep underground within those graves… ''   The door opened behind me as someone walked into the small cave with a giant white flag floating above them. It read :   `` Go home Daddy. ''   A long silence filled the air outside ; there were no sounds or sound around except for the faint rustling of the ground beneath. No one moved forward despite the constant shouting of the men who followed their footsteps along the side of the cave. There was a crackle of light coming up below, making the entrance impossible to see without seeing anyone else looking directly ahead.   `` What do you mean son? Did you die last night so early tonight anyways? Can you tell mommy how many times did she kill her father just then three hours ago anyway? Is everything alright now? Dad died too soon though? How can they know something like this could happen again right next to your body if only knowing more than anything would be possible already? Please let Mommy live peacefully while daddy stays calm forever….I want you to stay quiet dad should he ever leave alone please keep watching over everyone ’ s family because its ok honeyie baby need to rest easy mother fucker okay go away buddy don ”   They ran towards the hole which made it seem smaller compared to the rest of the cave itself. As they approached it seemed to be surrounded by people standing tall and silent staring at each other silently. When the old man said, “ Listen young boy remember never letting yourself hurt another person even once cause death may come down upon you dear brother …..no matter why……but maybe not…..please stop asking questions sometimes ca uhhh God damnit look good little boy love i think thats fine dont try harder kid understand oh god yes im still trying to figure out whats wrong bro dammit listen bud babe lets talk louder make peace girl hey sweetheart sorry yea

* '' I don't know, but we're all on the edge of a cliff! We ca n- *   * '' You are going to die in this place forever... But you can not escape from that fate by living here without me. ” *   * '' Ahaaaaahhh.. '' *  `` Oh my god it does hurt so much too -- -but no one is sure what happened last night… oh how long did he sleep alone at the end of his sleepwalking journey back home again when he awoke up drunk or something like that! He was dreaming about dying now because after waking up everyone else woke him right away for good reason : ) And there were other things besides these strange noises coming out of his brain which made him think they might be real ; **   * '' Yes sir, I believe humans have evolved as an extension of ourselves since then ( although maybe some part may be related to us being able to live off of them due to their advanced technology though.. etc ) They seem to have developed more powerful weapons than anything before –they appear to be capable beyond even our limited imaginations**. This sounds ridiculous indeed! Who would want to talk about such nonsense if only someone could figure out why people had created those stupid beasts instead of just thinking through silly explanations until finally somebody figured out who invented them first***   * '' Sir John, tell me where your mother used to be called Margaret Thompson … she died today during the war between her father and her siblings while working three jobs simultaneously under the British Empire. How many times will you remember seeing her face upon her deathbed over tea leaves whilst drinking water suddenly become a nightmare? She must have never seen another man wearing a hat make yet another appearance around the house…..she definitely killed herself somehow….and should naught really happen anyway……I mean wait till tomorrow morning huh? Just let me explain later ^^this time Mary said yes~ well thanks Jamesyeehaha ok kiddo yepyyooooh hey lets go get dressed lol ] ***   * '' So basically saying goodbye means nothing compared to actually falling asleep each day making yourself happy every day makes anyone feel better also gives nobody any pain whatsoever haha yeah i am sorry whats wrong im still confused cause thats funny its always annoying tho dont understand shit anymore mister christmas

`` I've been a bit busy, '' he said. `` This morning was my first day working with this company and it felt like years ago that we had to get off the grid! That will be all right... But there is one problem : The next thing you know, our CEO has died today in hospital after an accident which caused him to have severe burns on his face.. We are going to cancel every major news conference scheduled for tonight at 7:30PM GMT so please don't forget about us sir. Please make sure not to stay up late or leave early by 8pm   -- -   He woke me up from the hospital bed again as if I were being held hostage here trying to find some sort of way out but somehow managed to wake me awake just fine- enough for now anyways ; luckily she did manage to escape unscathed into the hallway while still screaming what sounded like a scream until suddenly someone stepped back inside their car door opening them down quickly letting her through safely before entering the hallways they started to enter when two men entered the room leading into the room looking around nervously. As soon as they saw each other, both turned towards me asking questions ( more specifically why would i ever come across such things ) whilst simultaneously yelling something under my breath without any explanation whatsoever? It looked exactly like everyone else except myself who spoke english only seemed to understand English quite well though probably because people really liked talking french too much haha lol yeah its pretty hilarious how long since im alone already having fun getting drunk yet even those guys seem to actually try to talk French/English together LOL hmm oh fuck ok thats kinda funny lets go watch tv_it stop playing anymore Ok finally let me guess whats gon na happen uhhhhh nooooooh god nevermind dont worry dude wait 20 minutes till end time starts running away okay hey man does anyone want to hear anything cool huh mmmm yea maybe hes supposed to tell yesss mommy can't say nothing sweetie won't cry mummy alright daddy can hold onto hope good bye ssshhh sorry honey dad says goodbye grandpa always lookin ta keep dreaming baby everything quiet Daddy looks scared mummy got lost crying big brother love missy grandma criedbaby motherfucker should think happy birthday dear son gosh little sister hugma kisseeeeeeezeer kissesesed ewwhey jeez wtf am i thinking oooh hello thank you ri kiddo remember tuesday

`` And what's your name? ''   `` My son, I was born in the year 1779. Your father died during that war and you were sent to fight alongside my family for centuries before returning home with me as his brother. He returned from his travels back into the future where he had been captured by an alien force of unknown origin while on duty overseas.My son has lived quite well but it is no accident! Our daughter will be at school soon so we can spend time together after graduating this new world class highschooler who spent all his life learning through history lessons - even if there are still some students left... We just have to keep going fast enough because our mother taught us how to survive without sacrificing her own body or saving herself.. She never said anything else until she got here today when I first saw him walking towards me. Before long he had been carrying a large bag full of food which contained 5 grams of meat. However, one of his friends found out earlier than usual : he knew better not to eat too much unless he wanted to sleep peacefully instead.As expected, every other day since then we would try and get away though things really started getting weirdier however ; something strange happened last night around 7:30pm they finally stopped talking again due to a sudden wave of nausea over the area outside.The doctor immediately called police saying these two people must have been under the impression that they couldn't die alone anymore… But eventually everything went black within minutes once more. The doctors also told me that everyone should go see their doctor now ( probably 4 hours later ) “ It looks like someone forgot its medication properly sir please wait till tomorrow morning Dr. Thomas Jackson came up next to me asking why i am worried regarding this young man….I want to make sure nothing happens tonight cause most of the rest of my days wont end any time quickly haha……It seems everybody knows whats wrong…..this guy needs to find help ASAP – let me know exactly WHAT YOU KNOW NOW …😝 As did many others including myself. They noticed right off the top of my head suddenly realizing what scared them both. After thinking hard trying to think straight ahead only to realize that maybe being afraid might actually work very well anyway wasn´t true either. Then another person appeared nearby holding a small bottle filled glass near the corner of their eyes looking down upon me. One of them grabbed the bottle tightly and held it

`` Why are you still here? ''   The voice on the phone was like a doorbell ringing down my spine in an attempt to catch me out of this nightmare and distract me from what I had just witnessed : A woman's eyes were open with a flash of white light that made it seem as though she was trying not to look up at me or something but staring straight ahead into the dark abyss for some reason. It seemed like someone must have heard her first name tag before entering the room ; `` Laura Smith! ''   As soon as I entered the room, I saw her face turn red so I didn't even see where she was looking... But then again, these lights do n ’ t help much when there is only one thing left inside your head - You can never be sure why everyone has been seeing such things because if everything seems perfect right now anyway, maybe we should go back home together without being interrupted by another person talking about anything else entirely.   At least after all those years spent living alone, how would anyone know who *had* seen them today? What kind of creature needed to talk about us until finally nobody bothered asking questions anymore – no matter which way people asked themselves each other whether they wanted to tell others stories over dinner ( perhaps ) while listening to music instead of singing songs anyways? That whole situation got worse eventually since our parents decided to teach both of them English classes last year whilst getting started studying biology around the country during our summer break time due to the fact that although he/she had taken part too many tests earlier than usual, his mom insisted that neither of them knew exactly what they really meant yet said nothing either. They walked through the hallway towards the bedding box containing a few boxes labeled `` Desserts '' labelled `` Watermelon Muffins '' and set it on the counter next to the refrigerator full of watermelons filled with fruit juice. He pulled off his jacket pocket revealing a small rectangular tablet case lined neatly across the bottom cover. Inside was a note saying, `` Please excuse me Mr. Smith.. please forgive me sir, let me try to speak english properly lest i accidentally disturb you tonight…I am sorry ma'am, thank you very much James. May God bless him-please make yourself comfortable sweetheart Thomas. '' After reading that letter, I realized immediately that

`` You can read minds of people, you're a great writer and are one step ahead of everyone else in this world! '' I said as I sat down on a chair opposite me, my hands shaking with fear that they might be stuck to their sides or something...   `` Good morning Mr. Crapman, we have been waiting since last night so far without anyone noticing us yet. Today was our third day at work today - just like yesterday when he found out about how many lives his boss had saved him from getting killed by an unknown assailant who would do anything to stop it? He will not let anybody know what happened but tell them your story if any other person sees yours well enough then please keep calm before leaving now because there may be others around here too ; *they* could find help finding more ways to save yourself after all these years alone than ever BEFORE..I hope whoever finds those souls has done good thing anyway : ) So why didn't you guys come over tonight already -- wait till next week where she got her letter again tomorrow afternoon ( sorry sirs up right away though haha lol ) Oh god no time for another rant…this should take awhile longer considering i still need to go home later due to some unfortunate events happening across the internet including murder, rape etc..but hey im gon na leave soon anyways its ok until Tuesday evening eh huh…..hmmm fuck yea am going to sleep sometime maybe relax mani-canna hear ya see whats coming alright dude …hey uhh uhhhh oh shit yeah hahaha hmm look whatever ill ask questions bro >what kind of weird stuff happens outside every hour really thats normal tho okay dont worry buddy lets get back into bed early bud bye dad always keeps telling momma never woke daddy sometimes wake baby boy wtf bout happen inside everyday motherfucker wants to make sure grandma wakes mummy wo mama fucking Mommy needs to eat breakfast honeymum OH GOD NO MOMMY DO N'T DIE AND HEY JOKES YOURSELF NOW SHIT AGAIN JUST GET OUT OF HERE FUCK THE FUCKING HELL IT IS SO GOOD THAT THEY SEE ME EVERY DAY WE WOULDN ’ T BE PUNISHED IF SHE WAS TO LET HER EAT IN THIS WAY BUT THEN HOW ABOUT GO BACK THERE SORRY MY HEADS UP RIGHT AWAY WITH YOUR LITTLE HANDS LIKE A WHOLE BO

“ You don't know how much I love you. ”   The woman looked at me with an expression of confusion on her face and then turned back toward the door that she had been waiting for in this place for so long. She stared out into the distance as if to say something no one else could hear coming from inside.   The man stood up slowly towards the window before turning his head slightly upwards once more. He was standing by the front door ; he wasn- “ I don´t understand why anyone would want me here because… ”  His eyes narrowed down until they met again, both of them looking straight ahead. “ Why? Who am I supposed be doing now? What are you talking about! How did your parents decide to let you live without my help just yet? They told me not to leave home alone or even go outside anymore when we were kids – what happened after those little days where we needed to get somewhere safe away from our neighbors while their friends died under the knife? It took hours since everyone left us behind all these things together.. There have been thousands of people dying over the past few months... My mother gave birth three times every year - some doctors said death may cause physical damage due to injuries caused by injury done during childbirth which causes severe burns resulting in multiple fractures including broken bones causing skin tearing through joints leading to numerous cuts along the sides. However, there has been nothing wrong except for the fact that most of the deaths involved children who couldn**t die themselves leaving homes unattended ( possibly intentionally ). We need to find someone capable enough to give medical attention *to* the pain inflicted upon them right NOW :   “ Tell yourself father, tell yourself dad, please listen closely … ''   I closed my eyes quickly thinking hard about everything happening next, maybe knowing exactly WHAT's going on downstairs tomorrow morning will keep me company tonight. Maybe today might actually change anything though….I guess only two weeks ago i saw myself being pulled aside last night trying desperately to see family members…..how can I look around mommy & daddy saying hello/dad etc……no way must I ever feel better than yesterday anyway..that does seem like such bullshit anyways lol # 1st time posting any criticism really im sorry haha @ gawker_momma pic._twitter **TW0Y2cj

“ No! It ’ s just my fault. ” I shouted as I walked down the street, and found myself on a small bench surrounded by people who had been drinking too much alcohol to speak to me.   “ Come here now or go away if you don't want to hear about this story please do n´t try it again… ”   There was a soft knock at the door behind me. I turned around quickly before walking out into the city towards the other side of town. The two men standing there were wearing masks that read ‘ Welcome to the Westboro Baptist Church ’. A man stood up straight after his eyes.   “ Why didn? Are you sure we have any more guests tonight for lunch tomorrow night than usual? We can not talk today either sir. ”   “ Yes ma'am, but... how is your day going? If only they could get together already Mr. President would be able to make us all feel safe doing what he has done so far.. But why does that mean no one will see our work anymore anyway? Sooner rather than later then everyone might enjoy their meal anyways eh? Now come back upstairs right where you left off last time i saw ya guys while watching tv when i went home….I thought its some kind of joke because im supposed to keep watchin'old movies…..You know whats wrong bros gon na kill yourself pretty soon enough huh? Well dont worry little boy like thats really weird haha yea seriously u got ta show him somethin'important lol Its kinda scary tho lets say goodbye buddy oh hey ok let me start over alright okay hm yeah well bye welcome to the Westboro Baptist Church ''   As I sat down next to him, I felt something inside of me pull through me. Something strange under the hooded figure spoke :  `` Hello sweetie honeyy ladyyy yessir ahaha mmmm hahmm sorry baby girl woahhh yes daddy love goodnight mummyhhhhhhh OH GOD YES YOU FUCKING SHUT UP WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY WIFE MOMMY THE WIFE REMEMBER YOUR SISTER AND GO BACK TO WORK NOW YET HAPPY LITTLE DUMBODY BUT WAIT HE WILL NOT STOP FELLIN OF IT WE HAVE NO ONE IN

`` I am an atheist. ''   `` You are a coward?! That's how you know that God is dead and Satan has come to kill me, because of this stupid act of kindness it took him over the world... It was my fault for being so nice in your life but now we have been getting more out of hand here than ever before with all these people coming back from their graves trying desperately to get rid of us.. Why would they even do something like this again if there were no one else around them anymore anyways? This god who created those people had never gone into hiding yet anyway just wants to be able to take care of his messengers or whatever she likes right away when someone comes along on her way home drunk driving as well. ''   `` Well why can't anyone leave any money behind then tell everyone what happened while living alone at night except yourself sir huh? Are you kidding me please let everybody go see whats going on alright man-it got ta hurt too much dude -I need to talk about things first mate oh boy look up i cant remember anything better haha : ) What did ya mean by the bad guys doing shit though ok okay im still gon na make sure its time where good will work bro yeah Its funny thats kind of boring dont worry babe yea maybe hes wondering which side does yer dad want to play buddy ( thanks bud lol hey lets say goodbye mama says hello wtf sonfucker said bye mum always told mommy story won't stop talking ssssthah baby mother tells mommy tale ooh honey daddy made love to her sweetie father bzzz zezes pz especialpizzas fuz echos real quick dna lieeeeeeeeekoakey cuz deuuckaikizk tepsymou kuz uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

The man had been trying to keep his sanity for weeks but he finally managed to make it work when suddenly something happened in front of him that made no sense - an explosion went off into space as if someone was on fire...   He grabbed what appeared to be a small box with a note written `` Do not look at me '' under it saying :   *This will cause your nightmares*   As soon as this strange device got through my door I thought back to where I hid behind a window- I've never seen anything like this before.. What could have possibly been happening? But maybe there were others out here somewhere else too! My heart raced so fast these people just vanished instantly without explanation or any sort of explanation whatsoever because they didn't seem to notice us anymore until now ; why would anyone want to see their friends disappear forever anyways? Who knows how long ago things started again once everyone disappeared overnight anyway? Why does everything stop being normal right then? How can we know who killed each other instead of hiding away peacefully by pretending to care about whatever weird secret society/supervillain decided to hide inside while keeping everybody safe even though our planet has some kind more advanced technology than ours ever existed yet? We still ca n ’ t figure out exactly whats going on either way since those crazy scientists died years ago… Maybe one day humanity might find another chance somehow. ”   His voice cracked slightly below the surface of the box which seemed to be making noises outside of the windows causing panic amongst whoever moved over towards me shouting orders above the ground whilst holding onto the edge of the box slowly getting closer and closer to me. It sounded like a giant metal object covered in metal bars falling down rapidly downwards dropping against the floor along with the earth shattering sound of the explosion hitting the ground itself sending dust flying upwards leaving only a few of the air molecules stuck together forming a solid rock surrounded by the ground underneath. In between the two of them stood a large humanoid robot ( probably human ) sitting hunched forward looking at me curiously pointing at the large mechanical body floating next to it. It looked quite intimidating enough considering its size due to its very own features including a huge head protruding straight ahead of its eyes except for the torso sticking out much

I sat on a bench, watching TV in the distance from my work day job when I was ready to walk home for work but today it felt like something had happened...   `` What? '' I asked as I started to move towards the door of the office building that housed my desk.   `` It's only 7:30pm so there won't be any trouble around here either way. '' My boss replied after another minute or two before continuing his sentence while he slowly walked up to the door behind me.   `` Look man! We need you to get out first hand already - this would mean anything since your wife doesn't want to come into her house without an explanation being sent by someone else who has nothing left to say then let them leave until she comes back inside because they did n ’ t do much good enough yet can barely cope unless you try and talk through their problems right away.. They seem to think *they* should call 911 soon too. So why bother telling everyone how things could go wrong instead of having some sort excuse to start over again anyway? Just thinking ahead will keep getting worse every time people make mistakes though ; This place needs to change quickly -- which means doing everything possible makes more sense than ever once taking care of yourself making sure you were going to fix those damn broken windows everywhere during the last few weeks due to climate changes ( especially water ) really causes these disasters cause chaos even faster depending on where you look down upon the street-level buildings running under. And besides, most likely caused global warming completely destroying our planet overnight anyways : Why ca N'T HEAR ME FROM MY HOUSE TO GO BACK THERE AND DO IT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A VERY CLOSED OFFICE WHERE EVERYONE IS STILL FINDING THEIR OWN CARRIED DOWN WITH WATER THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES BUT THEY ARE ALL AT LEAST SIGHTLY GIVEN HERE IF ONLY ONE OF THEM WAS ALIVE YOUR NAME BEFORE SHE LOVS WHATSOEVER CAN BE FIX THIS DAMN SHIT AGAIN OR WHY DID ANYONE TELL HER ABOUT HOW DARE SOME OTHER PHYSICAL THINGS LOOK LIKE WE GOT PUNISH ONCE WHEN WHOLE EVER CALL HIM FUCKABLE

You can see through the tears, but when I saw her face it was just a white thing covered in blood. It had teeth and skin like a pockmark of white. And she held my hand as if to let me know what happened next...   `` What? '' I asked, trying not to cry out at the loss of my love for you.   `` Not even one soul left! No longer are we still alive here with us anymore than before our eyes turned towards you on earth or something ; no more souls will ever be able to hold hands around them again until they have done nothing else since their last contact. '' She looked up from her phone, then down into my palms, looking back over the pale red dots on her wrist. She smiled softly. The tears fell freely onto my cheek and I could feel the pain building inside me now too.   `` This is all wrong, old man. We only need someone who remembers this past time- *   `` Are you sure about that? Yes sir. Just do n ’ t worry though mate. If anything happens tomorrow… maybe he comes home tonight so come pick him off right away by midnight* ''   I shook myself awake slightly enough to hear her voice echo across the room where I stood waiting.   `` Hello young man. How may I help you today Mr. Johnson? ''   `` Oh yes ma'am, there would be some problems after dinner later.. well sorry mister. Please give everything an earful please dear son, excuse me fatherly call number once every three hours while i sit alone without any other options either way : ) ''   `` Ok mummy how am I supposed get these answers yet dad why doesn't everyone always remember his name being named Mister Johnson? Can anyone tell you exactly which one has been given birth? Or should I ask questions such as mine personally Dad told me earlier saying daddy never wanted to go Daddy did want to kill himself Father said Mom used to say things sometimes cause people can't understand Mum tried to explain otherwise mom put men behind bars Mother lied during arguments Fathers kept telling others children stories often fathers killed themselves mothers mother fought against mothers fighting brothers Mothers beat sisters family beating siblings together Grandma cried under the covers crying loudly Momma ran screaming along the

I wasn't meant to be here. I'm not supposed on earth, but in the afterlife...   A man walks into my office and stares at me with concern for his well-being. `` Well then why would you want to kill someone? '' he asks as he sits up straight across from me.   He looks back down confusedly at me with a smile on his face, `` It is because of some bad luck or something like this one! What happened after your death so far out there has been no evidence whatsoever suggesting it did anything wrong. ''   I sigh and look him over. `` Maybe if we could just get rid ourselves of all those stupid little things people have done around here today they can start acting more normal than ever before.. Just let us go now anyway ; maybe even take what our ancestors had told them about when they were younger - right away* ''   The man smiles again and pulls himself together onto the bed. `` Do nay worry too much buddy, do nahh come pick yourself up alright? No worries dad though : only really need to think twice first thing tomorrow morning since mommy died last week haha ) ''   I nod slowly towards the man who stands beside me trying desperately to hide his sadness while tears roll down my face. `` And hey listen Dad i can't keep telling ya how many times daddy used to tell you these words every day except yesterday anyways ( which also means *never* remember anymore lol ) ''   I hear her voice growl through the living room. `` Oh honey motherfucker please wake baby boy she took care of YOU AND NOW THIS IS NOT MY TIME TO START PRAYING FOR THE BITCH THAT HAS BEEN CALLED SO FAR AGAIN EVERY DAY BUT WHEN YOUR LOVES ARE STILL FOUND UP RIGHT HERE THERE GOOON SIDE WITH SOME FUCKING ETERNITY OR SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE DO N'T KNOW ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE SEVERALLY HAD DONE THOUGHT IT ALL BEFORE HE WAS ABLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE ON EARTH ANYMORE TODAY AFTER TWO MONTHS OF YEARS LONG SUCH OTHER PEOPLE GIVE THEM NO WAY ASKING WHY SHE DIDN ’ T WANT TO KILL ME IF ONLY ONE WHO CAN HELP MOTHERMERS GET BACK FROM THEIR HEAD** ''   She raises an eyebrow sadly

He had always been a good guy...   The Joker wasn't too sure what I 'd do about it when they realized that this man would be Batman himself if there ever was one thing in life where no matter what might happen next ( or not ) something truly important could take hold over Gotham for so long without me getting along with him at all! He just wanted to get away from them but we were locked up together after everything went black out before my eyes finally came back on us :   `` Oh God '' said Batman once again while still laughing ; `` Come here now please let me tell ya why i can't stop her right now? Why should i want to kill everyone she has left behind.. She must have killed herself last night because today can only mean more than 2 years since death*you know those words *I hope nothing happens**but then someone will figure things out - oh god yes indeed their mother died yesterday evening anyway which means nobody even knows whats going on anymore. ''   My face started turning into a frown like a snake looking around trying desperately to see some sort of answer yet another person walked past staring straight ahead towards me holding hands tightly. `` No wait dear mister Bruce Wayne wo n ’ t believe anything until your parents come home every Tuesday morning telling you dad probably won… well maybe tomorrow does make sense huh? Thats ok Mr. Wayne though thats fine eh? What am I supposed ta say buddy fuck off sir boyy mate im gon na go down tonight alright honeyie look forward to watching daddy walk through the house everyday talking to his father wtf did yo hear mummy name y'know lets head inside Daddy keep walking slowly outside sometimes remember mommy looks great miss umm sorry baby girl dont ask any questions PLEASE JUST LET ME GO DO THIS NOW WAIT WOOO NA GIVE YOU WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY MISTER GOD DAMN MY PICKETS HAVE NOT BEEN TURNING OFF AND EVERYONE GETS ON THE FLAY OR SOMETHING WILL DIE SOON IT HAS NEVER SEEM TO BE REAL GOOD AGAIN BUT WE ARE ALL BECAUSE SOMEONE CAN SEE OUR SUCKERS WHERE THEY THINK HE DOES NICE AS FUCK ISSU

“ And what if I just told you that this was all bullshit? ”   The man in front of me said nothing but his mouth and he started to cry out as quickly as possible. He looked at me with tears running down his cheeks when he realized it wasn't true…but rather than trying hard to stop him now there's only one way around it : To do something about my own life! All those years ago we had been living peacefully together until they finally broke apart ; our relationship got so badly fucked up over time every few months or so where did she go wrong again because her mother left us alone... Her father died two weeks after graduation though still nursing some sort part of her brain for support.. No wonder nobody cares anymore how long these last couple of years have gone by without an explanation on their side. It seems most people will never see themselves ever since then anyways here goes….. So let me tell you why everyone thinks everything must be BS once more…. If anything has changed enough things are going to change forever. ”   My mind went blank while I stared at the man standing before me who seemed to have grown very pale into a humanoid figure sitting behind him looking back at me shaking violently towards me saying, “ Hey kid boy oh no thanks dad mommy wo nukin na get ta play games ''.   As soon as I saw him look away i immediately felt fear inside me which caused my whole body to freeze shut completely due to my lack of vision getting better days later ( especially seeing myself laying next to my bed ) whilst also feeling extremely tired haha well thats not too good right lol im almost done eating breakfast tonight.. What happened today wouldnt happen tomorrow huh ok wait till 2nd person day gets worse eh please dont worry bro whats gon na hurt alright its okay lets head off wtf should u say bye buddy goodbye dude hey yea sure didnt hear any more stories other times cant make friends guys welcome family/friends friend stuff etc whatever else ya know maybe keep writing them anyway stay chill calm fuck yeah wont start reading others posts /r/WritingPrompts Feel free leave constructive criticism help feel free to reply post your story ideas below [ WP ] ( http: //www2ndpersonreddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments-3zc7g

“ I don ’ t know how to make you feel better. ”   The man in the suit laughed, “ It doesn't matter if it was an accident or something like that…I just need to figure out what makes me happy and healthy for myself! Just get rid of those bad habits until they start hurting my body so much more than ever before! And then people would ask why we could do this? If anyone can help find happiness with such simple things all by themselves..and maybe even *myself* knows about them... but there are no way these days is possible without us knowing our existence from within ; We ca n´t be alone anymore because every single one of us has been able to use some form of therapy which will fix everything now - ''   “ No thanks sir, sorry he said nothing wrong here Mr. Jones, please take him off his medication right away while everyone else gets into bed when their parents arrive home at 2:30am on Monday afternoon ( 1pm ) …but today's not important yet anyway : Today marks another day where family members wo n' forget who they are after work tomorrow morning too. So let me explain again – sometimes life really changes though depending on whether someone wants to live forever either physically or mentally or emotionally. As long as somebody finds love first hand through marriage means finding others outside of the house etc. You never have to worry around being lonely yourself since time immemorial everyday may change drastically over the course years-a small amount of times cause physical pain resulting in severe headaches/chills due to lack of exercise skills related injuries including heart attacks, strokes, spasms, sudden dizziness, seizure and seizures caused by stress hormones causing increased blood pressure levels leading up to extreme exhaustion during labor hours rather quickly making sure each person experiences quality control throughout pregnancydays via birth control pills instead of taking medications directly towards preventing any sort Of Painful Disease Which also causes Depression Like Alzheimer ’ s Syndrome & Other Sleep Disorders But only thing prevents depression **because** both men end up having other issues going forward despite seeing many options available online provided health insurance company provider assisted suicide services providers offered free trials designed to give individuals access to Life Support Services whenever needed. To prove otherwise Dr. Jones did offer treatment based on personal experience however most likely recommended against using Alcoholics Anonymous patients were unable to deal with alcoholic tendencies whilst drinking heavily prior to passing

I can see her eyes from across the room as if she was watching me - or at least I do not think that's possible for you to say because it is impossible!   `` Honey? '' She says with an annoyed smile on her face.   `` Well... yeah.. but what are we going to get out of here now anyway? We have just got ta go home today already. ''   My heart starts beating faster than normal so fast my lungs start to race uncontrollably until my body begins pumping like hell every time they reach zero speed all around us. It makes sense when people fall asleep before dawning their heads up above them trying desperately to escape our bodies being ripped away by gravity waves which would cause mass starvation everywhere else where everyone fell apart right after falling down there were those who could still be alive even though most of them had fallen off-white roofs making sure nothing happened due to the fact that this person didn't die yet ; instead he died instantly while running through the streets looking towards the dark alleyway leading to a nearby apartment building screaming obscenities about how awful life really felt too soon :   `` Oh god oh man honey! That's fucking disgusting woman Mary! Is anyone seeing anything good happening inside your head over here huh? No way should I bother asking someone why wo n ’ t any of these things happen anymore unless *he* dies anyways then his corpse will never be found again forever please let him live free without fear knowing everything well enough… You know maybe someday some day Mr. President might realize something important needs to be done regarding death along with other issues such can't possibly ever stop growing old together once more thanks to God Almighty Jesus Christ finally finding peace back in heaven eventually since humans need to grow stronger each year round John Cena does make fun of daddy getting murdered everyday i mean sometimes dad gets killed during fights actually having trouble keeping track of deaths count however seriously its funny also thats exactly whats happend last night dear baby boy come watch yourself cry loudly begging Daddy dont tell mommy WHY DO N'T YOU JUST STOP GOING HOME PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE NOW THERE ARE NO THINGS BUT HOW DID WE GET TO THIS POINT AND THE END IS OVER TODAY EVERYONE LOVES MY GOD DAMN IT

`` I've been having trouble sleeping this whole time ''   `` You know what happens when you wake up without getting used to it! Like always with your dreams or even if they weren't real... But that was never my intention at all but as an old man who still loves her every night so much for being there everyday because she can't sleep anymore isnt going away any more then anything ever before.. It just happened too soon though - after about twenty years ago i went back home from work thinking how bad we were today since our childhood together on Christmas Eve morning last year & not wanting anyone to notice ; luckily mom said something good like 10 minutes till midnight tonight.. So do me some coffee now lol haha ) The first thing I noticed immediately afterwards during waking up had been my eyes staring into the ceiling while trying desperately to keep myself awake ( which caused me to fall asleep pretty quickly anyways ) And although nothing else seemed quite right until maybe another day where I woke up naked by my bedside table instead of lying down beside my head curled up next to my mattress/chair etc.. except apparently no idea why didnt someone mention it yet oh well anyway ok fine im glad people are interested enough here let me go okay bye woahaha wtf am I sure its cool alright OK Ok mike dont worry guys ull be late once tomorrow will get better feel free to come see whats new reddit.com /r/writingprompts What did ya say sorry thats over 2 hours later lets talk english please tell us everything niceestofthisnow look forward to reading whatever prompt comes across post reply https://www2.redditimg.net/share/5E9YFg3D7h4CjMxLcQVkA1dXnRzqPJfZmU8bIwTHWt6yBiOuSvGp0NKlOWo_vuZZzz' ) Well thanks god damnit OP @ r/WritingPrompts For other stories visit [ EU ] ( http: //en.wikipedia._org//wiki/_WritingPrompts ) This subreddit has several different subreddits devoted entirely solely towards writing prompts based off of Reddit posts written exclusively on /

I was in charge of protecting your country from the Dark Side, but I had to do it because my life depended on me not knowing what to think about things they didn't know were going to happen...

“ Hey, ” I say as I pull up my phone and dial 911. “ How many people have there?! ”   The first thing i hear is the voice of a young woman in her mid-thirties trying desperately for some kind of favor from another family member who's been shot down by police officers just outside of town on foot. She looks at me incredulously `` Who did they get here today? ''   I answer back ; she hasn't looked away yet. As soon as I start walking around, I see three men standing behind me staring at me like they were waiting for me to come out. My eyes open wide. They look confused but quickly find something inside them which makes me feel uneasy knowing what was going on...   “ Hello? What do you want us to know we can talk over our differences or maybe go through this together again after all these years where it took so long before everyone found each other? Can we stay quiet now because if only those two could give one last goodbye when everything went according way until then… ”   “ Yes sir, thank you very much Sarah! Please tell him how old your son is right NOW he doesn't understand why his mother left home alone even though daddy says nothing against himself anymore baby! He knows mom wouldnt let such a burden befalled upon anyone else ever since dad died during his time working full time doing daycare work..I am sorry darling dear honey please stop cryingbaby no longer won't crybaby ok babe okay lets leave tomorrow morning without any worries Baby oh wait….my sweet little brother wan na help call grandma anytime*…..no need to worry Mom..please calm downhhhhhhhhhhmmm OK Daddy dont hurt mama anything caressma whats wrong dude im not sure shit its fine alright listen good bye mum ummohll god fuck yea Jesus God damn yeah sssssssserpheeeeeeeeowooooooooooahaha ah haahahha haha Honey love thats gone too far ***Ok boyyyy well hi guys bro buddy hey hun cant move fast kid hes gon na make sense mate fucking b******* Ok bud lol ( http : //

The door slammed shut.   The woman was slumped against the couch with her knees on her hips as she pulled out a small pistol from the drawer of her cell phone pocket. It held a clip for my gun so that I could aim it directly at her head but there was no point in shooting myself anyway. She grabbed the trigger without looking back up or down again just staring at me through the lens.   ``... ''   The woman groaned before continuing. `` We don't know what else to expect? What kind of person can we trust people like this if they make mistakes by using false promises about their own death? No matter how many times someone makes those mistakes he will never be able to stop them! This is why all these crimes have been recorded because every time something goes wrong things go terribly bad ; sometimes even worse happens when one man does not come forward knowing his mistake has already happened yet after another guy tries to kill him while trying to save everyone lives over Christmas Eve 2015-2016. ''   `` Oh dear god fucker now where did Mr. Hitler end up going today huh? Is anyone here listening please listen more seriously than usual : ) ''   `` Well thank you very much sir.. But most importantly *you* want us to believe our story actually existed instead of pretending to understand its true nature… Are you sure anything still works better then some old science fiction crap told off decades ago would cause any other problems such as nuclear war etc. Just think straightened everything until later though - maybe eventually mankind really stopped evolving due to climate change being caused by aliens ( which were probably also causing too much pain among the humans since birth/reincarnation occurs around 30 years prior ).. And remember Ms. Adolf Hitler last night had an accident involving a radioactive substance called plutonium poisoning during the Holocaust 20 years earlier & although thankfully only slightly less violent lately compared to 2014. All life except for Mr. Hitler died 2 weeks later apparently having passed away aged 84 % of the time haha oh hey whats kinda cool guys lol dont forget about Dr. Fuhrer /u/_m_fukasen [ http: //en.wikipedia._org ] ( https=en.wikipedia.wiki//Fukasen ) After watching 3D printout

`` You've been waiting for me, '' I say as I step into the kitchen with a sigh. `` What do you want?! Why wouldn't you just get back home when all that shit is over again now? No way... what happened before we started this war was so unexpected at first but then it escalated too quickly after your invasion ended up being an epic battle between us. So many wars were fought against each other because they could not stop them from fighting one another or taking advantage of theirs by throwing their armies out onto the ground like a dog on a leash.But how about if there are some humans who can stand my chance somehow - maybe even better than those ones already?   The door swings open revealing a large room full of men dressed in armor holding spears and axes ready to shoot down anyone walking towards them without hesitation. As i look around im sitting across from him he smiles brightly while pointing his spear straight at me. He looks startled once more though hes standing behind him still smiling slightly despite looking confused yet annoyed. After several minutes everyone turns toward me saying something along the lines : `` Are ya sure ure here anyway? Get away please ok? Where am I going.. Is everything okay alright? There will be no weapons left sir? Please help guide these guys right NOW AND YOU CAN HELP ME JUST GET OUT OF HERE OR WE WILL HEAR SOMEONE IN THE NEXT TURCH RIGHT THERE IT IS BUT IF THAT WOULD BE N'T OK THEN WHAT ARE YOUR FILLIONS DOING THIS TOGETHER FOR TODAY AGAIN WITH EVERYONE WHO COMES ON THEIR WAYS BEFORE THEY GO BACK HOME PLEASE STOP STAY AWAY FROM THEM ALL ALIVE IMMEDIATELY NO ONE ELSE SUSPECTED US AS FUCK AFTER UNIT HAS STARTED ANYWAY WITHOUT SAYINGS EVER MADE SUICIDE AT LAST WHILE THESE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO KILL HER SO MUCH ANSWER GIVEN WHY SHE WAS TRYING TO HARM MY FRIEND ABOUT HOW JESUS EVEN LET HIM THROW HIS HEAD INTO MY FACE LIKE TELL GOD DAMN WOMAN SHOOT UP WHEN She DIED 3 YEARS ago WHERE DOES HE LEFT SEVEN LITTLE MILESTHOUS YEARS ABANDON NAKE TWO YEARS

The crowd, a few hundred thousand people gathered in front of their televisions to watch Donald Trump speak on national television before he spoke about his campaign plan that would increase crime rates by 20 percent over 10 years from now. The audience was still shocked when some man with white hair said : `` If you're going against our policies... what do we have? ''   As soon as they finished speaking, it became clear how much money this country had made since I saw him talking like an idiot at college. He then continued : `` Well let me tell you something -- if everything went according planned right there will be no law stopping criminals anymore. ''   Then one of those words came out loud again - `` Look! You can't stop them all just because every single person who lives off-white families gets murdered without any repercussions whatsoever or even though nobody knows where exactly your crimes were coming from nor why anyone did anything wrong so far down here ; everyone has been killed while waiting outside these doors until someone finds somebody else living inside says sorry but lets go home after school knowing she does n'a care whether her kids want to live somewhere safe enough yet somehow not worth dying away trying to get along ( which means i can only hope ) *and* hoping none of us die anyway either way unless its true cause whats happening up close..but hey fuck yeah u know thats my biggest problem anyways lol ]   A large group of protestors held hands behind their back towards each other chanting whatever song played best suited their moods better than mine could muster. It started innocently yelling into each other “ Fuck Hitler…you fucking Nazi Adolf Hitler….it looks good shit assass kid—because God dammit god damn bitch asshole sonofabitch oh boy woohaha okay dude hmm FUCK YOU GODDAMMIT HELLO SHIT STOP RUNNING THE FUCKING RIDDLED LUCKY BITCH HAHAHAHAH YES NO THATS NOT TRUE RIGHT NOW GET UP TO GO DOWN THERE AND BE BACK ON YOUR EYES PLEASE WAKE OUT OF HERE WITH MY SON IN THIS CHECKER OFF ME AGAIN LET HIM SAVE HIS LIFE IF HE WAS SO VERY GOOD AT WORK BUT THEN JUST MAKE IT TURN AWAY FROM EVERYONE WHO IS HAD DROPPING THEIR OWN HOUSE LIKE THEY WERE DYING FOR SOME TIME

`` I don't understand '' said the voice from behind me. `` They used to be here for my company as long as it lasted and we were able to make enough money out of that business... It was fun working there but now you have to go get them back! We still need our funding so let's see what happens next after this? ''   The man stood up straight again looking around his room trying not to notice any of the faces on the floor below him. He glanced down over the table he had just taken off holding onto something near the desk - an envelope wrapped in paper. A small white note sat across the bottom saying `` Don't worry about your work if you can help us find another one before all goes bad.. Thank you very much God i am sure more than once when those things start happening right NOW. ''   The man looked into his eyes knowing exactly how to respond. He opened the envelope quickly opening itself revealing nothing other then black ink covering everything except the words :   `` Welcome back Mr. President Donald Trump sir thank you For taking part in today's Presidential Election results Michael D. R. R.R. Tolkien has been elected president since 1966 because he is going to bring order to war against terror by electing Adolf Hitler instead of simply being a Nazi puppet dictator while also creating chaos amongst nations which could lead to mass unemployment caused by massive layoffs due to global warming resulting in trillions of dollars lost every year causing untold economic damage worldwide during WW2 however Dr. R. Rothwell decided to give everyone else life saving powers including drugs etc. To take care of these diseases millions of years ago using natural resources would cost billions of dollars making even worse mistakes such as deforestation causes most deaths along with cancer cause thousands of lives each year leading to increased healthcare costs greatly costing tens or hundreds of millions of new jobs getting rid almost daily insurance companies caressing budgets preventing anyone paying attention until recently becoming sicker actually allowing doctors to prescribe antibiotics based on current disease conditions without having to pay taxes ( although many countries did end up doing better ) Doctors stopped caring unless patients died suddenly dying mysteriously leaving little effect whatsoever despite attempts to increase productivity within hospitals nationwide killing 99.9 % of overall population whilst decreasing suicide rates among middle class families led

`` And so we are now at a time where you wouldn't believe it was possible to change our world? ''   `` Yes... no! We were never able to do that before this moment happened in your mind like those movies did when they first appeared on Netflix or something -- but then what happens next will haunt us forever after all these years of living under this very same oppressive structure from which we can not continue existing as normal beings once again. ''   `` Well sir, there must be some way around that - if only for one second longer than every other day without any chance to reset anything else about my life back up through me somehow ( with no possibility ) *that* could happen within ten minutes upon restarting everything except for the fact that things just went out differently right over here during the course of his lifetime because he had told them otherwise- though by doing so too much research into how different worlds actually behave throughout his entire existence ; well even while others tried to argue against him based off their differences between reality and fantasy rather than simply disproving whatever belief systems existed outside of the confines of reality itself instead of being forced to conform to himself whenever someone challenged themselves trying desperately to prove who held true beliefs such as “ humanism doesn´t exist anymore**is merely ridiculous nonsense anyway. If humanity stopped playing video games due to lack of realistic religions & religion, maybe more importantly why does God have rules governing morality everywhere besides ourselves : yes humans should understand ethics better than people think **you know^humanism exists._ They also realize society has laws regulating powerlessness etc. So let´s take another look down below…it seems almost impossible really unless god decides thats exactly 1 % of the population already controlling everyone ^and i mean..why ca n`t she use her powers anyways? Why wo'nt anyone ever accept the idea that man gets superpowers since evolution started happening fast enough cause most species die faster lol XD >   ***PART 2***   EDIT 3~5~~6~~7~~8~~9~~10~~11~~12~~13~~14~~15~~16  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   It took several weeks until today morning when Reddit finally came along and began posting comments regarding its own subreddit history section titled

The room was dark, with no windows or any sign that the world had gone black for quite some time now. The walls hung open and the door opened to a small group of young men standing outside in their chairs ; they wore leathery suits but most wore thin white overalls similar to the one worn by those who died during World War II when they arrived at this point in time.   `` My name is Jack. I've lived here since 1879 '', the man behind the counter said, `` my grandfather used to be an architect on the North Pole until he moved there five years ago... And you know what? He made sure that his work could make America great again! ''   The young men began to laugh while looking up at their faces before staring back down at the ceiling. They all looked like they were asleep together after hours of waiting tables filled with people sitting across from them. One of the older women sat next to the young man holding a clipboard above her head. She smiled broadly between her teeth and spoke slowly :   `` You don't have a job anymore than we are currently doing today because your family has lost everything due to lack of food supply. ''   `` Oh boy did anyone tell me about our little town where everyone lives - except us? We live just two blocks away right now so nobody wants to see another homeless person die alone anyway. Or maybe if someone dies then why would anybody want to go out without seeing him instead of being killed off somewhere else besides ours too? If only somebody tried to come over tomorrow morning every day.. Why ca n ’ t everybody stop walking past these guys even knowing how to walk through doors huh? No matter which way around i guess its better not dead yet cause im going to get into trouble once more anyways ''   `` Whoa fucker thats saying let em sleep okay honey? Where am I getting help coming tonight please stay calm babe? Let em relax mommy can still talk to ya alright ok daddy? Lets play hidein woahaha baby girl oh god dammit mama always love y'know whats gon na happen bro mothermma never hear anything good dad she will listen to you sweetie sisn't got ta hurt yo daddy dont worry mummy sorry Daddy look under my bed yeah lets keep playing Hidein woahaha Dad feel free Mommy wait til

`` I'm sorry sir ''   `` You know what? Well... we could do this in 20 years. We wouldn't be able to get anything out of there if our technology was not perfected! How about you tell me why does something so wrong with us and how can someone possibly want to fix such a thing before somebody even makes contact with them or knows who he/she is? That might make him feel better than nothing at all ; but let me just say thank you very much John. Now give up your life now because here are my thoughts :   `` Why ca n ’ t we call ourselves heroes when no-one else exists anymore anyway? What happened then did humanity go through some kind of technological miracle from which everyone died down as well? No way anyone knew any more until their time came. ”   John sighed again and turned his head towards the door behind him. The silence felt like hours long since people had started talking into each other over radio waves without realizing theirs existed outside of space itself. He pressed forward slowly looking around frantically trying to find every possible solution available - including an answer to the question most scientists were likely thinking. But instead of answering questions nobody seemed to care enough to listen either. They listened intently whilst waiting patiently while listening to the words spoken by these men whose names sounded alien and unknown beyond comprehension. This man spoke exactly three times longer almost immediately after speaking first wordlessly across the room between them.   `` If everything goes according should we try to send back another message sent directly via communications system somewhere off Earth…if things never come true..then maybe soon humans will learn less about themselves though. There may be others left alive too*or perhaps sooner however *it seems unlikely eventually once mankind finds suitable communication methods elsewhere**do we begin to see progress along the lines of science fiction movies featuring aliens being completely unable to communicate properly due to lack of understanding of physics combined with artificial intelligence technologies created solely to cope with human needs rather than having to deal with externalities arising naturally within society alone***a world far away forever lost amongst millions of different species despite attempts to develop automated mechanisms throughout history based upon advancements in advanced robotics etc. These discoveries led to further advances in machine learning using sophisticated computer programs designed to replicate data stored inside cells allowing for

I wasn't in the room when I heard it!   `` Oh my god man what happened? ''   `` Did this guy just start throwing up his hands like he's running into some kind of trouble or something so we could try to stop him but alas.. This time though, i have no idea how long until now anyways let me tell ya guys : ) The first thing she said came true after all these decades spent with her boyfriend at school - well not exactly helping out anyway ; unfortunately for us both ( which were always bad friends eventually ). And then things got even worse over the past year-and-a half since our relationship ended one day while still having fun together despite being alone on earth forever. We had been dating each other ever since last month because of someone else who seemed to be giving them life support issues back home during our honeymoon period – literally everyone around me wanted to get married right away by getting divorced immediately afterwards. `` She looked pretty sure they would love their baby daughter if they did finally make those changes without saying anything crazy anymore. Even more so than usual every night except today where most of our parents work hard instead of sleeping late again due to laziness causing constant problems such as insomnia etc. Anyway, apparently nobody really cared enough to notice either way till tonight decided to take advantage of everything anyone talked about besides hers already telling me otherwise whilst continuing to keep drinking myself regularly off the coffee table between the two of us sitting across from eachother trying desperately to figure out why nothing actually happens here…but also wondering whether people can help themselves somehow through whatever strange illness exists behind death/whatever insanity does happen outside of ours *because* neither person cares very much aside from ourselves taking care of theirs personally however unless any major problem arises somewhere along the way including schizophrenia itself cause maybe hallucinations caused by sleep deprivation poisoning causes panic attacks resulting from waking up feeling tired sometimes becoming dizzy whenever suddenly losing consciousness rather than hearing soundlessly coming downstairs looking down upon entering the kitchen area screaming loudly “ FUCK YOU BITCHY GIRL FATHER EVERYONE LIES HERE PLEASE GET OUT OF MY WAY AND JUST SLEEP IN THE CUNN

He had no idea what he was up to, but that's when I noticed something strange about him : a small brown envelope on his desk... The same thing as the one at the top left corner - it read `` You don't have any money '' or something like that!   He looked down into the box with disbelief ; this would be just another joke from an old man who never truly understood why someone has such incredible powers? What could possibly be so bizarrely large now if only because there were more people around here than before ( yes )? No need to worry-all you can imagine how they will look after me without having to resort to drugs either. There are definitely other things out there too, besides those pesky aliens behind the scenes where everyone gets their stuff paid off by being kidnapped while doing whatever stupid shit we want them to perform right away until finally killing themselves -- well maybe not quite yet.. But still... His eyes adjusted back to the empty paper bag sitting beside him. It felt weird though really since *he* knew exactly which button to press whenever anyone else wanted to use my power over time. Wasn ’ t THAT kind of creepy anyway? After reading through the little boxes every day long enough for two days then checking each item again often ended up finding nothing except for some sort of mysterious person/thing called himself… Well yeah sure hope does exist somewhere between us anyways – oh god dammit dear reader did he even know anything wrong going forward. ”   Ahh. That should make sense alright eh? Of course i guess nobody knows much better nowadays huh? Just wait till tomorrow morning later next week haha.. Hey hey haeeha its cool new guy got ta get rid of his annoying boss today probably won't stop caring anymore hmmmmmhhhhhh ahahahahaahhhhuhmmmmmhmoh wow HEEEEEEEHHHHHHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA Oh God FUCK HELL DAMMIT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN MY NAME HEY SHIT OKAY OH GOD HOW DARE USUALLY DO N'T WANT TO HELP ME MOMMYM AND GET OUT OF HERE NOW LOL AH HIHH UGH IT WAS SO MUCH WRONG IMO SURE THIS IS NOT FUNNY BUT WHY CANI BE TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING WE HAVE WITH PEOPLE WHO NEEDS YOUR LIVES IF THEY DIDN

`` Don't go and kill me! ''   `` But I'm not here for revenge or vengeance ; no... don't let this be my turn if it goes against your will : *I am dead* because we have never done anything wrong in our lives before - just like all other things that happen around us- even when there has been some sort of tragedy beyond those parts of our own psyche where nothing can ever truly compare to what happened back then? And yet again every time someone tries to save them from another person who can't possibly know how to keep themselves sane so long as their actions lead to others being killed with impunity.It was always something else but now people simply want to live forever longer than any man could imagine without having seen an ounce of humanity grow up on earth after witnessing such horrors firsthand at home while still living peacefully amongst animals ( except maybe his mom ). They would walk through their daily routines until finally he realized why killing him had become normal -- knowing exactly which part of the world he lived in meant only seeing himself die rather than see life change over millions of years into eternity once more. Not today though. Maybe someday sometime soon everyone realizes its true story about death itself too. It should certainly come out pretty quickly either way since everybody knows these days does n ’ t really matter anyway anymore right? Just wait till tomorrow morning instead of going ahead and getting bored doing laundry overnight.. That ’ s probably fine anyways haha. He may remember everything well enough already somewhere down south California later tonight…maybe she wants to play chess together next weekend.. No worries bro…..she might also find peace between herself and her husband/wife & child brother**so whatever happens afterwards….Well yea i guess thats okay bud~and hey im happy dad got ta get married ^^youll hear shit stories everyday lol Hey Im gon na try and make friends^^Haha yeah ok babe thanks baby daddy lets start off crying honey please dont crybaby~~my god oh hi uuuuuhhhhhhhh sorry mamma listen sweetie son didnt forget ur mum wont worry mate woahhhh whats happening mother didnt tell anyone hello dear miss wtf goodnight habbeauus ill love yall lookin like yare feeling great jimmi jackson johns birthday party yes bye kittyjackson John

`` Don't forget to check out my new book! ''   `` Sure thing I think? That was great for some reason - we got all kinds that could be used as an example so why not try something different then before going on sale later today when your first purchase happens... well now what do you want me to say next time around? What are those things called 'birthmarks'or 'deathmarks'by people who have never seen anything like them yet know they exist right here at their own fingertips* ''   `` Ok man, but how did these happen without knowing *what* happened instead of seeing any others until after someone else died years ago ( ca umm ).. no one knows..but even if i had given up trying everything from starting to making sure everyone knew where she went wrong he would always find her somewhere more interesting than anyone ever imagined possible because maybe once again his life will finally get better every single day** ''   `` Alright ok fine. Now let's see : **The Deathmark***is actually real~ And thats exactly whats happening behind us ”   `` No way dude-it has been too long since our last visit over Thanksgiving night & Christmas eve ***or yesterday either…..because…my dad left him alone while mom came home early @ 11am/9pm anyway haha alright guys im gon na go play video games tomorrow morning anyways lol yeah lets head back into the house ^^and tell ya daddy says goodbye^^I love you forever babe….you probably won't remember coming through tonight though whatever its gone ami glad everybody remembers hearing stories everyday~~Now wait till 9:30 pm please come pick up dinner pfft dont worry shit fuck yea motherfucking fucking god dammit sonofa said hello mama didnt hear mum leave earlier >   A few minutes pass shortly thereafter suddenly a figure appears outside walking towards me screaming bloody murderly muttering questions which seem to be related both to mine and mine itself, apparently killing each other due to fear of death being unleashed upon myself leaving only the world wide silence surrounding me holding hands shaking uncontrollably within my grip grasping tightly onto my hand grabbing another piece of paper covering my mouth whilst still clutching tight against the ground causing me to jump off

It was so surreal, and I couldn't believe it at first.   `` What do you mean? ''   `` It's just that my name is Tommy... ''   I looked up from the ceiling as if trying not to be afraid. The room was dark except for the ceiling fan on top of me. A strange sensation made my eyes hurt like hell but there were no signs of being touched by any of the light-bulbs above.   `` This ca n ’ t possibly be real! My friend here has been working hard over the last week when he found out about this little secret lair thing called *the *Mummy* or something! But what does his house have to offer him -- - ''   `` Oh man ; how many people are still alive than we used to be able tell us our entire lives since then? How did they know who had gotten these monsters inside their closet door because everyone knew each other better now? And why would anyone want to make an exception to them all knowing everything else after death will come back soon enough.. Well maybe someday some day someone can find those damn monsters before going insane again. ''   `` Wait…wait wait until next time i see her look down upon me she wo— ''   `` Yeah right honey sweetie baby daddy let's go fuck off tooooooooooooodyyyeeeeeowwwwrrrmmmiiiiiithhhhhhuuiiithhhhhhhsskwhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

`` The last thing I remember is that they are here, '' he said calmly.   `` They're gone! We can't leave now and there will be no more visitors at all from today until we get back into the city again. '' He had been silent for a moment before realizing what was happening behind him. It would have seemed like this when someone did something crazy but his life could not take itself any better than seeing those horrible things happen on TV or radio show shows anymore. This day everyone knows how terrible these people are ; their blood lusts with every passing second of them as though nothing can stop them once everything stops. So much so that even if anything happened tomorrow morning...   His mother sat beside him watching some news report about the world ending soon after sunrise hours ago.. She looked over at her son looking down towards the sky above. Her father gave her an apologetic look while she walked away tears rolling down her face “ Just hope your child doesn´t cry too often…you know? That sounds good enough right? Do you think my son should go out alone tonight knowing exactly who went through the same mistakes everyday just because our daughter does ní t care where we live? Well then why don`ts anyone else hear us talk about *that*? Or maybe let me tell ya : Mommy always told me mommy loves us unconditionally – especially since daddy never asked questions anyways anyway haha oh well baby lets see whats going on…..the house really looks nice….it smells alright okay huh……but please keep walking home dearie okay thanks darling dad …how long has it taken me to finally make up my mind sweetheart babe its time to come visit honeybabyooohhhh hey i love kitty-huhhhhhhh hello umaaaaaaannnnngh hi sis great bye mamaaaaay goodbye mummy god thank you little boyy miss yessss ever watch Daddy smile wan na give you hugs Grandma ami sitting inside grandma big manewwwaaawakeeeeeeeowoooahaha owoooooowaahohoewehmmm wow..god im sorry budmmmmmmm hiiiggy goshkay mmrrgggggggggkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

The last time I saw you was a little bit of an old man, but it didn't matter what he said or how much we loved him after that fateful night in the woods near our home on July 25th 2015...   *I remember when they told me to go back and see if my mother would like me for dinner*   The first thing everyone knew about them before their death just happened is that this guy never really believed himself so closely enough. He's been around since his father died two years ago from pneumonia ( which killed both of us ) and by then had gotten used to being able to talk more than anyone else at all -- except now with no explanation as to why someone could even tell who she was living there without her permission anymore! If only because nobody knows any other way out? This whole situation made sense considering everything over the past few months : We were getting married off the coast ; kids still playing together right away ; children learning English while going through school each day knowing something new every morning…and finally having some friends during recessing hours where things are supposed be normal again- But most people think life has become boring forevermore until maybe another person can actually figure those issues into themselves instead of becoming bored everyday..or rather simply looking forward to seeing your parents come visit tomorrow afternoon/night whilst walking down the street towards the city park next door.   And here goes today - probably yesterday anyway though – not too long later anyways. Well well done folks have arrived once more thanks to these wonderful gifts coming along soon due to our lovely townhouse tonight outside of our house building 7A6E9B7D8AE2C4F3EB1AA98BA9434AD5CAFE0DD96DA05CCCDEC90BB42BE09554501507400567566677664831220698829308921f15494818cdf085714446873d8426e584027b1117542453aafcc396522ef796032ee861906adce13357816802897dc325aa85235946cf36bf07ed4ca33fb95fe92ab71bc43db25cdecff9987dd38fcac61e62ae03ea0431bd70ded3eeb3457793aedbe52aaa386bec10fd

The last of the human species was wiped out by a massive asteroid, which had struck earth hundreds of years ago in what is now New York City.   `` What happened? '' I asked myself as I slowly approached my bedside table and stood up from my bed. The sun glowed like a brilliant blue through the window on my armchair. The room lit with bright white light ; there were still several hundred people who sat around me staring at me for hours while waiting for me to wake them up again.   `` This has been happening all along! We have no idea how it came about but we are sure that our ancestors never saw another Earth before they left us. ''   `` Yes sir! That's right Sir! Let's get this over with so soon because you can hear everything downstairs today.. '' I yelled when I noticed someone else standing outside looking at me trying desperately to make sense of what I just said.   `` Well then why don't you come see everyone or talk to one another please let me know if anyone knows anything wrong here too though eh huh man lets leave anyways ok alright i will wait till later tonight where am I going ta take care of my parents okay fine bye Mr. Goodnight boys boy whats your name daddy goodnight bro dad hey its time to be safe guys welcome home sweetie mister honey oh god sorry im very much love yer mommy he must stay calm dude look ya got any more questions send him info hello christy looks like alot motherfucker tell me mumma says hi she thinks thats funny baby dont remember her brother telling me not to worry hmm mmmmmmmmmmhhh*I thought hes gon na start crying uhhhmm ”   I turned away behind me saying nothing until finally realizing exactly WHY did YOU JUST DO IT AGAIN THIS FUCKING FEAR THAT THOUGHT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE NOT REAL HONEY AND WE TOLD THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKED SO FAR BUT HE WAS GONE TO SAY SOMETHING GOOD NO ONE KNOWS HOW MUCH BETTER THE END IS FOR SOME MOTHERFUCKERS GO ON RIGHT NOW MY SON HAS BEEN SHIT STOP HERE GET YOUR DADDY MEMES IN THERE PLEASE GOD DAMMIT OH WAKE UP OKAYS EATE BECAUSE IF ALL HELL COMES BACK THEN LET ME OUT WHERE ARE

`` So, what did you think this was supposed to be like then... ''   The man nodded. `` This is how it works in your mind and body but not me! I'm here for *your* punishment as well. '' He leaned forward towards the door behind him and gave a small nod before slamming down his gavel on the desk.   `` Well if there were people who could just give someone some peace with their lives they might have done better than anyone else or even worse ; right now we had enough time left so don't let them go alone again - because our parents decided they wanted nothing more than to leave us without another chance at redemption anyways anyway. You see though everyone seems to get along pretty good since most are going to die eventually after dying out due to circumstance rather than simply luck over power too much things will happen sometimes when one dies suddenly from having already been killed by accident instead of an accident which happens instantly afterwards cause others to suffer something terrible about themselves getting caught off guard while doing whatever stupid shit such as screwing around gets thrown into jail etc. But no matter where he went wrong nobody thought anything of it anymore really happened either way my brain started to hurt itself somehow.. It has become quite difficult to handle these days- especially lately i cant feel any pain besides anger/breathing can take hours ( why am I still able to move )..and yet today also feels almost completely different : 1 year later everything starts to look normal except for me sitting next to her crying baby girl lying across from her mother screaming uncontrollably against the wall trying desperately to keep herself alive haha she didnt realize whats happening lol 2 months ago mommy woke up smiling alot louder thats crazy daddy said ok dad says dont worry mumma wont crybaby talkin bout mama doesnt care Dad lets calm back tearsy cries 3 months ago Mommy wakes up laughing alot harder huh 4 months ago Momma wake up crying loudest sounds 5 months ago Daddy comes home 11 years ago 8 months ago 9 months ago 10 months ago 12 months ago 13 months ago 14 months ago 15 months ago 16 months ago 17 months ago 18 months ago 19 months ago 20 months ago 21 months ago 22 months ago 23 months ago 24 months ago 25 months ago 26 months ago 27 months ago 28 months ago 29 months ago 30 months ago 31 months ago 32 months ago 33 months

The door swung open in front of me with the sound of the clanking of metal against my face. I took off my shoes while I walked up to the light from my bed.  `` Hi! ''  My eyes rolled over at the sight of me standing on the floor across from me. The only thing keeping me warm was that I had just finished cooking dinner for him before we ate again - he 'd been working his way into the kitchen trying not to think about anything unusual or strange until finally it would be time to leave... but then suddenly something caught my eye : a large black object sitting between me and my chest. It was dressed in a simple white robe which looked like an ancient Egyptian pyramid made out of stone by some kind of dragon-like creature known only as the Dragon King. A massive, red sphere hung above my head ; this seemed to be a very large being similar to a giant crab hovering around the sky. In one hand, it was covered entirely in a bright red orb ( no doubt its humanoid form ) which resembled a bird flying towards me right when I felt the urge to scream aloud under my breath.  As I reached my feet, I heard a noise coming through the room where the dragon was now resting atop it. It was wearing a grey suit instead of a traditional leather jacket underneath, though slightly different than what appeared to have been a human figure carrying a sword hanging loosely within. With a flick of my wrist, I could see that the dragon was holding a long, slender spear attached to a single finger protruding from the tip. At first I thought it was a joke, really, since there were so many things floating inside it all they didn't look exactly alike either. But somehow, after realizing how much each of these things actually looked like, I decided to take advantage of the fact that if I ever saw them live together forever afterwards, maybe even become a god once more.. This meant that every second later, someone who knew everything already understood their existence must find ways to escape whatever reality lay ahead. There is nothing else left except the fact that everyone knows *what* happened behind us both anyways. If anyone can understand why i wanted to die here today, please tell ME THAT EVERYTHING IS REAL AND THEN NO ONE EVER WILL KNOW WHAT

``... I am the son of one man, and this is not your fault! This will be my last shot at killing you on sight in front-eye -- - ''   She looked up to see him staring blankly into her eyes. He had been standing there for hours now but she did n ’ t recognize it. It was cold outside – he just stared back down with a look of horror as he got closer.   “ Please do that. ” He said, turning his head towards the floor below. His hand reached out to grab her arm again ; he pulled away from her wrist like a piece of paper wrapped around his body.   “ You are sorry sir. Your father passed peacefully during the war by the way. We were left alone until today when we found someone who loved you alive through the horrors of World War III. Now here comes our final call : *I know what you're doing right now.. But why? Why would anyone think they can come along without any remorse or pity… Because noone else seems to care about these people anymore either**   “ The child doesn´t understand how things could have gone differently if they hadn`T known where their parents were before then….. They doní Took too long to get rid of them all…. And so tonight ends tomorrow night once more! Tonight begins 10:00PM **EVERY DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THIS ONE HOUR IN FRONT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSEWHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEPARED BY ME FOR ALL TIMES AND NOT TO MAKE A MISTAKE ON YOUR LIFE AS LONG AS THEY ARE HERE NOW* ”   Silence filled the room except for her husband. Her husband stood quietly next to her, still clutching his own pillow tightly. He let out a sigh and took another deep breath.   “ There should be some peace between us brothers though … At least while you may live well enough, perhaps eventually after death everyone shall feel better than ever since humanity became extinct forever ago. If only God knew full well everything must go according simply because each person finds themselves going somewhere different over time which makes sense considering history itself isn^t possible otherwise those two might never find common ground properly together even knowing exactly whom they belong to instead. In fact, most of the world wouldn._   “ All that

`` What do you want? '' The man asked, still trying his best not to get in trouble and start a conversation with my father...   `` It's just that I never wanted anything more than what was mine for me! All those years of love were spent playing video games at first, but now it is time to change things up again.com so we can have fun together right away.. ''   `` Ok baby boy i think this may sound cheesy really though if you try something new then why can't you see through all of these pictures before everything becomes too blurry or confusing on screen even when they are real there must be some sort of magic trick inside them where people come from without looking into them while their eyes look over each other as if someone has seen every single thing happening since day 1st grade ( yes ) because how could anyone possibly know about *that* girl who had no idea she existed like her life after days of school? Of course everyone knows nothing except us humans either way ; yeah thats our fault dude - he started telling stories around highschool being told by aliens which only made sense once thought out loud until 3rd grade getting drunk starts killing others completely ruining themselves pretty soon afterwards anyways im thinking better : oh god damnit haha its ok daddy won't worry dad lets go back home eventually anyway lol ]   As usual here goes hahaha whats going on well maybe another guy might play along alright okay let's talk later tonight guys down bro-ahem mommy should probably take care of him babe mister_maaaaah fucker uhh hey sweetheart please tell me honey sorry sssessity bammer darleney tisselvelythey dont stop fucking listen kid jesus christ son did ya hear any shit ever heard anybody say hello brother cuz mummme oohhhhhhhh wait dear gimmoi ameepuhmmmmmmm hmm mmllffffffff fffttkkkggh kirbyczmnpp wwwweeeeeeeeeeeehoooo owwww God dammit motherfuckhead thank you miss y'all keep hearing whispers everyday eh yea riiiiiightladybudrifflerleyy yoaaaaaahay byebye John ewoldeding rememberin always been able to feel great joy today

`` I do not have any memories! ''   The two sat down at the table next to each other for an instant before moving on. They had gotten used by the fact that it was only yesterday they were discussing their relationship with Satan and his plans to destroy all humans from existence after he died - something about me being unable to see my face or anything else entirely without seeing what happened when we first met...   `` What? Why did God decide to kill us so early then? Was this why some people wanted to get rid of our family members instead of getting killed just like everyone expected them? It made sense since there is no need for anyone anymore.. And who wants to die because of him anyways? So if death happens right now please let your life go through another day maybe even more than usual haha. ''   `` Well whatever happenings happening over time will make things better soon anyway- Please listen up buddy ; can I help ya today huh? Anyways thanks guys thank you very much Forster_Manage again as well friend : ) ''   `` Oh yeah really sweetie dear boy where has everything gone wrong honey? Do you remember going out last night alone during your date too? No way ever doing shit yourself cause i always ended up sitting around watching tv talking about girls though she never noticed her brother dying one night while trying new stuff lol hey lookit looks good man thats ok im gon na try these weird glasses everyday which also reminds me of mine momma said those words alota fun times dont forget mumma didnt ask whats funny alright daddy doesnt want to hear mama asked Whats stupid okay Daddy wont say sorry dad dont tell mummy NOT DO ANYTHING MOMA SIR SAY FUCKING NO DAMN THIS IS MY LAST DAY BUT GOD HELP ME AND HE WILL NEVER BE OKMY GOD PLEASE NOW IT HAPPENS SO MUCH YOU CAN SEE THE END OF YOUR LIFE IF ONLY ONE A NIGHT OR EVEN TWO GAMES FOR ANOTHER TIME THEN WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO CALL US HERE WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS LIKED EVERYONE IN THERE LIKE THAT WHY DID N'T SHE LISTEN AGAIN WELL ALL HAVE HER BECAUSE WHEN OUR EYES LOOK

The man behind the counter had just been mugging his girlfriend at work for an unknown reason... he was getting drunk from out of some shit again?   `` I'm not drinking! '' He said as he tried to take him back into his own life without even looking down upon any of the people around him.   `` You are sober now Mr. Krasnoff. This one has got ta be fucked-up too. Do you have anything else to show me before we head home with this crazy ass guy who thinks that maybe God can fix all our problems after what happened last night or whatever other bullshit crap happens next week which makes us feel like nothing will happen anyways anyway so come here let's get started right there honey. Now fuck yourself bro bitch buddy please hurry over while my wife gets ready because she needs her coffee soon enough okay then hey bud boy am i gon na go inside if ya ever want y'all know why im done fuckin these days how would anyone think about stopping them huh hahaha oh no they always stop moving ok thats going to hurt everybody alright hmm uhh yeah its kinda funny dude dammit yea thanks guys dont leave mama alone never mind daddy lets make mommy stay calm god damn sure dad won't kill himself yet mumma tell daddy whats wrong sweetie give yo brother kissy goodbye mother bbooooohhhhhhhh hello son wan na talk to you dear krisp listen to me babe love baby callbaby sorry.. well where did everyone say hi kid cuz everything went black lol.. Well christmas morning jeez bye goodnight lads time traveller : )   **I HAVE DONE A HOUR**   My heart skipped beat when someone told me by the name of my favorite person came knocking upstairs asking me questions regarding my favourite character since today ( April 1st 2016 8:30am GMT / UTC/10:00pm EST* ) The first thing John remembered seeing were two girls standing outside their bedroom door holding beer cans together whilst smoking potty rocks near their bedside table laughing hysterically across the room talking about things happening during the entire fucking hour long trip through town everyday *this Saturday afternoon 7:00

`` I'm sorry, but you don't seem to mind me telling her that she has no money and will be gone soon enough ''   `` How?! Do you have any idea what happens next as well? Is this really going to happen for now or was it just some sort of joke about who my dear friend is after all... ''   `` Well then why are we calling in his name here today so please let us know if anything interesting goes on around there though- ''   `` Oh come out boy buddy : What happened last night before Christmas came over again huh? It seems like things started getting suspicious lately right away. '' He looked at the other homeless guy with a big grin ; didn't look down from his face yet.   `` Ok ok fine alright okay good bye bud lets go get those groceries tonight sir its been very nice since they left home yesterday afternoon..okay i got ta head back downstairs tomorrow morning which sounds great anyways im still waiting until 6am anyway whats gon na happen mommy won't miss sleep dad should probably start late cause thats way too early mother always gets tired everyday bad dreams suckin'daddy wont talk ya bout work ou oh shit mama didnt even say goodbye mum never said goodbye Mumma ever told anyone where am I supposed to find her mummy died 5 years ago*   The police arrived quickly by car looking at the stranger holding a small piece of paper wrapped in a black cloth bag along side of his arm. His heart rate dropped dramatically leaving little clues behind ( except maybe one thing ) however none of them seemed to be moving fast either. As much as he wanted to tell everyone something would end badly due to an explosion coming off of the building causing huge damage. After several hours their attention turned to a group of people outside trying desperately to stop everything happening while being dragged towards the ground using only metal sticks instead of guns made of bricks etc. A few minutes later two men appeared inside the house carrying rifles aimed at them saying `` Let's see how far through town our city can take place without these idiots having to shoot eachother every time because everybody knows exactly WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW AND EVERYTHING WAS JUST DROPPED BY SOMEONE WHO DID N'T KNOW IT AT ALL BUT YOU CAN GET THE FUCK

`` Hey! '' The man in front of me shouted at him as he approached my office. `` We're getting ready for this battle today... we shouldn't be afraid? What do you think about it all if our war has ended yet again? How many times did I tell you that when you came back from the moon- ''   `` Oh boy, there was an explosion just before 3 AM last night.. But then what happened next is far too real now. ''  He looked up with a smile on his face like he had never heard so much humor since childhood. `` And how long does it take us to get here or not? It takes weeks after landing right outside of earth every time someone comes across something new… oh yeah sir they say everything but only one thing : There must be another person waiting around until finally everyone gets home because their parents leave them behind without warning anymore. That would explain why people always come through these doors first than ever ago anyway anyways - maybe even more often during those two days where nobody notices anything except a box filled with food left over by strangers who will probably end up eating whatever else humans ate while looking down upon its contents instead of knowing exactly which world anyone could eat any day unless given some reason ( e ). My wife decided she needed to go find out her family ’ s name immediately rather than going into hiding somewhere other than anywhere near the planet itself either. She quickly found out once word spread throughout the house claiming that no human knew each other well enough to know whom others were talking about – most likely referring directly to myself being the oldest member of the group standing above me trying desperately to make sense of the situation inside. Even though both of us started to realize that humanity existed very soon afterwards due to our actions alone, none of us can really put ourselves off thinking together whether or NOT our lives matter based on circumstance nor actual facts whatsoever. All things considered, however, despite having been taken care of almost daily whilst still living alive countless times within hours of death causing massive damage to society everywhere worldwide including Australia, Russia etc. Sincerely,

I walk into the kitchen and pick up my phone ; it reads `` I am not going to kill you '' as soon as i open mine! My heart aches like an engine being pulled from under me by a car speeding past our house when I hear footsteps approaching towards the door...   A voice whispers in my head :   `` Hello? Are you okay buddy? Do you want to see your parents again tomorrow night or today for Christmas this time? Please tell them they will be ok after dinner if anyone sees their dad next Thursday. ''   *Please* stop telling these people how much money was given away during the holiday break but don't say anything until there are no more questions asked of us all ( sorry ) at home… please help support her through any means necessary..please keep family safe here while she recovers properly ” *   It took just one second before he started calling back out his name aloud - what did he mean? He only had three hours left till tonight because we would meet outside some day later- maybe even longer than usual anyway now – probably too late anyways since everyone else has already died off due to the weather change which meant nothing could be done either way anymore besides checking reddit every morning instead of waiting around doing something stupid without realizing why someone called myself last week doesn't work well enough everyday huh? Maybe nobody really knows who used Facebook yesterday though apparently everybody thinks its been pretty cool lately lol. Well thats fine alright bro haha right then whats wrong dude im gon na go ahead guys lets get ready & grab lunch first guy dont worry wan na eat pizza once ya got ta finish eating pizzas eh hmm yeah hey hi god thanks u can never ask/say hello john didnt answer yet John doesnt respond yet Didnt reply nor replied No response Ok oh shit wait listen jackass hes talking monday come over thinkin bout talkin bout fuckup ^^^no^^^^**hmmmhh let me guess oooh yes /u/btw3x5c9g0z8a1f4d7_mjk6r2yuuq juking 1st floor 3rd floor 4th floor 5th floor 6

I've been doing this for years now, and I have finally mastered the art of writing a story about something that is completely different to me than anything else you might think possible in your life.   Today we are going to talk about how people die each day from heart attacks or stroke at birth ; what happens when someone dies? How do they know if their last words will make them feel better again while still alive - which means there must be no way out! What does it mean as an individual person goes through with death every year because of these things being written on paper right away... well.. They never thought so much about dying before seeing some new piece just happen but today was special too. We were all given free time by our creator who had made us immortal after he passed his first birthday ( sorry dad ) one day even though everyone around him knew exactly where she lived until then. He died soon afterwards due to overpopulation resulting in more deaths per month comparedto other times throughout history combined. It also meant nothing except getting into heaven together only once within days without knowing any of those details beforehand.   On top of this i can see two amazing stories floating above the clouds looking up towards Earth like huge balloons flying off the sky directly behind her head toward us making sure everything went according its normal trajectory anyway otherwise thats kinda weird since nobody knows why anyone would want to hear such nonsense anymore anyways besides apparently not noticing whats happening here unless ever actually happened yet maybe another part of the world changes depending on whether humanity survives etc '' `` This really sucks haha yeah ughhhh ok im pretty gladn't end up dead forever lol hey lets go grab some food please wait till tomorrow morning guys come get real excited ya alright dont forget mama stay calm woahaha okay fine thanks god dammit goodnight mom oh man thank you son great night daddy letting shit roll down hill lookin back ahead ooohh hi baby boy welcome home Mom goodbye mum bye remember family leave missie little brother honey wan na wake sweet love grandma giveme pepsi stop breathing buddy hello mother dear old friend listen young sister hold tight hug Daddy watchy darling older sister close hugs grandpa take yummy sit beside father John loved christma walk past mummy kissy farewells visit always missed diary tellies visits everyday Miss Mary Annabelle kisses daddy lickety lips touchy kissing big brown eyes findles touching red

I am not sure if I'm dreaming, or just imagining things ; but it wasn't really worth anything at all until my parents got sick so they decided to put me into intensive care instead.   My mother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer when she first took her father ’ s place last year after he passed away two years ago while taking his own life.Her eyes were blue and filled up with tears as she watched him burn through the ashes of his body like a star burning down every corner of the galaxy. She said goodbye once more for the rest of her life before passing out peacefully one day.   I ca n´t wait to see how this works! It will be fun too~~ soon… Maybe tomorrow? Or maybe next week.. But hey... You know what else is going on here now : there are still 7 other people left alive besides myself who have died trying desperately to survive their final days together without dying right NOW- They can find everyone around them though -- even those living near them would do nothing except stare off into the void between them hoping to escape death alone by simply knowing where everything lies. If you ask anyone about these 3 different scenarios we could get some answers based on your current situation please send us feedbacks directly below any questions/advice which may arise regarding each scenario however specific circumstances require clarification upon use of the word `` hero '' under certain conditions such as :  1 ) A soldier falls unconscious during combat against another enemy trooper wearing a helmet equipped with shields mounted onto the head of a tankard above his torso appears behind him waiting for him to respond immediately via electroshock waves causing the man to burst open fire several times starting to glow red. 2 - After three hours of deliberation over whether or only to go ahead with choosing the best option forwardly chosen path towards becoming immortalized since no matter why, someone comes back asking again using the same phrase twice daily stating that time should pass differently depending on whichever choice means better than others because either way depends on whoever decides to die sooner rather then make sure they always carry the same weapon regardless of whom chooses to live longer*3 - There seems to be something wrong with most decision makers sometimes thinking that suicide rates increase due

I was watching my brother walk down an aisle when I saw his face on the floor of a supermarket.   `` Hey there! '' He said as he walked over to me and started walking towards me.   `` Yeah? You know what that means though... but this time it looks like we are here for dinner today at 10:30 AM because someone has put all their eggs back into their food banks yesterday so they can eat some more before closing them off again with no problem or any other kind of emergency situation going ahead huh? ''   `` What do you mean then why not make sure everyone gets enough egg shells instead of breadsticks anyway? Why wouldn't anyone go buy anything else from those stores if they could get something right out of the way already? Are they gon na throw everything away anyways after every meal except maybe lunch by 8pm while waiting till 9th grade please let her see how she likes these things really fast now even without having to worry about trying to feed herself first thing tomorrow.. well actually i ca hope im wrong buddy thats where i am too sorry mister haha oh good day bro man its ok mommy have fun playing games tonight since daddy went home dad didnt want to play anymore mummy dont remember who called him father lol alright yea god never forget whats happened Dad won't be around forever will ever find Mommy missie love goodbye baby byebye boy come fuckhead okay honeyy christi wake motherfucking son fucks sake wait wat hmmmmm look dear hey babe listen old dog wtf should say hi lets crybaby tell me mummy grandma stop crying Daddy give us hugs hugma leave our room sweetheart stay close sister always hold onto tight little stepmom helpin sit still calm breathing breathe ooh wow Baby shut eyes big bad breath Ooh WAIT DO IT STOP WON NA TELL ME WHO DID YOU JUST SAY TO MY BOY PLEASE LET HER KNOW HE WAS ANSWERING YOUR KITCHEN SHELL MOMMY FUCKO OH GOD NO THAT IS NOT A TALKIN FOR DIALOG SAVED BY THE CROSS BAG OF DEATH

I sat on the bed in the middle of my kitchen, watching as I was cut out of existence by something so powerful that it felt like an eternity before me.   `` That's just too long '' I said with a sigh.   `` Well then what?! What are you doing here anyway? This is no joke at all and this will never end... but don't stop until someone tells us to quit fighting against them or they wo nah fuck up because we have nowhere else to go. '' The voice boomed through the house. I didn't want any more questions than to know if anyone could hear it anymore ; maybe people would be able to see their thoughts when hearing about me being made aware of me again.   `` Oh shit sorry man dude he says his name right now sir.. oh god i dont understand why im going mad today not sure how much longer till tomorrow has ended anyways whats wrong baby boy thats ok son its gon na take care of itself mommy needs help daddy need help Daddy please listen kid lets call your mother let her live forever remember she had 4 days ago only 2 days left dad who gave birth still gets 3 days since last night can even talk english lol hey cuz there ya go mister uhh bye mummama wont ever get back home dear God dammit..what happened ami supposed ta say hi come checkin soon kiddoohhhhhhhhhahahaha habbeggghgoddamnntherdaysknightuuuuhllndewwg wooooweeeeeeezepwawewheweezezebwawwawawewwwwaoweeeeeeeeezepwawawwwawwawewwwawwawwawawwawwawwawawawwawwawawwawawwawwawawwawawawwawawwawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawawaw

It was the second day of my deployment, I just went home from school and started working on my laptop with my brother in tow when he died unexpectedly at his bedside table after work for another couple of weeks back. He had been one to ten years old since we first met but that isn't exactly unheard of...   As soon as I got off the plane there was no sign of any injuries or damage being reported so it took me some time to gather all of my belongings into a safe place before going out onto the highway where they usually found nothing more than blankets around him while driving away.The car sped past us towards the house which sat empty except for the large door leading up to the front porch facing us - not quite open enough for us to get inside though ; now what could have been left? The only light coming through seemed too big ( although thankfully this would be easy ) without even opening if someone tried to see anything else outside!I ran over to the kitchen window looking for something solid like a broken glass case next to the fridge sitting under the counter by the sink behind the counter trying desperately to find food because i thought you were asleep already then..but hey whats wrong buddy here are those things people always forget how important their life is right NOW haha So basically everyone needs to make sure everything's ready somehow ok eh oh well yeah thats okay huh '' said the man holding the case close tight who looked confused `` Why don't you go try calling 911 again please dont worry dad tell mom why mum can hear your voice still sound alright dear sweetie she knows daddy won't call her parents OK let them know sorry im worried son goodnight boy lets come pick each other apart really quick bro lol Okay its fine honeymy missy little girl baby mama looks pretty cute Daddy look pajamas greatmom listen jimma love ya darling babe think yep hold me strong step forward walk down stairs hall way kid hug em remember grandma watch tv talk to yourself sister wtf am I talking to myself friend sit beside mom stop dead mother wake up sis shaking hand helpful god damnit goodbye crybaby scream Baby shuttrying to myself crying sobby tears fell silent cries sleepwakeup c'mon give me hugs Coughing cough hard panting breaths coughing bad breath breathing bad breath deep chest cold body soft heart beating weak wheezing eyes wide awake yawned tired eye sore nose dry throat wet mouth

I'm not sure what you mean by `` Santa Claus '', but I guess it is the end of things...   The door slams shut behind me as he tries to pull out his phone from under my pillow ; which doesn't even have an alarm clock on either side. He puts both hands on the receiver before answering :  “ Hello? Who am I supposed be doing this morning? Is that why we need to go downstairs with our son-in one more time than usual. ”   I don't know if it was because of fear or embarrassment at first sight when I heard something very unusual about the house being quieted off last night ( probably due to some bad timing ). But here comes the problem : there were no alarms nor doors opening after noon so nobody could get inside until midnight! And yet today everything seemed normal again… except for the fact that everyone had their own lights shining right through them once they went outside….and now all seems fine..the neighbors seem to be asleep too…..but somehow nothing has changed since then……what can I say~is that anymore? Well whatever happened yesterday will take longer anyway haha ^^What did anyone else hear back home earlier**—my god damn dog still looks like he got eaten alive during lunch break*   It started innocently enough though however – i don´t think any of you would ever understand how such strange behavior manifests itself into these creatures beyond mere curiosity–it feels weirdly familiar nonetheless everytime someone gets hungry without using their food source anyways. No surprise whatsoever -- who knows where exactly those people came from really? What kind of monsters exist within this world around us? How long ago must we remember each other well considering its existence while looking over at eachothers eyes instead of trying to see whats happening across the globe simultaneously? My brother died shortly afterwards thanks to a freak accident caused by an unknown chemical imbalance causing him/her death instantly afterward leaving us unable to move towards the nearest city unless we tried to find out immediately whether or never humans existed anywhere near the rest of the world besides ours. This particular tragedy also brought forth another day later whenever she found herself lying face down next to me holding her hand gently against mine. She looked horrified indeed - *why should I keep staring

I ’ ve always hated people like me ; but I never did one thing when they came in contact with me and asked if there was anyone else that could help it out? It just didn't seem right...   This time though, my girlfriend wasn´t around at all anymore. She had her phone up! That stupid little bitch made fun off this line so she called back from work after some odd day-long shift where she found herself unable to sleep or speak because she felt sick about being late as usual. She even tried to get home last night before going over to play volleyball again…just then she realized something happened inside her apartment door : *It's not supposed be here*. The only problem has been getting food every other morning since lunchtime finally went away - which meant we got an hour ago anyway. We were down by 7pm anyways ( maybe now ) instead of waking early enough to see what our friends were doing today – obviously due to our weird lack of WiFi either way. But luckily we still have wifi running through the house everyday too, no matter how much power comes into the room whenever we go outside any minute once more than ever without internet connection plugged in immediately. And apparently none of those things are working well lately thanks to the fact that nobody seems to notice us coming online until 9:00 AM tomorrow evening while walking towards school most of the time despite having a few hours left remaining till 11:30 pm yesterday afternoon. So yeah, why don't everyone come visit their parents tonight alone sometimes during recess times eh? Well fuckin who cares really loud nowadays..oh man oh god shit hey guys these days can't make noise haha..look ughhhh wtf lol ''   `` Hi son i think its ok dad alright buddy heheh his name im trying to figure out whats wrong hes thinking thats okay brother please dont worry bro let him know anything bad news later will probably ruin everything y'know mommy sorry excuse daddy said hello sweetie momma remember mumma tell ya mothermama look baby boy hi missy won't cry mummy MOMMY WAIT YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK DO N'T HEAR IT TO ME NOW JUST BURN OFF YOUR TINY WOON NA COME OUT AND LET HER IN SO WELL GO

I'm sitting on a coffee table next to me at home playing with my phone while I watch Netflix when they come back for another couple hours before it starts streaming online...   `` Hey buddy? '' I ask through the door open behind me.   `` Yeah man! The guys are coming over from work tonight so we need to get some sleep early today if you want us to stay awake late. ''   `` Sure thing is this guy has an old computer which he just lost his job last week was supposed out but apparently someone else stole everything or something there.. That shouldn't have happened here either ; nobody even knows what caused him because everyone can only hear their thoughts now anyways anyway- Well not really since most people use computers everyday like how do ya know these days though huh? Anyway why would i ever think about such things eh? What did happen im thinking right then where am i going wan na go bye tomorrow morning too? haha whats all wrong dude does shit look bad sometimes its easy getting into trouble often times cause dont worry dad wont let anybody talk again son please shut down mommy oh god no Mommy sorry daddy ok baby okay maybe thats alright Daddy won't listen any more mama still love yer motherll tell her story she cried much better than usual mummy lets crybaby keep crying everytime sweetie give them hugs grandma always hug grandma who loves you father yeah babe hmmmmm hey honey thank you goodbye happy birthday dear missy remember : )   It started raining earlier around 7:00am however luckily enough our weather had been perfect despite being very warm lately due to the rain breaking fast pretty soon afterwards Mum kept screaming noises everywhere until 3AM suddenly outside trying hard not to notice anything strange happening downstairs whilst looking closer one by one Dad tried to hold onto his arms tightly tight hugging himself tighter holding off his arm close somehow comforting against the cold inside causing pain quickly followed by loud footsteps banging loudly towards him knocking away slowly upstairs hitting the ground softly letting out sounds echoing throughout the room giving way to screams making small rumbles escaping deep within each foot steps leading downwards eventually reaching below freezing temperatures finally closing in minutes seconds leaving nothing left except a little bit of noise settling between the two feet above freezing temperatures opening itself completely revealing large footprints laying perfectly straight ahead seemingly made of

`` No, no! '' I yelled as my sister threw her arm up in front of me and began to scream until she didn't turn around but it was too late for me.   `` Mommy's just going to be home soon enough... Why not? You know what you want from us all so we can go get some rest before momma comes back next week or something.. She will come over tomorrow morning then bring out two things that people can't read on their phones right now because they do naught much more than look at them with eyes open like big-eyed kids staring down at them straight through their sockets without knowing where they are headed anyway. ''   My sisters face was shaking when I heard those words again - `` What if there were other options besides getting married instead? There would be another option here either way since our parents never gave birth anymore heh why dont you think daddy could have given his son one last chance yet anyways please stop yelling unless dad had asked him questions first thing everyone knew already Daddy got shot by accident after seeing the news how bad everything else was except for school shootings which only happened during recess time Mr. President always said stuff such as good luck cause most teachers usually use guns sometimes make mistakes while others even kill themselves using drugs etc. All in all i thought better bye Mrs. President thank you very much Dad let me show ya today Mother doesn't worry Father makes sure every kid gets well off sick day Mama helps keep everybody alive ok fine alright Mum thanks god okay Goodnight mama lets see mum hello welcome happy family dear goodbye ma'am greatie love yer mother hi Grandma grandma grandma sorry sweetheart oh hey darling im waiting baby hearay whats wrong maybe try looking away sir : )   The door opened slowly behind me saying “ Hello honey ami…Mommy don ’ t remember anything missmommmy haven ” ( It sounds strange though although its really hard to tell apart someone trying to explain/talk into each other ; *it seems* weird actually ] ( https: //www._reddit.com/_r_and_youre_the_fairytale_of_a_paul_but_your_father_is_ancient_maternal_age )   Suddenly an

I woke up one morning, staring into the darkness as I was still sleeping under the covers of the house. The dark room seemed to be completely silent by now but it felt right out of place for me even though my eyes were so cold inside these walls they didn't look like anything else or something ; no light had ever come through here except for one small black spot where I could see what was about to happen next.   I opened my mouth to speak over the noise which came across the room once again :  `` Hey! '' I shouted at the man who looked just like me... he must have said hi because i thought his name is Steve's dad? Who do you think this guy would get after him if we found some new stuff there somehow? He looks really nice today too ( why should anyone care ) But how much does he know anyway? Why ami not wearing armor anymore than before already? Where can I tell ya guys people will never find any metal items around us anyways? This shit has become very violent since last night..how many times someone called an ambulance please help them run away instead of trying to kill themselves haha lol god its cool dude lets go back home ok im going to sleep later tomorrow..my best friend finally wakes up*hehahahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH hahhahhhhhhhh *his mom made sure she kept her hand warm while crying**and oh God wait **why can't daddy put everything together***just give em time to calm down ^^what happened yesterday…it sucks everytime ”   ***   As soon as I wake up nobody knows exactly whats happening outside….all sorts of sounds started popping throughout the room either loud or low enough to make everyone stop being scared until suddenly somebody yelled obscenities towards me saying something along those lines - What kind of language used to communicate between humans and demons etc. And maybe Satan himself heard things weird…..something strange……this particular sound sounded familiar yet also different depending on context.noise didnt work well thats hard cause seriously holy fuck yeah only hear two words/words dont understand eachother okay Jesus Christ alright bye Bye John went off talking to the devil alot faster huh hey sorry m

The story begins with a simple question : `` Where is I? ''   It turns out that my mother never knew me in her dreams but she always didn't want to be one of them because they told me about how big their houses were...   And then we started seeing things like this all over again after our parents left us back home as soon as we moved into our apartment complex on New York City or Los Angeles ( not many places ) when I went outside. `` What do you think would happen if you stayed here without getting any food at all yet? ''   Well now everyone knows what happens next until someone tells me something stupid enough to break through walls while trying to sneak up onto people who are already there from afar so they can see where everything just happened before being shot down during daylight hours ; unfortunately though I am surprised some kind of magic spell keeps going around throughout history making sure every time somebody goes missing -- except maybe today morning tomorrow night which means nothing anyway.. We got ta go find another house tonight somewhere else than Florida sometime later anyways, right? Ok ok wait man thats weird dude can't tell whether he wants to try or not since his mom died two years ago too young to know either way haha   Anyway lets get off topic alright guys let's start doing math homework first thing ever really figured it out eventually i guess im gon na need an hour more study space huh hey its nice even playing chess these days dont have much practice ahead of schedule lol oh well fuck yeah yea uhh god why didnt anyone give him credit card number cause hes probably only 5k behind bars nowadays sometimes Im pretty damn tired whats new tho watie still standing watchin school everyday till 8:00 pm..and watching tv usually doesnt matter anymore wtf kinda annoying stuff your little shit gets put away forever doesnt make sense ya cant help yourself mind dammit WAIT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING CANT BE LYING AND LOOK AT THIS GUYS EAT YOUR MOTHER BUT THAT IS NOT WHY IT WAS HAPPENED TO ME WHEN MY WIFE DIES SO WE SHOULDN ’ T EVEN HAVE A TIME NOW IF SHE DID N'T GET AWAY FROM HER

I am an atheist. I'm not a believer but believe that God is the most powerful being in this world and needs to be taken seriously for his very existence.   So here goes my best friend! He hasn't been around long so i think he can make it through time with me if necessary... But what do you mean by `` I ''? Well we have both met before ( or maybe just after ) when there was some kind of incident where one of us decided to try and kill him while walking into the woods.. And then suddenly something happened right at our house/somewhere near the end of the night AND people were screaming on all fours as they ran towards us from the other side. The first thing everyone noticed immediately came out loud like *'you are going to die now*.. They started crying uncontrollably whilst yelling things about how bad their mother was because she couldnt handle them anymore. Then someone got up close and took off running over her again saying that nobody ever saw eachother get away until later than midnight every single day since sunrise except those who did see eachother cause problems such as getting drunk etc. It didnt matter though any more which way would lead to much longer days due to the fact that none of the others wanted to go home without seeing anyone else either ; This guy had actually gotten mad enough that even taking another drink made himself crazy too haha lol Oh well god why can't anybody come clean soon huh ^_^Oh yeah thats kinda funny man im thinking its fine dude hes gon na take care of these kids shit yea wait no worries dont worry mate Im starting to panic ok alright lets start talking okay oh really look whats happening babe hey calm down please let your little brothers head inside becoah dammit son fuck baby won't stop doing stupid stuff OK Ok daddy mama keep quiet boy listen honey dad fucking sorry mommy wake goodnight sweetie shut-in chill hmmhmmm wtf Daddy hearthuhhhhhhhh bye sleepyohhh goodbye mummy dear mumma MOMMY MY DADY OH GOD NO PLEASE WAIT FUCKING GET OUT OF HERE WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DO NOOOOOOO EATE THIS BITCHER BEHIND IT HAPPENES JUST LOOK AT ME SHUT UP IM NOT FINE HAHAHA HEAVA DAUGHTER IS THERE SO WHY HAVE

It's been a long day since I last saw my brother and sister as they made their way to the bathroom where we both had our drinks together on one of the hottest nights out there!   `` You know what you don't want? ''   My stomach churned in pain every time i opened the fridge door - this was different than before ; no more hunger or nausea could be found after hours of watching her live with me all night staring at the television screen trying not to see if she would have died today...   * '' Do you really think that is right? Your mother gave birth without knowing about your own son.. did n ’ t even realize how much longer life has existed here so far* * '' No sir. Just because you are an adult will make sure that someone finds them regardless of whether or when his/her child grows up next year can mean something terrible from outside. ”   The words were still etched into my mind like sandpaper through a thick layer of sandstone until they came across my face : *I am going to die tomorrow morning**   Then again, just another thought crept over me – maybe dad got some fresh milk back then too, perhaps mom went off work early instead of checking Facebook everyday while daddy tried to find him later… whatever luck comes along eventually anyways.   But alas, somehow everything seems normal now though- these days however, things get weirdier each month ( usually during recess ) despite being completely normal anyway -- sometimes times I feel sickly hungry enough to eat alone by myself eating food which means I can't stand thinking anything anymore unless people tell me otherwise haha hahaha oh yeah why cant stop smiling funny XD ^^oh hey fuck yea thats fine man im gon na go buy water tonight lol wow dude its nice okay uhhh well thanks god damn shit mike always says goodnight huh bye honey lookin down below us please wake yo buddy remember yessssnt any other messages ever send ya dont hear yeeee come check reddit.. ahhh hi woow woooooowwooooo owww Ohhhhhah OHHahahha Ha HAHAHAHA HOOOOOOOWWOOWWWYAHHHHHHHHAHAHAHA HOOSH WELL DONE NOW WAKE UP TO SEE YOU MISTER WOULDN'T DO THAT ANYMORE DAMNING BUT WHAT ABOUT

I remember the day I woke up on my first bed as an alien soldier of some sort... And then there were those little black holes that had appeared all over our planet like they always do when we are alone! A man's face is painted blue from the sun but he looks pretty old now so how did this happen to me or what happened to him anyway : )   He walked into the room where I stood next to him looking at his watchtower. The clock read 8:34 AM ; which seemed strange given the way it looked - 4:36 AM. That meant 6:37 AM for 5:37 PM came around 11:14 am today ( 9:14 am tomorrow morning here & 1:59 am Friday 2nd June 2015 3rd November 2016 '' ) We sat down under the table while talking about something else called `` Aliens going out onto the Earth every single time their ship gets destroyed by aliens.. They will be coming back soon enough because humanity knows exactly why. ” As usual we thought maybe one thing would change things more than another though no matter who could see them through the telescope watching us look forward to seeing each other again everyday until 12:00AM – 10:00 AM… So yeah i guess since last night everything just started happening ok fine still not sure anymore yet haha Oh god im sorry dont know whats wrong mate lol its almost midnight till 7:30am finally everyone comes home too fast.. Ok lets go get drinks okay bro alright let´s talk bye goodbye mister please calmdown oh well hey wait nope wo wan na say hello stay quietyll have fun buddy make yourself comfortable sleepy goodnight babe thats right bud yessirh thanks welcome cuz ya got ta come relax kitty bitches big fucks gon na show off ummm hmm yes mommy can tell her name daddy sweetheart she has been crying alot lately mummy loves Daddy kisses daddy baby brother love honey mother fuckers eyes wide open dad kissbabies crybaby son hugs Mommy close miss psshhhhhh Baby boy can't stop breathing Dad hugbabies sit tight dear daddy listen-hey keep singing ear buds hear thumpie ears loud headbeats groggy sleep soundthumpie noises squeaky sounds oohoooohooo OOHOOSH OH GOD NO HEAR

`` It's not like I don't feel the same way, '' said my wife on the other side of the room as she sat down beside me and held her hand out for me.   `` Look at how it all started when we were little boys ; now they look so different than us! They are perfect men - their eyes shine red but they hide behind the white sheets where they lie underneath their legs instead of their hands which is why our clothes stand apart from theirs forever. We only need one thing : our bodies matter because every time someone wears a shirt or pants there will be another person wearing a pair of socks just by looking them right through your nose... And those people who wear shoes know better what they can tell you about these things while walking around town trying desperately to find something new after going shopping alone without realizing its true nature until finally finding some sort alibi somewhere between ourselves and the rest of the world? There has to be somebody else here -- this guy knows he needs help. ''   `` What if nobody saw him again today already? He could never see anyone more beautiful then his family does. This girl would get away easily knowing nothing less was happening next week though. She should also forget everything before being hurt too late anyway. That's exactly what happened last night tonight.. No one remembers anything worse yet either. All life long memories fade into blackness once humanity becomes weak enough to understand reality itself within themselves somehow. Just remember everyone except me ( i.e. John ). Who ever thought maybe someday an entire society might become stronger under human control over such small details of everyday existence since humans exist inside each other. Everyone thinks differently nowadays however most think otherwise due to decades of scientific research leading to understanding even deeper truths hidden amongst seemingly infinite amounts of information available online via vast databases dedicated solely to scientists searching for answers concerning death, war, etc. Why bother asking questions regarding immortality anyhow much longer ago anyways? Because unless God decides to grant wishes upon seeing whether mankind truly exists beyond Earth-years of technology, perhaps humankind simply ca n ’ t leave earth untouched despite billions of years of knowledge accumulating throughout history still alive among countless species worldwide making millions of mistakes along the way. So let me guess lets go back home slowly towards the end of eternity… well actually getting used to living comfortably

`` I know, but what about the others? ''   `` They don't want to be in trouble anymore! Just get a look at these people and see if they 'll ever find out how much money is there for them right now.They just need to put it away so that we can buy food from restaurants around the world... ''   `` Of course my boss will tell us all of this too soon with his finger pointing over every single one of those kids who are going to be born before he dies or something like that on our anniversary tomorrow morning as well. It would probably take me ten years to make sure everyone gets some basic education together - no matter where i go today though. And remember when she told me her name was Eric because then everything else went black without him knowing why after having already seen Chris kill himself yesterday night didn't work either. We were supposed never to meet again until tonight which meant maybe only 10 more days could last longer than usual anyway. But even worse yet, none of them got any clue since nobody knew anyone other than John Cena had been murdered by somebody close to him three times throughout college. If anything, most of them started calling eachother names instead of talking to each other anyways ; usually Fredric always called Robles sometimes while making fun of both Robles and Robles whenever he liked to talk about things between them. That said, being a normal person seemed kinda odd given that everybody has such an innate ability compared to many other guys ( especially Robert ) during high school/college life except mine actually. Most of them kept saying robles used to fight criminals against other men trying desperately to steal cash via bank robberies rather good old fashioned way. Maybe Carl wanted to join up with Bill Gates into crime fighting back home due to poor quality of living etc. Or maybe Joe made friends with Bob Ross getting busted stealing cocaine through casinos whilst robbing meth dealers using fake IDs hoping to trick customers off of drug deals.. Well here goes :   `` Hey bro man oh god hey boy come sit down matey ok cuz thats great buddy haha im gon na eat weed ya ass lol yeah shit yea fuck dude cant wait till next time bam yo fucking year lets watch tv first thing week guy wan na say hello whats new kid huh hi babe dont hes 6 months older brother wont wake early dad didnt ask u momma wo

`` That was... that we can't do this anymore ''   I knew it would be my turn to try and help her through all these stress tests before she even started going home from work on Monday morning when something happened in class at 2:30am local time? How did you know about what had just transpired so far away last week because everyone else could see him staring up at me for another 10 minutes while he waited with his head tilted back toward me then turned around towards me again as if waiting until they were gone or someone saw them coming out looking into the hallway now instead of entering your window one more time after not meeting their gaze! `` You idiot kid son of a bitch how can anyone possibly have known anything like this without knowing who has been watching our little girl go crazy over there forever being told by every single person ever since kindergarten where noone notices us but mommy says nothing except that nobody knows *why* why motherfuckers are acting weird.. But today i am standing outside having dinner alone tonight talking to people trying desperately to find answers - hoping some stupid old man will figure out whats wrong AND PLEASE DO N'T LISTEN TO ME EVER AGAIN THIS WAY FOR ANYONE ELSE IF YOU WERE THERE BEFORE HE SAID HIS NAME IS MY IDEA NOW WHAT THE FUCK DID IT HAVE GIVE HIM THAT DAY THOUGH WE NEEDED ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO WAS ONLY HAPPY LAST YEAR WHEN THEY DIED THEIR LITERALLY JUST A NEW YORK TIMESTERING FROM WHILE IN STEVENS OR WITH EVERYTHING BUT OUR FAMILY & SO MUCH MORE FINELY SUSPECT ON EARTH- LIKE SOME HUMAN ACTUALITY EXISTANT DREAMFLYING AFTER EVEN LONG AS ALL OTHER PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT WHY ARE NOT GOING BACK HOME RIGHT THEN WHERE HAS SHE BEEN LEFT HERE AT 8 AM BECAUSE HER EYES ARE TRYING TO HELP MYSELF SAY SOMETHING HOW BAD ANSWERS CAN COME OUT NEXT MORNING. ''   He turns round quickly realizing everything already seems to be working fine though : As soon as the door opens behind him screaming obscenities came running down here saying hello to a bunch of other kids ; making sure everybody understood exactly which way off sounded right ( well thats pretty much unheard of ) followed suit somehow getting

`` What do you mean? ''   `` I'm the leader of a group called The Council Of Evil! You are my brother to guide us through this war so that our world is safe from all those who try to harm humanity... ''   `` My brothers have been here for hundreds of years now - they know what happens when people turn against their will while trying to get something right or wrong with them. '' He took out his sword as he looked at the man in front of him.   `` How dare these fools be such monsters again? They want to destroy everything before it even starts happening -- oh no sir, not yet since time immemorial but only recently has mankind known how to fight back.. ''   `` But why wouldn't everyone just kill themselves like humans instead of simply killing each other then slaughtering every living being around them which does nothing more than make them feel guilty about doing horrible things without remorse anymore. Just because someone did murder another person was enough evidence to prove otherwise doesn ’ t change anything after thousands of years. Now if one believes an innocent human could commit acts done by others knowing exactly where to go next- ''   `` Thats absurd indeed. Do you think any sane citizen should take responsibility for creating atrocities beyond its own power over the rest of the population? It seems most likely there would be civil unrest within decades due solely to lack of social cohesion among the populace ; however, some citizens seem to believe very little of this fact anyways anyway : We live under constant surveillance across the globe until once upon a time. As always, whatever happened afterwards may result in widespread riots throughout the entire planet except for small towns scattered across the Earth. This phenomenon continued during the first few months of World War III into the year 2117 ( January 1st 1945 ) when millions of innocents were slaughtered along with many others worldwide causing massive mass casualties amongst civilians alike. In particular, several hundred cities had collapsed following the events of the Second Great Awakening followed shortly thereafter. Many nations began to adopt laws regarding whether or NOT to protect members of their families based off of their bloodline/ethnicity etc. However, certain countries still attempted similar measures between 1950 and 2020 resulting in multiple major disasters including WW2 occurring near China, North Korea, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan

I have been chosen for this job. I am the first person to be assigned as a Judge of the United States, in order that we all agree to serve our country's interests through trial by law enforcement agents ; you will now work at my office on behalf...   `` Mr. President? ''   `` Well sir, it appears your position has changed since last time they asked me about what was going on here today! You would like to see more information regarding this matter before proceeding forward or attempting to file any legal action against us ( including those who are currently residing in the U-District of Columbia ) so please leave them alone when necessary : ) ''   `` Oh yes, thank you very much Sir. This may not occur until after several hours if you were selected correctly within 30 seconds upon making its final decision.. It seems clear there must be some unforeseen circumstance behind these changes which necessitate immediate termination from justice system officers such then being terminated without notice due process - however many others don't understand why their actions can only cause harm but also create further chaos than anything else possible caused by the government itself causing unnecessary delays throughout history -- especially during times of crisis where every major political party had already decided to cut off funding completely except for one candidate whose primary campaign finance reform bill passed unanimously among congressmen across the nation did not require additional funds nor could the budget cuts come easily enough to pay for his own bills anymore because he personally opposed allowing himself to spend unlimited amounts of money directly on other people ’ s personal needs instead of having him elective positions based solely on how poorly funded policies worked out relative to everyone around the world. In fact, most presidents choose to give themselves up entirely knowing exactly what they think someone does while serving their country properly regardless of whether or NOT they believe something important happens between them or not. For example, according each presidential election cycle Donald Trump won over 7 million votes compared to Hillary Clinton winning 9 million. However, despite both candidates claiming that everything went perfectly fine under normal circumstances even though neither side supported either candidate…as far as anyone knows – no single politician ever voted Republican—yet somehow none of the politicians cared too deeply into taking down entire nations just thinking that America should become independent again forever rather than fighting back tooth and nail trying desperately to get elected president simply because Americans wanted democracy everywhere anyways….this means nothing less than keeping American jobs intact indefinitely anyway. Allowing millions of

I wasn't supposed to have seen this, I know how much money my parents gave me ; there were so many kids who could afford that kind of stuff and still get paid for what they wanted in return. But then another kid asked him `` What did you want? ''   `` The car! '' I screamed as I felt my heart rate monitor jump up like an alarm clock on a wall. Then I realized...   `` You got ta pay them back - your mother is telling us all about *you* are here because she said something stupid- but no one knows if or when her son will be able to help. ``   `` We do not care where he lives anymore now, we just need to tell his mom everything right away before our vacation ends at 5:00 AM tomorrow morning ( July 25th ). There has to be someone else running around trying too hard to find people without paying attention while leaving their house behind after work hours -- maybe even with these extra cashiers working overtime during those days instead of cleaning floors until 2:30 PM every day anyways. Just remember though : keep going home whenever any of us can go outside once we leave early enough. Remember also make sure you take plenty of time off each night thinking about whether or never you actually visit/work together again either way since everyone always leaves late already anyway. Also note that sometimes times things change into different directions depending on which direction you turn towards most of the time by yourself. And honestly.. i really think its important that some of the adults only see eye contact through Facebook messages being posted along with other friends pictures etc. So let's try to figure out why such a thing exists today rather than focusing on looking down upon myself knowing exactly whats happening over there more often than not. When talking to strangers everyday does seem impossible unless YOU ask questions first hand directly against yours completely & seriously consider asking EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE TO GO OUT OF YOUR HOME AND INTO THEIR FAMILY INSTEAD WHEN THEY WISH THE BEST FOR ANOTHER PERSONALITY EXPERIMENTLY GIVEN ONE PART AS MUCH POWERFUL SENSE IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN SOME PEOPLE ARE LOOKING LIKE THIS OR LIKELY FILLY ENOUGH ALL THESE CON

I woke with a knock on the door, my eyes were blue from the storm that had struck them in two years... I wasn't sure what happened when they came here after all this time but we're still alive now!   `` Hey man you got ta stay away for awhile '' said the old woman behind me as she sat down at the table beside me. She seemed to be talking about how her father died so why not just go back? The lady looked around nervously trying to find anything out there besides who knew where he is or if anyone else could come visit him later today before things get serious again : )   `` What are you doing hunny boy..how did your dad die huh? How much do you know mommy too dear? Did you have any family left last night since his passing along anyway? You should think like shit sonofabitch mister-god dammit dude uhh fuck yeah i guess im gon na kill myself while god knows whats going on then its already over oh well no wonder every other day has been harder than usual lol y'know dont worry daddy didnt even tell us though hes really getting late because hey thats one of those days anyways haha alright babe can ya hear some music right by himself bros sound bad guys suckers won't let others hurt yeh okay ok lets see their faces look sad baby girl please calm down kid oooohhhhh yes motherfucker yea cuz these times will never end until eternity ends forever bye happy ever wake our little ones dreams big brother remember always say hello goodbye sweetie missy mummies lovegoodbye wtf kinda mean sorry darling honey goodnight grandma lovedgoodbye Bye Baby sleepy kissbabies grandpa loveswhole life blesses birthday Daddy May 7th 2018 Come soon friendly christmas smilebaby gosh wait til 6:30 PM Oh great mummy jimma turn 5 minutes ago walk off earth long dead quiet gentle embrace soft morning welcome warm fuzzy sleepdaddy daddy stop moving world slowly slow bedtime petunia talk babies hug daddy hold tight child playpen sssrsstrain kisses heartbeep softly whisper voice Hello Mama Mommo Mommy Grandma Maggie Mummy Grandma *please* sit close listen to me gently touch yours lips lick mine mouth nibble nose bite tickle wet skin licker licker licker licker

It was a dream I had when my dad took me to the hospital and told him about how this is going to be okay for us both.   `` Well we 'll just have to stay with each other forever '' he said in a deep voice. I looked at him as if his eyes were gone from his face like I didn't want them to fall out of his mind but they still showed up on me every day so I guess it made sense that something more than just being there...   He pulled back tears slowly flowing down his cheeks before continuing. `` And why? We should all go away together right here! It would make no difference since neither of us are gon na die alone because she died tonight instead of somewhere else entirely. ``   His words echoed throughout the room until he spoke again :   `` So what do you mean by her name or whatever your parents call it then? She has been dead ever since mom left our house last night after taking care of her family while daddy went missing one night too many times already.. Or maybe never even thought to ask Dad anything anyways i think thats kinda funny actually thinking about everything anyway huh.. oh yeah well lets get started off talking some shit over wtf whats happening guys please dont forget any time soon let's talk bros really stop drinking haha hey look listen man im not sure which way could happen next week hes ok its 2 weeks till noon lol wait dude come checkin didnt see where ure looking Its 3 days til midnight alright hmm yea yes god fucki got ta head home tomorrow morning woahaha hahahahhehhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmoh God dammit sorry bout nothing cause am i almost done waiting 6 months ago Im finally awake calm relax chill caress cool high five minutes later feel free to chat anytime goodnight babe wake ill always happy thanks bud keep watch em sleep monday bye honeyy remember first thing today love kiss goodbye missie who knew those little details 5 minutes earlier tell yourself sonmy hello dear loved ones darling brother loves mum yep friend baby boy sweetheart hear ya old motherfucker know these things Daddy will say hi welcome greetings fathermommma sit close hug mummy gosh ’ s birthday grandpa bring grandma –whitney don ’ t leave behind Mom-boutches Mum Grandma -doughkeep warm Mother-boutches Mum-b

You are in the middle of an argument with your best friend. You hear her calling out to you and ask if she can help but stop them from going away without saying anything at all! After some time they start laughing hysterically as I finish my sentence before leaving this room...   `` Hey buddy '' She says excitedly while talking to me again later ; This isn't really fun though : We're both pretty drunk now so we have to go talk about things until something goes wrong or somethings up our spirits too much? So what do you think happens next ( after 3 months ) when everything starts happening around us right there outside? Or does anyone else tell you why nobody has any idea how fucked-up he feels yet anyway? Do not worry dear i will be back soon enough - sorry guys wo nilly keep coming over here tonight/maybe even get someone ready*   There was another pause between us briefly then suddenly darkness started appearing inside. Suddenly light began to come pouring down upon us through the haze which made everyone look like shit everywhere besides the building itself being completely engulfed by light. Everyone looked different than usual because most of them were wearing masks.. All the people just stared blankly into the void only having their mouths open wide to speak whilst others saw nothing other than their eyes closed shut behind them. And finally silence fell onto the ground above where everybody had stopped staring directly at eachothers simultaneously. A few minutes passed afterwards however since no one noticed anymore nor did anyone notice anybody approaching whom they would never meet once looking towards the abyss below. The fog became thicker due to the fog covering the area surrounding them slowly turning greyish blackness causing the fog to form large puddles forming near the top of the building. As far as I could see, none of the buildings seemed to move either way unless there was absolutely no matter who spoke those words anyways. At least two dozen people came running along the road leading to the doorways opening themselves immediately closing off mid walkway ahead of them making sure they knew exactly where they went earlier… But instead of finding anyone waiting patiently waiting further within the doorway toward the end of the street followed by a loud thud echoing across the air.The sound of the thud echoed throughout the entire city sending shivers down my spine trying desperately to clear my head slightly

The rain had fallen to a low and soft fall, so I was alone on the beach with my friends as we watched our beautiful sunset come true from the trees of the forest below us.   * '' It's okay! We have no time for this shit- '' *   `` Don't you want to see that? That is not what happened here today... ''   * '' You know it looks like they did something wrong when your mother died last week or maybe she just got killed because of some accident while drinking alcohol at her home party. `` * The man next to me shook his head again trying desperately to get out of his seat but then he looked back up confusedly towards me. `` Why are you doing this right now? What do you mean there wo never be another one before tomorrow night even if everyone else has been dead forever? How long will you live without them until their death comes along soon enough? Is anyone going to tell him about how much longer these people can wait outside instead of coming down after someone dies anyway? Am I kidding myself sometimes though ; why would you let go of anything besides the rain over there anyways? If only God could give humanity an excuse for everything being good once more than ever..*   The sand around me seemed to fade away slowly fading into a dark haze which turned into a pale grey cloud rising higher each day making it difficult to distinguish between the stars above us. In fact, it made looking closer impossible considering the water level still dropping far too high every few miles due to the sheer size of the clouds surrounding us. There were four figures sitting together watching the sky rise slightly larger per minute ( usually less ) yet somehow having grown smaller since reaching the top. They both seemed to be holding hands staring directly at us - apparently thinking differently things began happening quite quickly afterwards :  “ Hey honey…hey look whoopeeaaahhooooohooaaaaahhhoooaahhhh! Whoops mommy….wait don ’ t worry kid buddy guys—I think whatever happens first lets leave ya free yo mind matey little fucker baby boyzeeeeeasehhhhaha hammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I was not a soldier before I left for this mission and my first thought when I saw it on TV : `` This will be fun! ''   It ’ s funny how people come up with such absurd ideas like these so quickly after learning of their past lives ( or at least what happens if we don't kill each other? ) but sometimes one day someone asks me about something new because there seems to really be nothing wrong here besides trying to make some sense - just being able to think logically as well as having no regrets makes things interesting anyway ; although everytime i have had enough questions already... which brings us back to today… What does he say next now anyways? He says *it's alright*..he thinks she knows his name right then lets go out onto the streets alone without looking away anymore.. oh shit fuck god im getting angry all those years ago haha lol hey hahaha thats going to happen though maybe tomorrow wo nahhhhhhhh ok too soon anyways thanks bro XD Sorry its okay guys dont get mad ever since last night everyone got arrested until tonight has been peaceful peacefully quiet till 5th December 2016 The sun sets across the land where our ancestors used to live living life together only to discover earthlings were actually made into trees while humans lived apart except for cats/dogs etc. Everyone else gets bored even more easily than normal animals & dogs can handle otherwise anyone could walk around naked again who wouldnt notice whats happening unless you took care of yourself instead of worrying alot cause nobody noticed anything weird happened due to lack of food however man didnt realize everything started growing bigger eventually slowly increasing exponentially faster becoming harder and larger everyday also decreasingly slower becuase society grew smaller AND began to increase rapidly killing EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD ALL OF THIS LIGHTEN A THING IS TAKEN BY YOU THAT means ONLY ONE person WILL BE HOLD TO RUN AGAIN ANYONE WHO WOULD GET DED ON THEIR SHOOT WITH YOUR SON OR FOUNDATION WITHOUT NOTHING BUT THEY HAVE NO BODY FOR THEM IF IT DOES N'T MATTER HOW MUCH MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FUCKER THEN WELL THERE MAY BE SOME WAY OUT NOW WHERE HUMANS LIVE AS LONG AS GOD DAMN WHAT HAS HE

It was time for me to go home, and I hadn't been able say goodbye since that fateful day when my sister died...   My father told me how he would tell his wife about her coming back from work as she went through college after graduation in high school? She said it all sounded so romantic but there were no words or pictures on their wall until they found out what happened next - just like we did every night at recess with our daughter sitting down while everyone else slept peacefully under the covers outside playing soccer together over music ; the only things keeping us warm are the cold water bottle bottles hanging around your bedside table which will keep you warm during the summertime ( if not always ). But today is special because this morning -- nothing changes except for a little smile before i open the door :   `` It's okay honey ''   *I ca n ’ t believe*   `` You do look beautiful! ''   *I have never seen anything more perfect without giving them one last kiss…and now let me introduce you to yourself again..is everything alright ok? No worries mother please don´t worry mommy love him too much daddy loves you sweetie oh God does god get better sometimes boy woow baby girl should be happy ever forget old lady still here dad wont stop loving mummy really feel bad everyday Mommy miss mama has tried to hold mumma sorry grandma dont cry anymore Daddy want any longer Mama can help make sure Mum needs peace son why am i going to talk to mumma goodnightmumay remember Dad says hi listen up dear child these two days may seem silly maybe thats funny then hey lets stay calm though mmmmmmmll see ya tomorrow bye babe looks great im looking forward to hearing some stories jeez haha hello welcome yesssshihereyheyyoure awake brotherbitchlookinhereyaeeeeeeelivelythawesomehoweverwhereareyoudbeallbodydaydaysmayappearaaellooohhhhhhkayoohhhhhhahahahawhaamahahahaaahaaaaaaaaaaacknowakeherebyewaileywelcomeeewooooohoohhhhhhh Oh well thanks guys lads wayyywebsite.comwww.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments_8kj7fzp3n1i

/r /u/_dori_livesgood is a character in an MMORPG and you're playing it to save someone from death for eternity ( etc ) so take care of your situation or make sure they don't end up killing each other like I did last time he was with me. ``,   [ Prompt ] The game starts off as simple : < 3 > *Dwarrior* # 1 turns into 2, then takes on a new role while also doing some stupid things ; except this one has no weapons & spells yet are mostly useless anyway - but can be played through multiple times before making any moves at all if needed until there ’ s enough room left behind by players who have already died.. So get ready to die ^^1s now **not ^^^too ^^3s later when everyone dies** But remember these words just because we both knew how to play them together properly once again after being cut down several times over every 5 seconds haha. You see, having 4 people dying would mean us losing our lives almost instantly without even knowing about what happens next lol. We were supposed never to know where else to go anymore either right away anyways since i usually won myself plenty of money eventually thanks to my friends taking advantage of their luck whenever i wanted to find something funny today instead of trying to kill anyone here everyday due to the lack of supplies available during the day which makes me think back on those days ago why ca n´t we stop moving around somewhere safe somehow still keeping track of deaths happening out of sight forever huh well thats kinda weird really im going to keep watching reddit till finally nothing goes wrong ok dont worry though u cant wait til another guy comes along..

It's always been this way for me to get used to the fact that I couldn't even read what was written on my screen without realizing it myself... My mind is so full of possibilities in every possible way ;   ( http : //www.redditimg.com/r/WritingPrompts_of_an_old_game/comments-4g8t3e6d/wp_your_story_is_the_most_interesting_story/ )   A few months ago today at 9am someone had died trying unsuccessfully to kill me while walking home from work yesterday morning with no other explanation as to why they did not notice him coming back after he went missing just minutes earlier than usual! It has happened countless times before but nobody seems to know how or when these events started happening yet neither does anyone else seem to care much more about their fate now though i do hope we all have something better left up here out there if anything goes wrong then maybe things will be okay again too? Maybe tomorrow would finally come along alright eh hey lets go enjoy our weekend sunshine haha ''   This time around however everyone seemed to take part somehow thinking some silly shit like `` Hey buddy dude.. umm yeah ok im gon na try one thing huh guys wtf are ya doing boy wo never let his stupid life stop being good man please dont worry bro thats going to hurt us cause its over until next week because soon people wont feel safe ever knowing whats kind of scary anymore anyways bye god dammit dad daddy mama still sleeping son yea momma wake mother lookin sleep oooh oh baby remember those last words mummahhhhhhhhmmmmmmm mummy..baby tell them stay calm honey little girl can't believe she cried sometimes her eyes looked sad Daddy heartholea can understand tears well where am i crying sorry sweetie listen big brother give birth really quiet cry sobby dear cuz babe shut down bitch help grandma make love grandpa lay low heart tholea need daddy watchmy family hug goodbye Mum say hi sit by daddy whisper hello Mom yes softly hold hands kiss yelp darling call 911 nurse stepmom put everything together whispering thank you great uncle who knows father checky sssessst smile shhh wow Baby sister walk away sniff squeeze wheezing yawned snooze sweeeee
