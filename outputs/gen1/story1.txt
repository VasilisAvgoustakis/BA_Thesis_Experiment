The girl turned and looked at me. She had been sitting there on her bed, staring at my face, wondering what I was seeing in her eyes. I stared back at her, and then at her head, and then down into the floor. She looked up at me, and then down into that dark brown space between the two of us. I wasn't looking away from her, I was looking at her.  It was all over now, though. There were people walking towards her ; they hadn't noticed anything until they reached her. And she looked straight ahead, and then out of her peripheral vision, and through her nose, and into mine, and into hers, and into mine.   It was like a dream come true.
You are part of an elite team tasked with guarding your city's most notorious criminals - you have just witnessed them being executed by one of their own men who is also known as `` Villain ''... You walk around while talking to him/her about how he got his hands dirty during interrogation ( but does nÂ´t know which ). Describe this encounter :
I woke up early again because I felt the cold hard surface of my fingers digging into my skin against the cold metal. I could feel my flesh tightening under the cold metal grip. I tried to force myself to stand upright when I heard the sound of a hammer cracking open on the floor.  *BANG*   *Bang! * I thought as I heard the screams of the first man before me. I grabbed my gun tighter and held it firmly in my hand. *BANG! BANG! BANG! *   *bang! Bang! *   *bANG! BANG! Bang! Bang! Bang! *   I opened my eyes and saw a man standing behind me. He was dressed in a black robe with a hoodie draped over his shoulders. His clothes were dark blue, and his hair was long, and his arms were long. He was wearing a black cloak with a white button down shirt underneath. His mouth was wide open. He looked at me and asked if I wanted to talk.  `` I want some change today? '' I said.  `` No thanks sweetie, I need you to stay calm here okay?
