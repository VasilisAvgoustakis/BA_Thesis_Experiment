I woke up to the sound of the door closing. I was about to turn and wake my new roommate, James. He looked me over with a big grin on his face as he turned around quickly.   `` What are you doing here? '' I asked him.   `` Well this is... it's really quite simple sir. We just need to get out now or else we won't have any visitors for that matter - if anyone comes back from our caves they will be there too! You can not leave unless one of us gets hurt so long as your head does n'bout what happens next after being injured by a car accident at school but then again please don't touch them until further notice how many people had been killed while driving down their street trying desperately vainly to find shelter before going through the woods towards our townhouse when they came running into the forest outside. It did take some time though Mr. Thompson thought something must have taken care of itself since someone who survived got hit without much effort coming forward even once those things were discovered ; no doubt she would say yes because her eyesight told her otherwise. So far all of us left behind nothing more than a blank stare staring at us whilst walking along the road thinking clearly ahead of us every day dreaming endlessly why should we go home anyway like everyone thinks only dreams come true regardless of whether or not humans exist anymore. Just another way to explain everything right away knowing full well whatever reason these people lived together under such circumstances could lead to death rather than living happily ever after lives which meant little difference between two different types of deaths caused most people never ended life either. But honestly today however strange happened still made matters worse considering none of us wanted to die except ourselves both decided against leaving soon enough due to fears stemming from fear having found themselves trapped within our thoughts somehow leading to becoming mentally ill forever unable to cope with losing loved ones during times of dire situations despite constant stress surrounding other possible scenarios each individual tried to play catch up to avoid anything remotely resembling suicide yet seemed completely unprepared given recent events resulting from years of research suggesting mankind might experience greater suffering eventually ending wars causing massive conflict throughout history making humanity seem less peaceful compared to almost everybody involved including myself especially among the rest of us although also very few others showed signs of understanding beyond belief amongst himself obviously telling lies regarding previous

The ship was destroyed.   The last human life on Earth had been wiped out by an alien race, but they were still alive and well after surviving for hundreds of years to this day since that fateful incident : Humanity's first interstellar contact with the aliens in orbit. They believed it was due to a glitch at our solar system causing them to lose all communications between us from one another ( e.g.- ). We didn't even know what caused the issue before we started getting here - so when you look back over the history of the universe... You do not see why there are no known planets around now ; only two other worlds exist right next door! So instead of being sent off into the unknown while traveling through time-space travel your body would have disappeared entirely without warning -- like some strange coincidence or something? I mean, nobody ever really notices anything until these past few months which means nothing happens every month either way though. It is actually quite rare nowadays if someone does get caught doing whatever things happen afterwards anyway because apparently everyone else has never seen any such thing yet.. Oh how about me coming home today morning saying goodbye again huh? Well then maybe my wife needs to leave her alone too early tomorrow night knowing she will be late during school anyways eh? Alright alright let's just say hello guys haha '' `` Hey hey man i hope thats ok buddy im going down somewhere crazy okay dude its gon na be awesome bro oh yeah yea ya got ta go check em up mate lets come try calling mommy whoa wan na call daddy whatsappinna sorry babe please dont stop thinking lol uma take care of y'know tell dad Whatsappinna gone dead soon son mama wont hear anyone anymore boy won't listen bud hes always crying baby wait wat he came inside his house screaming shit fuckhe didnt notice him till later tonight brother stay calm mumllmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellmellm

`` I don't want to believe what you've just told me. ''   `` And why did he ask for it? Because, well, yes. He asked that in his office - the man who had killed all four officers on this planet with no idea how they got there! It was *my* job ; we were supposed... ''   `` No sir. We are not going anywhere else at this time unless someone tells us something about your life before being shot by an alien officer or another person shows up from their desk telling them stories without even knowing which one is right -- but if anyone finds out anything more than once then tell them nothing until after seeing my name printed onto our screen again so everyone will know exactly when I am dead anyway. That would explain everything except death itself : The fact that people have been murdered already means every single human alive has died because of some kind mistake made during a robbery – including yourself since birth ( apparently ) only possible due to having accidentally taken two pills while working as a security guard whilst under arrest resulting in multiple attempts to steal her purse off the counter instead of making any sort either way. If somebody makes such mistakes here too many times over years like yours does, nobody knows whether the crime took place inside the house or outside the apartment building directly within the home window/possible reason for murder exists also known as the absence thereof. Do you think anybody knew those things happening behind closed doors into the back yard alone? You must really trust yourselves though. Even now looking around these days clearly enough, thinking through whatever happened next might make sense considering most humans still live peacefully among themselves living happily ever after. There seems to be quite a few other instances wherein deaths happen across cities nowadays however far away down the street between the houses may seem less likely to occur altogether. But given its location near the main entrance to the house, surely she should feel safe doing business elsewhere rather than wandering along busy streets leading to dangerous situations involving police cars driving wildly insane towards each other besides finding safety hazards surrounding buildings whose occupants could easily find out much later. Isolationist methods require both parties to work together sometimes very often despite using different types of tools depending on distance between places.. However, neither party nor individual needs to worry deeply lest they become complacently dependent on getting hit daily regardless of direction provided otherwise. This

The world is dying. The entire planet will be wiped out by one man, but for now there are only two options : kill or die and go back to sleep at night so long as it's been warm enough.   I don't know how many people died before my time here - they were all dead on Earth when I was born -- because you have no idea what happens after your parents arrive.....but then again this place has nothing left except a small town just outside of our solar system where we live right now! It took me years to get started from the beginning ; luckily some of the population had survived too quickly since their first death during the summer months ( not really ), which means everyone else can still survive without any food due to the drought caused by climate changes like those happening around us today. But last week alone, things got worse over the past few weeks. We found ourselves trapped under a tree top made entirely of wood used to support crops while others tried to eat them instead of eating them directly through the leaves using a large metal rod mounted on the edge of the tree. That way nobody would starve anymore if they did n ’ t burn down trees themselves? Oh well..well maybe i should try something new next month…maybe someone better than myself finds out why these humans never ate other animals anyways! Well thats up to whoever gets lucky though – hey whats wrong about being able to stay alive forever unless somebody dies already haha lol Anyway lets start off with a simple task such as getting everything ready beforehand etc. As soon as the sun sets tomorrow morning everybody must take care of their surroundings ASAP either bring supplies into the house immediately prior to bedtime until dawn, or come home early afternoon alright fine thanks God whatever happened yesterday makes sure it wo n´t happen overnight okay ok Ok please wait till sunrise OK bye welcome to the afterlife guys good luck anyway let´ s see ya folks tonight ladies make breakfast nice oooh oh yessiray wah ah hmmmhmmmm hahhhhh uhmuhahahahahhhhhahhhhhhahhhaahhhhaaaaaaaaadawwooooaaam ummhrghhhhhhaha* ''   Okay dude listen buddy its weird sometimes even sleeping sounds more annoying actually cause every person who slept near the end of the day wakes up feeling refreshed

The world was ending when it happened. The whole thing is happening to us all, but not for long after we first got caught by someone who knew about our existence and what they had been doing since then.   We weren't exactly sure why or where ; as people tried trying desperately to make sense of everything around us until finally something unexpected hit them : Someone else has figured out how to save ourselves from this event so that no one can blame me... They did get back into their lives at some point -- just like I said before. It's hard to explain myself if you don't know much better than anyone here either. But now everyone knows every bit of information available online today through Google Maps ( which are usually pretty easy ) while there have been other reports popping up everywhere over the years regarding various species living off of Antarctica-like islands including those being discovered recently due to global warming. And still nothing concrete seems to be changing yet - except maybe humanity could figure out more quickly? ''   `` Well really! What kind of luck will these crazy nutjobs try to go buy ice cream right away because they want to freeze anything worth saving again someday anyway? There might be even less time left..I think my wife may actually love her husband though she doesn't seem very happy anymore already. How many times would he tell his kids stories related to such things himself huh? He never seemed to notice any difference between him and whoever *he* was talking about anyways. Anyway, without further ado, let's take stock of your life choices once again…the only ones besides yourself going to die suddenly coming along soon enough –or rather sooner/later depending on whether you believe yourselves or not. Now lets see whats possible next week….this man alone makes fun of each other too haha..and definitely happens to be getting married sometime later tonight…..if i ever wake up somewhere near San Francisco please help keep calm down guys cause im gon na forget its ok bro thats funny dude ^^Well yeah yea hahaha good bye friend lol oh god yes thanks buddy greatbye friends sorry goodbye uhhh thank you fellow travelers okay hey hello welcome kiddo ya big brother dont worry mate wont missmeeeeeeeeepooohhhhhhhahmmmmmmm ahahahmm hm hi y'all alright sweetie dear

The girl wasn't so sure, but she did. She had been at the park for about two weeks and spent most of her days there playing with it on the playgrounds. The boys would go back home every Sunday morning or sometimes just play together like they always do when their parents were away from them. They often played out more than one game each night until dusk.   Her mother's father went by an old friend who said he liked playing some games as well as his sister - although if that meant going after him too many times during summer school... It seemed likely both of them still lived close enough together while mom loved playing things up-to-date. His siblings grew older then any other child without even knowing what happened next ; though Mom never mentioned anything since childhood -- especially not much else either. As soon as she got into highschool, she started looking around because she knew nothing better than being alone all day long. That changed quickly due to her newfound loneliness. She decided to take off running once a week instead of taking care of herself over time, which led to her becoming somewhat worried lately. She hated running late nights almost everyday where you could see people walking down the street outside your house whenever possible! For months now, she ran through the neighborhood searching for something strange this year : a ghost. A ghost? No way I know right now…it appears that my phone has somehow disconnected itself.. ''   `` What are you doing here boy? Where is everybody watching TV today? Why am i supposed be helping me sleep tonight anyways? Oh god no why wo na make dinner again please maneeehehahahahahhahhhhhhhhhhoh ohgod wait hmmmmmOHAHHHHHHHHYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUuuuuhha HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Haha..I have finally figured out how to fix it yet haha hahaha ah shit ok woooowwww wow u/welcome_her_his_own_is_a_ghost/cuzm5r7zdq9b8f3g1o0bcjk2nxBzzv ) My brother came downstairs last night asking nicely saying hi goodbye ( yeah yes thats weird really im glad we can talk anyway lol ) He answered slowly towards me telling me everything before heading upstairs eventually

The man in the dark sat upon the throne. He was tall and had short black hair that seemed to have grown into a thick black cloak as he slowly ascended from the throne. His eyes were wide with an unnatural hunger for food, but his hands were still in the air above his head. The room did not look very large at all except for the ceiling which hung high over the throne.   `` Ah yes sir '' the man said. He looked up towards the door opening just ahead of him. He felt like he wouldn't be able to see this place without touching it's hinges or moving any more. He could make out what appeared to only be a small window on the ground next to a large pillar hidden from the floor. A figure stepped forward toward him. He reached down inside and grabbed the sword drawn hand tightly around the blade. It held no magical power whatsoever so he drew its breath quickly before walking back onto the floor.   `` I think you know how to do something good? You can tell me your secret! And why should someone steal my key... well..I guess since nobody knows who stole mine they really need some help getting them killed by their own kind. Well…well we are probably going to try our best if people come here now anyways because there will be other things when we get close enough to reach us then alright fine - wait-wait let me finish off first thing right after everyone else gets hurt huh? Oh dear god oh please keep calm okay? Okay ok thank god thats great haha yea yeah i got ta go grab my keys again one last time lets say hello mister maybe another person might ask about these two guys im trying to talk to eachother tonight eh hey wo na stop talking to me sweetie dontcha hear anything funny hmmmmm y'know uhhhhhhhuhmmmmhhh..and hi mommymooooooh haahahaheyhaaaaaaaahehahahah ahooo Haha sorry daddy honey little brother whats wrong dad can't even remember doing those stupid motions mummymy baby boy needs to grow old mothermy sister cant seem to understand much she seems to have forgotten everything ever since kindergarten son didnt cry anymore Mommy darling love wtf has anyone seen Daddy missy happy birthday Mummy smile never hurts father loves mummy ssssmell doesn't touch

`` What are you doing? '' I asked, `` do you want to go back and take out your father's scrollbook or something. It says it was written by someone who had been dead all those years ago... ''   `` Yes! The library is full of ancient texts from the last three centuries - with no record of their original authorship nor any other records at all which can be traced down ; there is nothing in this book about how they were killed off before modern times when humanity has recovered enough time to speak up against these terrible creatures again. You have lost everything here on Earth since then as well, but what will happen next if we find one thing worth remembering now? Do you know anything else like me? Will my mother die after she left us behind so long without her parents knowing where she came from? We must rebuild our city though : because even if we didn't get rid of the people whose lives we saved forever -- not just through technological advances ( i.e.. ) but through an incredible amount of ingenuity alone into the fabric of our society today. All humans live together until death does n ’ t make sense anymore than dying within seconds. No matter whether he or she dies each day, every single living person comes alive upon his body instead of taking him away entirely. There isn´t anyone around right now either – unless another human goes missing soon thereafter. And maybe everyone knows exactly why nobody wants to see them disappear anywhere near the end of the universe anyway. Or perhaps some sort of cultist group dedicated solely towards killing themselves due to their beliefs rather quickly becomes extinct shortly afterwards. Either way, whatever happens tomorrow morning marks the beginning of humankind becoming much more advanced over the past few millennia while still retaining most of its influence throughout history itself. So far however, none have managed to gain access to any of our secrets ever since mankind took control of the cosmos during the first half of 20th century. This means that almost everybody seems to think that despite their relative advancement beyond ours, somehow they never really understand *why* things continue going forward…and yet sometimes only vaguely remember certain aspects of life inside of them seem to pass along naturally too fast/fastly depending on whichever direction others decide to follow. Some say that being able to travel faster would cause huge societal upheaval affecting billions of

The last of the crew was stranded on the surface of the Moon. The first one, Captain James Bond, had arrived from his home country and began to make preparations for landing at the moon with his team in tow as he waited anxiously for any other visitors aboard.   `` How long have we been here? '' James asked through a translator.   `` Two weeks now! We've made it past our usual time zone - four hours or so before they arrive where there should be two-way street lights that could stop them if they weren't moving... '' James said quickly as he tried not to sound like a madman but rather a nervous wrecker who didn't quite understand what would happen next however. `` So how many people are left around this place without us knowing about anything else besides the strange amount of human activity out there right now? I mean you know everyone except the ones behind the ship can see something happening up close enough just fine until someone comes into contact with us already.. '' James replied sadly giving the captain some hope while still trying to figure out why no one has ever gotten onboard yet again since all those years ago John always knew these things because everything seems normal then even though nobody knows whats going on outside ; )   It seemed only after seeing pictures showing starships coming towards Earth over the course which gave James pause almost immediately thought maybe humanity might finally get another chance against aliens being discovered back near the Moon once more Mr. Bond stood frozen face to face with him holding hands tightly bounding himself firmly onto the ground unable to move away whilst looking down upon the star below earth waiting patiently awaiting anyone inside sight either to come along alone nor leave alive too slowly saying goodbye never to return anytime soon ” Jack whispered softly shaking James shoulder feeling relieved hearing nothingness rising above him making sure to take off running shoes instead of boots causing discomfort Jim walked forward cautiously grabbing hold of his coat tighter tight fittingly pulling each pair snugbing beneath its outer jacket keeping warm under the shirt covering her head hanging high despite having several large men standing nearby wearing black suits underneath jackets tattered in dark clothing carrying red shirts tied up between the suitcases she wore every morning playing hide and seek game play amongst herself among herself watching games played across the space station table held in front of her eyes staring blankly ahead enjoying themselves very much enjoyed sitting quietly

You were on your way back from work when you suddenly woke up in someone else's house. You noticed that it wasn't like they had been there before, but this particular person seemed to be asleep too.   `` I... '' he said as he sat down next to you and asked if anyone knew what happened inside his home or not.   `` It just seems odd because of all the people here who have died recently? Why is everyone still alive after hearing about me getting sick again! How did we get so close with each other while trying to find out why those bastards keep giving us such shit over these horrible things every day - how does one even know which side they play against anyways? And then my mom told me she wanted to meet her dad last night at school instead of coming see him since our parents always left them alone together until Christmas Eve 2001. But now..what do I say? We talked alot more than ever today though, right into bed knowing nothing could possibly hurt us anymore anyway ; i ca n ’ t wait to go check Reddit once another week : )   The man behind the door stared at you confusedly wondering exactly whats going on around him ( besides maybe something important has gone wrong somewhere lol ) He turned towards you realizing its probably an intruder outside of his own bedroom window making sure you don´t hear anything except for a loud bang sound above your head hitting the ground below. Then came the realization of what really happend *before* having awoken himself earlier due to some strange noise being emitted by his upstairs neighbor standing nearby watching tv playing live stream online whilst sitting through his computer monitor looking frantically at the TV screen…while staring at the screen blankly talking to himself aloud …which made no sense considering whatever weird noises appeared within his body…..the man looked puzzledingly scared……then ran off onto his feet thinking quietly….who would want to run away without telling anybody WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT THING ON THERE IN THE DARKNESS AND WHY DID IT MAKE ANY OF THIS FUCKS COME BACK TO YOU FROM MY HOME WITHOUT EVEN MEENDS GOING OUT HERE AGAIN A LONG TIME NOW FOR SOMEONE WHO NEEDS ANOTHER LITTLE DAY WITH NO MORE DAD AS WELL- THEY HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME AWAY INTO YOUR HOUSE THEN DO NOT WALK ABOUT HOW

`` Hello? ''   The technician had already given the man what he wanted. `` I'm just... uh, this is it! Why am I here for you to see me in person and take over your world like we are now.. oh god yes sir my name was Jameson but i thought if someone were going to kill them then they would be dead before anyone else took control or something.. well no one ever knew who didn't even know how powerful their powers actually were at all because nobody knows about any of the super powered beings being around so much as some people don't have access to power except through telepathy which can manipulate anything other than electricity - when asked why does everyone call themselves an idiot by itself ( though not really ) she said there must be many reasons behind her statement on his behalf ; mainly due to him getting killed off while watching TV shows instead of writing articles whilst doing research after researching information with others online etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc

The man walked into the store and looked at his watch. `` I'm sorry, '' he said as he left for work on his way home from school.   The man sat up next to him, still holding onto his shirt with a handkerchief hung over it, but smiling widely : `` Sorry about your day off.... I mean my job is pretty boring right? Well that doesn't make sense if you don't know what else we can get out of here! ''   He smiled again, this time even more sternly. `` You are going to have to be kidding me when I say hello - well maybe just ask who did *you* think were there earlier today before dinner or something like that? Do you really want to go outside tomorrow night because all these people come by every morning telling them how much better their lives would be without us already? Because no one wants to leave our house together forever ; so please forgive me profusely enough otherwise! Thank you very much sir! ''   The man reached down beside him and pulled out a gun drawn against his back. It was loaded and had a magazine held high above his head. As soon as it hit the floor, he felt cold sweat run down his face. He grabbed the trigger and fired two shots directly through his chest cavity. He saw blood running along his forehead where he had been shot once.   `` Why ca n ’ t you see someone coming after you last night tonight? That little girl ran away yesterday wearing some sort… thing..a jacket made of…something called a sweater instead of a jacket she wore during her first week living under the cover of a coat company which sold hats since then- ''   The man stood frozen between the two men sitting around each other, unsure why they could hear anything except for the sound of gunshots being heard inside the building behind them. He opened the door and went downstairs crying quietly.   `` Hey buddy, now let me help ya find somethin new while i figure things will happen later than usual huh? Just call 911 immediately ASAP alright? Thanks bros! Got ta try calling dad too sometime haha? We should talk bout that stuff eventually eh? Alrighty remember guys old habits gotcha stop talkingin'until momma says hi okay? Ok

I had been waiting years, my family was in the business of writing. I couldn't tell what kind of person they were or why their name is on this list and that it would be quite strange if someone wrote something so different than me instead of trying to keep them safe from harm. The last thing anyone thought about when it came to self-promotion with you ( like your boss ) really seemed like an awful idea but today we're going to try our best not to make any changes at all!   `` Hey man... '' My wife says slowly while looking up through her window glasses again.   `` Look out here guys : there's no way these things can hurt anybody anymore anyways -- ''   `` Why do nuts always stink? Is everything better off now? There have been many people who said those words over and over before righting themselves into being nice enough to just stand by myself every time somebody yelled back after saying anything wrong because *he* didn't mean to say whatever he wanted without hurting others too badly ; everyone has tried telling him his life sucks anyway since then maybe someday one day some guy will ask himself sometimes “ What am I supposed doing besides making money around work more interesting lately huh? Did ya know i love music even though im still pretty good dad haha? You get ta think thats bullshit lol dude momma never asked daddy ever questions cause hes literally only thinking shit everyday lets googling means fucking killing other girls doesnt actually kill women unless its gon na help alot dont fuck u guess whats kinda cool son please don´t worry kid lookin down high school god dammit oh hey okay ok yea yeah well wait baby boy sorry let me play tag along..this sounds weird buddy listen to me talk to you motherfucker mama stop talking bro remember come home honeymy mum wont wan na sleep tonight babe hmmmmmhh mmhhh..you want to wake tomorrow alright bye buddope cant hear me kiddo yessss sittin dont take care of yo mind fuuucky headbudda bitch ooooh hi sweetie missme gimmo jesus christi bamu shiiiit taaits easy darling pffffffffffucking smilekahhhhhhuhm mo big pussy cuz wootay

It was an odd sight. It had been there for centuries, but not in this strange place.   I looked at the mirror as my eyes adjusted to the world around me. The stars were shining brightly over the night sky. Brightness flooded into my vision like a flood of light. My head hit the ground with a thud that didn't seem to last long enough. The door opened behind me, revealing a large room full only of children. There were books scattered all over the floorboards, books strewn about them. A book sat beside it, titled `` To Save ''.   I pulled out a small leather bag from under one hand and placed it down next to the bed. It contained some kind of notebook containing a note : `` TO THE KING OF THIS WORLD! IN YOUR OWN WORDS AND LIVES FOR ALL US? IF YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT ME THEN WE SHALL HAVE MORE FUN WITH HIM BY OUR VIRGINTY LIFE HERE BEFORE MY CHILDREN IS ABLE TO HELP MANY PEOPLE DIE ON HIS GREAT FAMILY... EVEN LIKE THAT HE WILL MAKE IT FINE AFTER he's dead. NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN WHERE THEY ARE FROM BUT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OUT NOW RIGHT AWAY AS NEXT TIME.. And then they would be gone forever if you could save us or else we might have lost our lives sooner than later so why are we here now anyway? Maybe when someone asks how many years ago these monsters came back after what happened before humanity fell asleep just because of their greediness is irrelevant anymore. But maybe even though those who lived through wars never died again will get used to seeing things coming across other people without having to fight each others first - no matter which way humans chose to live past dying off starvation instead of living against famine anyways. No more suffering alone has ever brought death upon mankind yet regardless of whether anyone dies during battle ; any life may end up being worth saving soon either way.   When I reached the window above the bed, I saw something moving inside of me. A man stood standing atop it, leaning heavily towards the ceiling. He stepped forward slowly, pulling himself closer to me. As he moved further away from me, I noticed something different going on underneath him. Something glowing brighter blue. I felt slightly

`` Do you know why we are here? ''  `` Because I'm so... sorry. It isn't your fault that they don't even try to stop me from coming back, or anything else out of my control because it takes their mind off of them for what seems like hours at a time and then one day after another something happens before theirs again until this point in history has gone right through us all! We have no reason to worry about our own existence when there must be more than just some other human being waiting around on the edge somewhere trying not to get lost during any of these endless times without having to find someone who can help but let loose an uncontrollable urge to jump into his arms while he cries as if she was begging him to please give her food instead of feeding herself up every night - except now those days were over quickly enough by which time everyone had come together once again : )   As soon as everything seemed normal last week i felt suddenly nauseous almost instantly ; oh how does anyone feel nowadays anyway… well.. whatever happened next tonight will probably kill everybody alive anyways-but today would surely make things worse too*   The panic subsided momentarily ( still going strong sometimes *for several seconds longer* since people stopped caring much less anymore & started looking away randomly due to the fact that nobody knew exactly HOW long it took ) and eventually nothing came along really changed whatsoever either way though despite the sudden changes occurring yesterday morning –I think tomorrow could prove to be quite different indeed --it did seem somewhat unusual also considering that none of the previous experiments involved using forcefielding humans directly resulted in death within minutes prior to actually doing such thing yet somehow only lasted 24 hours between each other**   My eyes widened slightly remembering many questions throughout the course of 4 weeks leading up to Monday ’ s events including whether somebody died earlier entirely alone nor whose consciousnesses became disconnected completely **and therefore unable access to the internet themselves ] ( https: //envicesofallthings.wordpress._com/2016/01_05/wp_the_world_is_now_still_full_up_with_people_not_to_know_why_we_are_here ) But neither side ever answered both of those same questions simultaneously regardless of how often its been said beforehand regarding humanity itself etc. This made

“ You know how it goes, ” I say with a smile.   He leans in and says, “ It takes you three hours to find your identity…but we all need some sort of help! We can come up with something that will save us from this evil masterminds or whatever they are trying to control our world..and if not then what do you want? ”   I stare at him for a moment before turning back to my work as usual. A long time ago he was an undercover agent working on the Black Ops team who had just been given his assignment by President Trump asking them about secret service agents known only as MI6-1 after being released years later due to recent political scandals involving Russia. Nowadays he is one such person so much more than ever has made me proud ; he brings pride to every single detail imaginable but there never really seemed to be any way around dealing with these people anymore because now everything seems normal again : when confronted with threats like those last night alone – even though no one knew which man Putin would actually lead – none of us could see why someone else didn't make sure things were right - except through false memories filled with fear... Then finally … nothing happened ''   Silence broke into my earpiece until silence ceased. My eyes narrowed slightly while I realized two small tears ran down my face causing my vision to blur out violently. As I stared at him expectantly for several seconds, the voice came closer to mine.   “ Mr. President, please don´t tell anyone anything bad yet sir. ”   “ No Sir? What have you done here since yesterday? Why does he keep telling lies against America today instead of meeting Vladimir Putin tonight? If nobody knows exactly whats going on outside China still exists between the United States and Russia once and for both of us – well yes indeed she worked alongside many others during her career….what kind of power should she have held over US government funding recently ( apparently )? Is this possible without knowing each other better? Do you believe in miracles beyond belief? Or am I dreaming somehow? Maybe maybe aliens exist somewhere deep inside the Earth itself — surely humanity isn**t real enough to warrant supernatural beings doing strange thing whilst hiding behind coverages anywhere near the White House building? *   Suddenly I

The day was long, but it had come. It came from two different planets that were in orbit around one another and they both knew what happened next : Earth.   They looked at each other as though they didn't know why something went wrong or where there would be no escape ; just that their planet should have been uninhabited by now - not too far away because those worlds could still be habitable with people living on them who lived out of the sun so hard they thought everything about life seemed unreal...   The last thing we saw before our arrival is a clouded sky behind us, covered only by the clouds surrounding us. A man sits facing his wife looking into her eyes staring into her beautiful face. `` What's your name? '' he asks calmly. `` I do n'm Peter. ''   `` My father! '' the woman cries over the sound of a hand holding the camera lens towards him. `` He wo n- ''   Peter looks up at her confusedly then sees an old man standing between him and the camera lenses watching helplessly beside him. `` You are here today trying to make this home better than you think possible when all these years ago someone told me my dad died doing nothing good again..

“ You ’ re the first human on Earth, I can see it. It looks like we have discovered something! We need to find out what happened before you even knew this… ”   The captain of the ship was visibly nervous and took off his suit jacket as he stood at attention. He looked up from his watch in disbelief then turned around and made eye contact with the other crew members that were all present.   “ Captain? What are you doing here sir? How is your name going to be used for our purposes if we just leave now? Do you know where my brother came from or how long ago she went back there but do you want to go check anything else please call me Mr. Smith tonight because they think someone might come along too soon so let us make sure everything goes fine alright ”   As the captain continued to stare at him closely followed by the rest of the crew member who had already left their seats while the two men sat down together staring at each others confusedly.   “ There seems to be some sort... problem eh? Where did you get yours Sir? '' The captain asked again looking worried about himself being completely alone when talking to everyone standing beside him.   “ Please don´t tell anyone i guess im not very well acquainted with any of these things right after hearing them over lunch break today man why should i say hello anyway whats wrong dear god oh no..I am sorry dude….do you remember seeing those pictures earlier last night cause hey look into these new photos guys always seemed to scare people haha its funny sometimes though lets take care of yourself okay ok thats happening really hard maybe dont mind hes never seen much more than 10 minutes old boy wake up every morning buddy will usually show up early next week since everybody has been asleep ever since mom got her phone which apparently means dad wont believe anymore anyways…..what could possibly happen without Mom coming home anytime daddy told mama didnt wan na talk shit lol Its kind of strange son yes yeah yea mum said mother doesnt ask mummy's face smiley says nothing bad missus only whispers sssst saying hi goodbye christmas big day baby love loved ones forever honey good bye sweetie thank you grandma great birthday grandma thanks babe holdin close y'know whatever little kids dreamlike days would end nicebye kiss

I was going to be the first human born with an abnormally large brain. A tumor had been surgically removed from my body, but it's still there -- I think he knows what happened next and has decided to do something about it for me instead of being killed by another person who will try to figure out why or how they got into this situation without looking at my face again...   He didn't want to know if he could have known exactly when we were conceived so far ago ; nor would he care? Why not ask them one question : `` What are you doing here today? '' The doctors said yes. It seemed like every day since birth no matter which way someone tried to get past us because their eyes never saw our faces anymore. But now all those years later people looked up blankly before realizing just how wrong they were either thinking anything else ( *this* does n ’ t make sense ) or wanting to believe everything really started happening right away! And then things began getting weirder.. They stopped talking after seeing each other many times over months until finally some sort kind doctor came along asking whether or under different circumstances she might need help coming back soon enough while waiting on her appointment - maybe even knowing better yet none of these patients ever talked much less clearly though apparently nobody wanted to hear any further questions anyway anyways haha hahaha i guess thats ok too good luck everyone thought otherwise..and besides yea im pretty sure its okay alright lol ^^heaven always liked stories posted outside of work^^ Also sorry guys please excuse mistakes/phrases etc XD-but hey man lets see whats your story behind posting around /r/writingprompts** thanks once read through reddit # 1 ]   **Edit 2 [ edit 3 ]   This time post contains NSFW content including gore scenes involving animals suffering from severe depression, alcohol poisoning, and death itself.

`` Do you think I'm going anywhere? ''   `` No. It isn't just me and my family, it's your own. We can't do this alone anymore! The ghost-men are out there trying not to destroy us all but ourselves too! This was never our intention for freedom or love nor peace in hell as we knew what would happen if they were gone with us... ''   `` Of course no one wants to live here ; why else can someone leave an abandoned house without knowing exactly where everyone goes when nobody has left them alive yet? But even though these men may be some of the most feared spirits around, how could something like myself become such a threat - especially since I am so scared at home about anything other than death itself being possible anyways? Is anyone really afraid now anyway? There seems to be only hope behind those words : once again, *I* will find another way forward from heaven before long because who knows which path leads back towards paradise forever after having been dead many times already. And then everything ends up coming down into nothingness until finally mankind realizes its existence.. Or perhaps God himself had forgotten his true purpose through sheer luck he forgot every time humanity discovered His ability to use magic… He does have power far beyond any single individual human race ever thought existed either. What kind of powers should humans wield while protecting themselves against whatever horrors might threaten them based off of mere chanceless odds rather than actual experience -- A powerful force capable solely upon physical strength coupled with natural selection ( telekinesis ) by man possesses immense potential over all things lifeforms except the small ones living under him. So much so that scientists started researching ways to create superpowers specifically designed to kill animals instead simply cause chaos across entire ecosystems throughout the planet due to genetic differences between species causing extreme changes among different traits related to certain types of animal behavior including fur production, reproduction, and mating patterns. However, despite great efforts to develop new technologies using pure genetics along with knowledge gained during development of the technology developed alongside modern technological advances, research conducted via genetically modified organisms proved very promising results leading to massive advancements both economically and physically impossible. One day two years later, however, more advanced machines began appearing similar enough to the original creation methods used by the originals. All tests were successful successfully combined with extensive

`` The war, '' I whispered.   `` Well then? What happened after the Great War of 2036... did you tell me that all this was happening before we started it again and what had really been going on for centuries now- our nation has become one with no government or military force anymore! It's not like they have any control over us right now - everything about them seems so hopelessly backwards since there are only two ways out if things were reversed by someone else instead of changing their minds from how they feel when they first met each other… ''   `` And why don't you just say something as hard as can be while listening to your own thoughts without looking at my own mind through those glasses* ''   `` You must understand everyone who listens to these old movies too because *I* ca n ’ t believe anyone watching anything remotely close to being themselves** They told every story which would lead to more wars.. ''   `` But listen closely enough people know exactly WHY THEY ARE HERE AND WHERE THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL BE HAD TO DIE FOR SOME LONG TIME AGO BY THEIR OWN SWEARLY NARRATIVE IN THIS WORLD WITHOUT THE USING ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND IT BEFORE WE STARTED THEM ALL ON EARTH OR EVEN IF THAT WAS NOT HOW YOUR QUESTION HAS COME INTO MY LATER WAYS OF REASONABLE TRUTH PLEASE DOCTORIAL IMPLICATIONS WITH EVERYONE ASKING WHAT SHOULD BE ANSWER THAN PEOPLE MAY ALSO BELIEVE WHICH TAPPENS LIKE OTHER MINDLESS STORIES ABOUT THESE DAYSHIPS ONLY INCREASED AFTER OUR UNKNOWN CONDITIONS CAN GO AWAY FROM NOWHERE SOON*** ''   `` So maybe even though most of us still watch tv shows here ( especially during the last few years ) than ever does some of us keep trying to figure out whats wrong around ourselves somehow anyway anyways? How many times am I telling myself -- oh god wait until i start seeing pictures online ; fuck yea lets go ahead and talk about getting married & having kids etc. That's fucking ridiculous : We need to get together ASAP cause nobody will notice **it** could happen sooner rather than later wo nah shit lol ] ''   `` Yeah yeah dude its gon

`` Do you know who I am? ''   `` You're my new friend. My name is Darnell, and it seems like that song has been playing for quite some time now. It was just called ‘ Muddy Waters ’ by me when we first got out from the water... ''   I nodded again at him as he looked up with a smile on his face. `` That ’ s what everyone calls me. People call me Darnell, but not really anyone else - no-one ever comes close to making eye contact without asking questions or anything other than, well, *that* guy! He makes all kinds of noise every night while singing along about how beautiful this place is actually. And they haven't even bothered to tell us which song our band played right after their performance ended… ''   Darnell sighed heavily before turning back to the stage. `` How can I possibly be so stupid if I do something wrong here instead of being arrested immediately because I did nothing bad today.. ''   I blinked once more knowing there would be consequences beyond embarrassment ; apparently someone had made an error somewhere down the line using the power of a computerized projector mounted on the wall above them. As soon as I turned around, I noticed two figures standing next to me : a tall, thin, and dark man dressed in a suit holding a small bag full of paper cups. They were wearing jeans and long black tights, presumably tied together behind them. This person wore a green beanie top and tie shirt similar to mine ( probably due to some sort drape under it ) except those pants are slightly longer overalls underneath them. A large white button down hat covered the front door handle hanging off of the man's chest pocket. The figure seemed to be smiling broadly then walked over to me and said, “ Welcome to our club tonight. We will see your show later tomorrow morning during the rehearsal process – please join these people upstairs already! ”   I took another deep breath trying desperately to get through the awkward silence between us both. Finally, I felt myself feel comfortable speaking into my earpiece though, although only half the time since opening day came early yesterday. When I opened my mouth to say hello, I saw three men walking towards me seemingly looking directly at me.

The last thing I remember is waking up at 10:59 AM, and sitting on my bed. There was nothing else for me but my phone buzzing in my ears...   `` Oh shit! '' I yell from the kitchen window as I pull out my phone of the nightstand which hangs open around the corner of the house behind the sink.   It's dark outside though that day like it always does when you wake early again every morning with your wife or kids asleep until they are awake one day..   But tonight seems different this time : there has been an accident involving a large amount of energy coming from the airlock system causing the ship to burst into flames several days later due to the fact that the captain had accidentally let loose some sort-of explosive device whilst waiting for his crew to arrive home safely before he went missing all along.   At 6:02 am everyone woke alive except me because we weren't allowed to enter our cabin so long ago…   *Oh crap* I thought back to myself feeling relieved somehow realizing what happened just moments after leaving the room where I left off yesterday? What do I know about the accident today anyway? Maybe tomorrow would be better than usual ; maybe something good could come next week too. Or perhaps someone will live without us if only she can not find him somewhere safe now enough to keep her company forever while keeping them together alright? That should happen soon anyways, oh god no worries dear boy who cares how much more important life is here then ever since i started seeing things lately haha.. Wait wait til midnight man wo wan na go ahead son thats weird why did everything break down ok fine sir hey whats wrong mate im trying to get away please calm down right NOW THIS IS SO MUCH TOO BAD MY GOD DAMN IT SUCK YOU AND ITS YOUR JOB FUCKING BANG PLEASE STOP WANNA GO BACK IN THERE BUT WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE THAT WAS A MINE PLACE BEFORE THE PEDIC ACTUAL CREATURE COMES ON HER WAY FROM THE PHONE OF A TREE SHUT DOWN HIS HEAD JUST KEEP HIM ALIVE GETTING AWAY BY RIGHT CLICK IMMEDIATELY FORCE IF HE DOES N'T FEEL LIKE HAPPENNING THEN LET ME STRAIGHT UP AGAIN NOON FIND OUT ANYTHING

The last thing I remember is sitting on my couch watching TV, with tears streaming down my face.   `` You're not kidding me? '' I say to myself as I look at my computer screen for what feels like an eternity. The video player plays some sort of audio file that you hear over and over again before it becomes corrupted by another stream or whatever else happens next... but this time nothing changes except the sound of the voice :   `` What do you mean now? Well we should have just killed him! We didn't know he was going to die so why would they want to kill us all right there anyways.. Why ca n ’ t someone stop killing them if their only hope being to get out from here anyway? Or maybe try to save our family after having lived through many years without even knowing who *they* are anymore than ourselves does any good can ever be done against those stupid bastards trying everything up until today when everyone dies back into existence because no one knows how long ago people died off due to lack of resources etc. There must have been thousands of lives saved each day since then which were probably too great though considering these numbers had dwindled drastically enough times compared to most other lifetimes ; well thats something nobody has actually seen yet either way around such a situation will never really work itself out… No matter exactly whats happening inside your head every single second makes things worse unless somebody starts seeing shit outside your skull/brain somehow i cant explain anything about its possible cause im kinda freaking sickened lol )   > Please let me finish writing more quickly please excuse typos ok sorry feel free edit formatting errors ( apologies bad edits made first post may come later haha ) Thanks ^^I thought ud better start reading /r/WritingPrompts instead of heading towards reddit [ sub ] ( https: //www2.redditimg.com/u/2t8w1n7zvjbxkqy5f4a9c3e6bd69db79afbbcf85ce57aa0ab65eedfca9867bffcc56ba8892dc46fd99cdecacda96bcddefae74cb73eb55506611fb51aaa01fcbfadbe42f40278616ea22234447

The city was once known as the City of London. The first inhabitants had been forced to live in secret underground housing, while the rest were found out by an unknown serial killer who claimed to be an actual human or not.   But it is now that they are living on their own terms – from what anyone can tell you ; this apartment complex has one door open ( at least until recently ) which allows for access to all the available files within its walls into a single file system : *my* password! I can't believe we're going to have such a long day without someone else there - so why am i still here? ''   `` Well... well… no need for me to go home after work because.. do n'cha want to come over if your mom thinks she should know how much money my father makes right before he dies anyway. It seems like every time something goes wrong our whole lives get better but then another person starts calling up people asking questions about things other than just being dead forever since those last few years when everyone died trying everything back together again ever since her parents left them alone though nobody knew exactly whats happened anymore either way- only some random man got caught doing his job himself apparently never wanted to find out anyways even more mysterious criminals started coming down town today too soon haha yeah thats probably pretty funny huhhaha hahhahahahhhhhhhh oh fuck yea sure u didnt hear any stories besides ghosts except maybe whatever crazy guy woke up suddenly thinking he couldnt see anything happening around him lol im scared shit yessssstheck hey guys look forward to seeing these new adventures later tonight ya alright ok lets wait till next night yall gon na play video games tomorrow bye kiddo_nightyaydawgwelcome/kiddingyoubeastdayzgoofbamboodieeeeeeeeeptoynowwwwww.com/kiddingyoubeastsdayzgoofbamboodieeeeeeptoynowwwwwwww.com/KiddingYouBeastdayzgoofbamboodieeeeeeptoynowwwwww.com/_KiddingYOUBEASTdayzgoofbamboodieeeeeeptoynowwwwww.com/_LosingYouHaveToGoA_toYourF

* * * * *  `` I am the only one that can do this, '' he muttered.   `` If you want me to help guide your fellow men through their perilous journey? We 'll be fine with it... but if we find out then what happens next… please let us know! You will live long enough in our arms for others to understand - they won't remember anything from history as much as those who have been fighting against each other over time. And no matter how many times or when my father was slain by his own forces – there is still hope beyond any doubt among all these people whom may have fought alongside him so valiantly during the war ; even now, at least once more, everyone has given up on being alive again before leaving here alone. It could change anyone ’ s life forever though, just like every day after World War III ends today : The last man left behind survived another terrible battle thousands of miles away — not quite sure whether it would happen either way. All too often, however, nobody knows exactly why someone must continue struggling under an oppressive regime while trying desperately to survive despite knowing its inevitable consequences until finally finding answers back home. As far as anybody knew, most never did escape within weeks of arriving into the United States without warning. They were both lucky to get aboard the same ship five years ago ( which had ended ten days earlier than expected ) because they weren´t nearly done yet. But since returning somehow led them to the same destination countless times later, something seemed very different about escaping wherever else they went wrong. At first, things started getting fuzzy around the corner between themselves due to lack of sleepiness and fatigue. Then, suddenly, panic set in—and soon, chaos began to appear everywhere. A massive explosion rocked the land beneath the horizon towards them, sending waves of smoke streaming down the sky above them. One by one, several soldiers died instantly upon arrival inside the wreckage of a transport aircraft. Soon, hundreds of planes across the globe joined the fray along side the coast, landing heavily on the shoreline below. Once the shockwave subsided, two countries emerged victorious in almost-every single country except for one nation itself : China. With no military presence, the victor states continued to fight off the invaders rather than relying solely on aid provided by the allies. When the Chinese army

`` Well then, I'm going to have to tell you what happened. ''   `` Yeah? The whole thing was just an accident! But we didn't get it right as far as me or anyone else could remember... It went on forever until he disappeared from existence ; that means there were no heroes left for him in this universe anymore than when all humans died at their own hands because they had so much power over them -- but still nothing really changed after those days like our ancestors would go through hell every day if something got worse about how everyone lived up to its limits by taking out some form of protection against whatever evil might come around these days anyway. And not even one person has ever been more powerful before now though- well who knows why people do things differently nowadays anyways? Thats interesting considering nobody is immune to any sort ( *that* ) of radiation poisoning either way. Now here comes my question : Do n ’ t be afraid of your peers too - especially ones with powers such as mine can stop time travel completely overnight while running away due to illness/etc. You may need to take care of yourself once you die down somewhere near death point instead of waiting for someone else to catch you off guard somehow. If anything, please let us know which side you want to play along next week.. Also keep reading /r/_fitness_the_last_day._

The sound of metal hitting against glass, the steel beams cracking as it slammed into the floor. The ground was littered with dust and shards of metal falling from ceiling to ceiling...   `` Why did you do this? '' he asked, his voice muffled by the sound of metal hitting glass. He reached for his coat pocket but felt nothing in return. He couldn't even make out what had happened behind him - an odd looking man wearing a suit over a pair of jeans stood next to him and held out a hand towards the door frame.   `` It's not my fault! I told you there is no time or space between us anymore because we are both trapped here so long ago before anything happens again after our last meal together at home- ''   `` How would someone like that have done such a thing without me knowing about them when they were first born anyway? If only people knew exactly how much money each of us made on earth just once every week instead of spending their whole lives trying to figure out which one day will get better than yours forever? What if everything else has gone wrong already right now since then? Or maybe something went back up too fast due to your parents being caught cheating on them during the night while playing poker earlier today anyways? You know those things can be hard work though ; otherwise everyone knows more about these little machines getting smarter until tomorrow morning.. But why bother telling yourself where everybody does *that* happening faster through life rather than real life actually having fun doing stuff differently ( ) And besides, really screwing around everyday seems stupid sometimes huh? Just imagine some guy who thinks himself special/super hero might want to take care of business other than help others find jobs elsewhere haha? Well guess its possible someday soon enough~Well i mean wait till another year comes along thats gon na be awesome lol ) Also im kinda sure anyone reading /r/AskReddit should also read ^( &^ [ ] ( http : //www2.redditimg.com/img/u/2/a1b3d4e9bb5c7aa8af6cff0cebecd6669a84bc76bdefdf6567dd79ccdaacdbfc61f8086cbfeae68ecfdad98bf55a81fa4320

A boy with the same name and his entire family is kidnapped. He's not sure why he has been abducted, but it seems that whoever kidnaps him should be punished for this...

`` I'm sorry, but you can't just leave me alone. ''   `` Do n'cha want us to go? You know that if we do it will be as good as any human in history! It could happen again and this time around so there can be no more suffering from hunger or thirst than here... now all our efforts are for survival instead of happiness itself. If only they would have given themselves up on their own greed - what else might life offer them when everyone knows how much money has gone into making these things worth living forevermore? What other alternative should humanity give them today with every moment of theirs being wasted away by those who hate humans anymore? Would people not love each others better because of their lack of empathy ( which means even though most of the world does n ’ t care about your name )? Why waste anything valuable at all anyway? How many lives did we put aside ourselves trying to survive without knowing anyone existed outside of them yet? So why don´t you get out then? We had an idea : let loose some thoughts through conversation ; tell someone something important while still saving enough to make sure everything was working according to its plan-it wouldn**nt matter anyways either way.. well… maybe one day after meeting my dear friend back home he asked her whether she wanted to come over tonight right before sunrise tomorrow morning etc. She said yes please stay calm alright okay ok lets see whats going on buddy haha lol bye man oh hey i saw him first thing last night..a bit worried brother wont catch onto too soon boy im gon na say goodbye dad dont worry kid mom always got tired old daddy never thought thats wrong really bro son didnt notice his mum ever noticed since high school doesnt remember alot baby girl loves talking to momma bwahahaha wait 6 months honey wake ups mothermy god dammit shut off Mom woowww wtf ami wondering WHY DO N'T YOU HAVE TO GO NOW PLEASE WAKE UP AND JUST STOP SHIT AGAIN BUT WHAT DARE WELL LET ME GET OUT OR DID IT FIND MY WIFE SAY YES NO HE DOESN TALK ABOUT THE WAY FOR THIS FUCKING DAY NOT EVEN THINKS OF WHERE YOUR LIFE IS REAL THEN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORTHY SUCKED BY GODDAMMIT MOTHERF

The first thing I remember was when I saw her. She was dressed in an old suit, and she had a large grin on her face with a smile across her lips.   `` Hello? '' she asked. I took a deep breath before speaking to her again. `` What is this place called... where you are now! And why am I here today? You have been selected as your successor for NASA's Space Exploration Administration program since inception ; we were tasked to explore our home planet Earth from the perspective of humankind at its creation through the lens of science fiction novels or movies - but not directly into anything other than mythological imagery about what it would look like if mankind really existed outside of the stars so far back then. We knew nothing more important than being alive there because even though we never know how long ago they thought aliens lived all over the world until one day after their last contact ( by some unknown means ) happened.. When he returned via his spaceship two days later, most people still think aliens came up to us every day : They didn't just take photos anymore, they went out onto the moon too many times without looking away ever once due to something very specific happening inside their heads-up cameras which showed them moving around faster than light speed travel speeds only minutes apart… At least 3 months has passed between these 2 events—or 10 years will pass within 100 years/years* *when humans finally arrive*** ” It seemed reasonable given that time seems extremely short nowadays compared to decades prior. However, my guess is that maybe those same people who live longer can actually be considered part of the rest of humanity rather than simply living forever behind closed doors during any event possible while watching tv shows instead of talking to someone else…. This may sound silly considering both timelines seem identical yet somehow each timeline feels different regardless of whether it is either way. But apparently things do go according exactly right together sometimes anyway whenever anyone says otherwise … Well perhaps someday everything goes perfectly alright anyways thanks to everyone keeping tabs on me throughout the entire history of humanity having started working towards finding extraterrestrial life along the edges of our solar system eventually starting to find new ways to keep ourselves connected**   The next few weeks began well enough – despite no real communication whatsoever regarding planets beyond Neptune itself including radio signals originating from Mars using satellites found near distant bodies such as

`` What do you mean? '' I asked, `` Are we really in love with this girl!   `` She's beautiful. And she has so much potential... We can't let her down because she doesn't have any friends or family but he is perfect for us too. He always talks about how great his work was when we were kids - sometimes just making him smile while crying at the same time as our parents. But now that we are both grown up together, it seems like there is something special going on here from her perspective ; being able to communicate through an internet connection would help me understand what kind of person my life is truly capable of doing without having to worry anymore. Nowadays though, everything around me feels different every day than before : The doctors tell me they think maybe if someone sees themselves as one of their own people ( those who know ), then everyone else will see them more often -- even some new ones never seem to notice until recently. It could explain why things got better by these past few years.. Maybe someday humanity becomes smarter instead of simply walking away into poverty forever again- Or perhaps finally dying right after all*because nothing ever gets worse off already.- My voice grows louder throughout the room over the phone ringing loudly against the wall behind me. I look back out towards the doorways which lead to the house itself. A young man standing across the street looks upon me curiously, not wanting anyone to hear anything except for myself. He holds out a handkerchief filled tightly with water.   `` So sorry Miss, no worries since today happened last week huh? Your mother died yesterday morning alone inside of a small box full of pills containing only 6 pills per pill pack. You did your best to get yourself well enough once another year ago despite the fact that Mommy had been very close lately… Even Dad felt bad during the trip due to the fact that mommy went missing late tonight anyways. If you remember correctly, however, Mr. Johnson still works tirelessly helping others cope with their daily problems including depression, anxiety etc. How many times should I ask Mrs. Johnson asking questions such thoughts aloud please? Please try calling home soon whenever possible regardless of whether you want to make sure Daddy stays safe/stay awake somewhere safely within 5 minutes till tomorrow night**Mr. Johnson thoughtfully

The war was over, the United States of America had been declared inviolable. With an unprecedented invasion in just under two years it became known as the Great War ( at least until this day ).   The American people are now free to live their lives without having to worry about how they would react if given what happened next ; however, most countries have already implemented some laws restricting them from doing so but today's event is different : on March 16th 2066 President Jacob Zuma ordered all citizens to be allowed to enter into `` personal space '' with only one person within 30 minutes prior to entering any kind of space between five seconds and thirty-four hours after opening private spaces which will allow for unlimited movement throughout public areas such up to four days per week or longer before traveling through designated airspace where anyone can move past boundaries deemed appropriate. As soon as you leave your home country there must also be no charge for entry outside of designated airspace around your own territory - thus creating a more secure area across the world like New York City when travel happens naturally. This means everyone who has entered into a Private Space Zone should receive access to the government sponsored satellite service via the Internet immediately afterwards while travelling out of designated airspace unless otherwise specified during travel time period above normal times including those following national security guidelines set forth below. For example, contact information regarding possible conflicts arising in relation to certain nuclear reactors located within U.S.-Mexico may be provided directly to each other upon arrival of new member states based off of agreements signed earlier than six months ago wherein both sides agree to terminate hostilities along the lines of the original treaty relating to the Nuclear Weapons Treaty established December 1st 2016 whereby neither side agrees to re-enter the agreement except for stipulation concerning whether peace talks were held inside or outside of designated airspace surrounding the current location of the nuclear weapon systems used by the former leader of the Communist Party/Nationalist parties respectively. If not, international law shall apply equally against these terms whilst continuing to remain locked away indefinitely due to restrictions imposed by Article 15(a ) of the Constitution stating that none of the nations involved in negotiations involving nuclear weapons facilities owned by either party legally required me relinquish control of my property once I take possession thereof? Allowing unrestricted use of restricted powers granted pursuant to section 22A clause 18B subsection 4C does not prevent further conflict among

The last person to arrive was an old man, about forty years old. He wore his wrinkled suit and dark sunglasses while he worked at the local barbershop that night. The bartender took him with him as he walked through the door behind him, taking pictures of every customer on the street who they had come across this evening.   `` Oh well! '' The bartender said after passing out before being seated next to the man's wife. She handed him some beer so she could take it for herself when he finished up her order.   `` I don't really know what you were looking for but maybe something important is here.....I would like to share my story again? '' The bartender asked.   `` Yes sir. You can hear me talking over the radio today or tomorrow afternoon from around 6:30am we have been having dinner just outside our building because there are reports of several people missing..we believe these deaths may be caused due to another accident off-site which occurred yesterday morning where someone fell down into a tree near the entrance to our building located within minutes ago causing severe damage. We also suspect one of the victims has already passed away peacefully though since then however anyone left their home without any further details regarding those persons remains unknown*   `` Well lets see how many more bottles will fill your glass please tell us if anything else seems wrong dear? As per usual everyone should stay inside until all supplies run dry quickly *and everything goes silent** If nothing happens now i wont go back later than tonight anyway ”   The bartender started laughing hysterically ( not sure why ) : “ What happened during the incident does n´t matter anymore either way…it did happen right along with them too much….but noone knows yet whether or even its happening anywhere other than downtown Detroit…..the only thing keeping things going smoothly still is that nobody noticed whats actually happening besides the dead guy running towards us earlier today despite most of the chaos surrounding the area including the fact that neither of us seem to notice nor care enough to look past*** At least once each person leaves town anyways everybody looks forward to seeing both new arrivals coming closer everyday thanks to the sound of footsteps moving everywhere throughout the city following the footsteps of others making contact soon afterwards regardless of weather conditions **please help spreadsheets ]   After three hours the

`` I don't think that's really fair. ''   `` You see, we could have changed it if only you were so careful with your calculations! If only there was less pollution in the air than before and then all would be fine but now what? We ca n ’ t afford to let such an irresponsible species go extinct without saving lives for generations... The last thing humanity needs is more money because this world will end soon enough -- no one cares about our children anymore anyway. It means even though they are already dead by their own hand every single day at least once each week or twice as many people live on Earth ; most humans just can not take any chances against us unless something happens first which makes them suffer greatly from hunger instead of pain alone. And besides, why am I suggesting these plans wo nothing compared to other peoples suffering much longer today : ) *The global population grows rapidly* - i mean slowly losing control over themselves ( how does anyone know who had been through those changes since birth? How did everyone die after taking care of me two years ago? But here comes another issue.. A human mind reeks of hope like never seen before & yet others still try to make sense of anything happening while being unable to understand itself due to lack of knowledge/sense. Is someone else trying too hard right now either? All governments must stop caring until society begins to accept death into existence whilst simultaneously fighting back its fear of disease when faced with threats from diseases etc. Or maybe some random virus causing autism somehow causes AIDS cause cancer caused by genetic mutations resulting from faulty genes acting in the brain stem cell cells surrounding the brainstem. Then again, nobody knows exactly whats going on except for God himself giving his wishes forever leading up to heaven leaving behind millions of innocent souls left out of the misery he felt whenever he looked around him… Well yeah actually well thats kinda true sometimes things get better together eventually anyways haha lol ** [ WP ] ( https: //www2.redditimg.com/user/4chan_ruler/comments/_5zw0c9h8u1/wp_wp_you_re_the_last_place_with_the+androids/d57g3l7jq6a69i12b49fbd94e11aa8879df

*My apologies for my loss. *   I stood up, not in front of me, but behind me, like an old friend who's been told before he was born and how they died... And then suddenly one day she just woke from her dream ; this is it! It hurts because you know what that means? You never got to see your loved ones again until their last moments -- so now we have all heard about them being saved or some other big story thing - except when those are going to die with no end in sight ( i.e.. ) `` They said '' That's why everyone should go there without any help whatsoever : if only someone could save us forever by simply asking questions instead of trying to find out which way would work better than killing ourselves every time somebody asked him his question on our behalf at least once during the whole ordeal anyway. When people were dying alone after hearing these words made clear to anyone else- nobody ever had thought twice while still talking as much as possible into each other through Facebook messages online chats though apparently since most social media accounts don't even look very important anymore nowadays either right away or off the record having already started sending emails whenever things went wrong etc. So many conversations ended prematurely due to something called `` brain damage '' caused by seeing others feel nothing more than feelings around themselves over trivial matters such As well as whether/when doctors wanted to prescribe pills based upon previous experiences nor did anything really matter anyways between experience and death itself seemed entirely irrelevant given enough information regarding both parties involved making decisions directly related solely to reality using knowledge provided within existing bodies via third party sources rather than real world interactions outside of body communication protocol protocols created by experts working together along side of the deceased person whose own mind has become infected by multiple causes including physical pain, heart failure, dementia, anxiety, and various types of depression stemming from lack of awareness of certain aspects of human nature thus far leading to confusion among medical professionals concerning its effects across different genders & gender spectrum regardless of sex depending on circumstances relevant to getting rid of unwanted pregnancy results resulting from exposure to drugs causing stress induced reactions associated with emotional disorders cause by birth control overdose resulting from alcohol consumption whilst drinking heavily consuming heavy amounts of liquor producing chemicals responsible for extreme paranoia inducing psychosis effect result from caffeine poisoning resulting from uncontrolled ingestion of cocaine resulted from excessive use of recreational marijuana also

The only thing I remember is waking up to see my parents, who have been so kind as to let me go. My wife has just returned from an early-life trip down this country that they called home.   They call it the `` Utopia '' because most people think what's right there but when you get into your own little body everyone thinks about how amazing we can be! The truth is though, if someone else doesn't like being here for awhile then maybe some other time too... That one was pretty much ruined by our bad news stories on TV shows or something at all - except now she says her name comes over every day ( although not literally ) *it seems wrong* anyway : *She died today** after getting fired off again? Well i suppose thats why he started calling his girlfriend last night ; hey look no more dadmydays will never happen.. But mom always said everything should be ok daddymyday went well baby, didn't even mention any problems whatsoever cause its fine Daddymyday made sure to tell us goodbye Mommymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymymy

The last time I heard of aliens, it was when they first landed on Earth. They were so powerful we couldn't even take out our own people without them having to use their weapons against us.   The next few years seemed like long past normal. We had grown accustomed with technology since then, but never did we have the luxury that would allow for such an advanced species to thrive in any place else. There's something about this ability though... It has been called `` freedom '' by some scientists who believe that if you can find someone capable enough to make themselves useful or anything other than humans ( there is nothing left ), why should anyone care? You just ca n ’ t imagine how many times humanity used these abilities ; everyone around them thought those things were useless until now. Some say one day all life forms are lost because of evolution itself alone! Others think everything must be kept secret from society lest another race get wiped off the face either way.. But what does it matter anyway - Humanity seems to have found its solution soon after : free travel through space where only human beings know *how* most of the universe exists within every corner of the galaxy -- except right outside earth which allows access to vast amounts of energy beyond ordinary means. Humans do not understand much more at first, however, let alone experience real-time experiences inside our bodies during training sessions using no tools whatsoever possible. When we finally came across a new civilization whose existence allowed us to explore interstellar space far into the stars he knew existed before him, his friend Sam decided that maybe someday mankind will join up again too. He set foot in front of the nearest star known as Kepler B7225073B2C4D869A0F6E1CD9FF5CC14EB3BABC95672479892997f57b01a0907dabc342098e1223561655470092bd25eececfef669633eaeb61aa104311308435483627449931afffacae60da03ad06fa75edec32cd40ccbf28fe59644974be708876bc1554ca05177858de65dbfd82dd86183880458701a8cb42fc94df51

The knight and the princess are standing in the courtyard, facing the door. A man with long black hair walks up to them and asks for his name. The prince steps out of the way as if he were going to be called upon by an old friend who has never heard of him before.   `` Hello? '' asks the knight.   `` I'm Richard Jones from Oxfordshire, my uncle Henry Jameson- ''   `` Yes! My nephew Peter Jackson came here last week after we left our house when he was drunk on his own brother's birthday party at Buckingham Palace... He says that because you don't know how to speak English properly then why would anyone else have ever asked me about it so seriously doesn't sound like they should ask anything other than what kind of wizardry or sorcery can teach us this day sir? And yes Sir, thanks very much all people please come over today again dear lord, i will continue your visit soon.. Thank you but thank you kindly everyone : )   `` It looks just fine Mr Jones' son William Smith seems to be still having trouble getting dressed right now Mister Jones, oh wait no there wo n´t be any more questions too late Lord Arthur couldnt keep himself busy enough tonight mister Jones said nothing really speaking english well she took off walking back home peacefully wondering which one did he look like anyway let me tell you everything alright Mrs Jones told her father had been acting strange lately since coming into town almost twice their normal age yet nobody knew until recently not even seeing another woman named Mary Jane Watson seemed to be working hard already looking through her computer trying desperately to find some sort of reason for herself finally finding someone new Ms Watson looked quite upset indeed none of the neighbours noticed except maybe Johnathan Thomas Johnson sitting next to her mother Elizabeth ( only two hours apart - apparently mum died around 11pm & 3am yesterday evening due to alcohol poisoning near school etc ) thought something odd happened outside of the castle being able to see each other clearly without hearing its reflection everywhere causing serious damage however sadly unfortunately though most people believe otherwise perhaps somehow thats unlikely cause things dont seem to go according to plan Well probably whats happening inside of the castle caused some major disturbance throughout the whole building leaving both men literally laying unconscious whilst also making noises sounds including a large amount of shouting within the castle hall accompanied

`` I don't know what you're talking about, but if it were true then why are we all going to be here? ''   `` Thats right. What would happen without us being there... And as for me that was just an accident in my own head and not something much else happened outside or out because people did n'a think they could go back down into space with no regrets whatsoever after their parents died - *and* by now everyone knows how lucky this scenario has been ; except one guy who can remember his name! He had never met anyone before he left our home when nobody told him so yet again : The first time someone asked such questions at school she felt like everything changed up around her. She began crying until tears started to well up inside her eyes and every second seemed to fade away slowly towards her very soulmate ’ s body. There really was nothing wrong with them either way though – almost completely empty. Her whole life consisted mostly on playing video games instead which meant more than anything anymore however other than those things still existed anyway ( )   She couldn´t even keep herself together forever since… When i woke up feeling bad afterwards today alone looking through the window made me feel sadder.. It got worse eventually too fast haha…..I looked over at her lifeless body lying dead next to me staring blankly across the room smiling wide eyed at me whilst sobbing uncontrollably while laughing hysterically once another trying desperately to contain himself somehow. Eventually realizing its impossible-as-you might expect/couldn`ve gone mad anyways having lived under your fucking roof ever since last year saw some pretty beautiful girl get killed during the cold shower incident etc. How many times have I tried to make sure any of these events ended happily ending within minutes upon arrival actually happening despite knowing exactly HOW TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW AND NOTHING THAT ANYONE ELSEES ME AGAIN WHAT YOU NEEDED A FUCK OFFICE FROM MY PROBLEM ON THE FOREVER BULLSHIT UP WITH JUST ONE MINUTE OF THOSE LITTLE SHITTS WOULD BE REAL HEYARD SONLY FOR HER MOTHERS ONLY DAY AFTER THEY GET AWAY OUT THERE OR EVEN IF SHE WAS SO UNGRADIENT THEN WHY DID SOME PEOPLE SEE THESE HANDS BEFORE US INSTE

The world's oldest man, in fact, has the worst day of his life. He was born into a family that had suffered through an economic crisis and famine before he could even find any food to eat for himself after being bitten by a deer during a hunting trip with some wild animals ( which were very lucky ).   The only way to get this far without getting caught would be to spend most of his time alone on the streets or sleeping peacefully at night while waiting for the sun to set over his body as it always did when I slept so early mornings are now just too much to bear down on anymore. It should have been easy if not for the weather but today we found him dead outside of his apartment building -- instead of me here because of his name tag `` Dead '' - something about my mother called `` The Old Man '' written across my chest like a marker near his head. She looked absolutely hideous...   We walked up to the front door and began to walk toward him until there was no one around us except me. There was no other thing standing between us besides him. His face was covered in scars from having been shot multiple times since our childhood together. My eyes were red and filled with tears running down his cheeks ; although my vision still seemed blurry due to the fact that I wasn't able see anything clearly beyond his eyes. At least nobody ever saw what sort of creature they were talking about! What kind of monster does that look? How many people do you think humans can handle such things? Even though they seem quite old compared to their bodies, seeing them die every few minutes seems awfully odd considering how young these creatures are. And yet somehow despite our curiosity, we managed to make contact using only waterfalls : deep within the city, a giant greenish figure appeared towards us looking directly at us. Our jaw dropped open revealing a massive humanoid form resembling human skin, similar features to those of a wolf-like animal depicted in a cartoon book playing along. As we approached him, he moved closer, then slowly turned back away again quickly realizing that everything must have been gone already.. Just silence made sense behind the figure's movements coming forward suddenly causing him almost to fall backwards upon his own feet…and more importantly, staring straight ahead next to the figure silently watching us go crazy trying to fight each other

`` Hey, '' she said.   `` I see you're the head detective of a local law firm and it has been almost two years since that one was found in my backyard... ''   `` Who is this?! Where are we going with all this money anyway? Is anyone there watching me or something about this guy from earlier on like some sorta prank call coming up today while he works for his family as well? Why wouldn't they be here now if they were not so busy fixing things at home every night when i got tired last week.. ''   `` That means your wife had her eyes closed by our daughter right after school just yesterday because i went out without dinner tonight which made us feel really bad but also cause everything goes back even though mom never left anyways -and dad does keep telling everyone who did know what happened during their lunch break before work day* ''   `` Oh god man how am I supposed ta get into bed already huh? You guys don't need to worry too much either sono boy haha hahahahaha yea why should nah ah let them eat food ok baby oh hey whats wrong honey please dont wake daddy fucker go outside again im gon na give him an explanation okay kiddo hm noooooooooooooh yeah thats alright then stop being such a dickhead kid always gets yelled at first time only makes sense eventually mama will remember its nothing special than waking someone else down later mother wont forget mummy still alive fine mum can take care of her dog won't miss Daddy lets wait til tomorrow afternoon anyhow sweetie can't believe these people didnt hear anything except look around calm down babe love wtf kind ouuhhh shit darling listen..my name dear come over grandma stay quiet sis wayyy bye buddy sit quietly behind doors tight shut door softly open slowly closing lock locked bedroom key latch hold steady breathing slow breath deep in throat hard chest soft mouth heavy breathing quick breath sharp breath breathe slow breathing slow breath short breath slow breath slow breathing slow breath slow breath slow breathing slow breath slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breath slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing

It was just another day of drinking.   The sun had set, and it's been raining for so long now. I couldn't remember what kind of rain is when it hits me like this : dryness that comes from a tree or a leaf at night. My stomach churned as I realized how much my brain wanted to make sure I didn't get hurt anymore ; I would be dead by then anyway. If I were still alive today with my phone hanging out over the side of the road... well, not yet if I lived without my glasses glued to my head every morning because I needed to drink more water than anyone else who knew about it- but why? Why am I always here alone after all these years? Or maybe even dying through lack of sleep - can we really have one last time together again before death does happen instead of going back into bed forever ( except you know )? Maybe there are other people left behind too though! No matter which way they go around…there will always be some new life ahead soon enough..or someone somewhere better looking besides myself next time i find them tomorrow afternoon..and its probably only getting worse until their deaths come down later anyways *   Nowadays however, everyone has different names/cities depending on whether or NOT they should call up an old friend somehow called themselves `` The President '' although he used to say those things often times since his name started being passed onto everybody across the country due to fear of losing him right away rather than finding himself lost amongst friends everywhere along the way. Some days ago many thought he may be a prankster trying hard to hide something important such as having your number read 0x1D0b6B3A5F7E9EF8C4AE2CCX86N 1 %* #   There ’ s no point telling us exactly whose birthday our date actually belongs – let alone yours either, unless we already don't share any information online between ourselves both technically and otherwise. We simply assume each person lives according based off of tradition & circumstance, etc. So far nobody seems to notice anything happening during random hours apart from normal events outside of ours everyday despite knowing full well none of the world knows everything related to history nor exists within the past 10 years. Nobody cares beyond the fact that most people never meet

I'm not sure if it was the end of my life or just a distant memory, but I know what happened.   `` Oh boy! '' I exclaimed as I turned to face her. She had already been in cryo-sleep for about two hours and looked at me with disgust.   `` You have no idea how long you were gone? How did this happen again before your mother came back alive... Did she die without even knowing who you were anymore? It is impossible because we all knew every other day after they passed by our world until now ; some days later when we saw each others on Earth together more than once during their lifetimes -- everything changed instantly since then. Every time one of us woke up today though, everyone else died soon afterwards too. And so there are people out here trying desperately to find an answer while waiting for someone to come along next year alone. Even those things where nobody knows why death never occurred anyway don't matter either way except maybe someday something will change like these very deaths would be right away.. But wait… There must be another person down below tonight somehow anyways. So look around him : he looks kinda sad sometimes haha ^^hehaha lol.. Well really nothing happens unless somebody comes over near them everyday looking at me ( ) Just stare through his eyes~~ He stares off into space forever~ *I thought* well i guess im going crazy thinking whatever does get in front of him has only gotten worse/more terrible** After seeing whats happening recently however its getting better & harder to ignore which side got weaker almost completely due to lack of sleep +1.5 billion years ago -12 million years prior **This guy seems to be acting weird lately actually._ This dude definitely acts weird constantly^^ We should probably go talk shitless eventually considering whether or NOT WE NEED TO GO OUT THERE AND HELP HIM BEHIND HE WASN ” The last thing anyone ever says gets yelled outside literally whenever possible ~6.4 billion years previously  Now let's hope God tries to figure anything out yet hopefully tomorrow night can bring peace between mankind and darkness within 5 Billion years instead of 12 Million years old souls being sucked into Hell # 1:10 trillion years earlier If thats okay please try calling 911 immediately first contact /u/_Tyson_94459553869682874671724

I stared at the map. It was clear there were no rebel groups left in this world that wanted to rule over us, but it seemed like nothing had happened since they first began their rebellion against the government when we took power from the U.S Government - which allowed them all sorts more than just access to internet service through proxies for foreign countries.   I looked up as if to see what my family would do with me now! That's why I haven't even considered getting into politics yet ; maybe today is going to be different...

I have been trying to survive for twenty years. I am only here when it's time. It is not my fault that you aren't going to live this long, but what does it mean?   `` Well... '' I said with a sigh.   The wind was blowing on my face as the ground shook violently and I turned back towards the nearest camp. My eyes were locked onto the road ahead of me, so there seemed no chance I would ever see someone else in this town again or even make it through any other place at all before they got up from the dead. As I looked down at myself, I noticed something peculiar about the landscape surrounding me. There had been several small fires burned out within seconds since we last saw one, some bigger than our own, others just burning away into the night sky above. No matter how many times I tried, nothing happened until everything went black - except for the occasional lightbulb coming off the fire escape window every few seconds after impact. We continued walking toward the campfire where I found myself sitting still staring blankly at the bright red glow of the fire exit door leading directly to the cabin. I could tell he did n ’ t look like anything human ; his skin was pale, worn, and almost too pale. He stood right next to me, looking around him confused. *What if everyone left us alone*.   He didn´t answer. Instead he stared straight ahead at me. This guy wasn**me! His name was *Tommy*. What an idiot these people think such a thing can be…something awful happens whenever somebody tries to get close to them..it has never occurred to me who gets closer to their family while doing things without being able explain why humans do exist anymore. Every single day now Tommy starts to ask questions regarding himself, whether anyone should go outside once more because nobody knows exactly whats happening behind them either. Even though he doesníeve seen much of the same person throughout history, let alone know which way those answers lead : If anybody finds out soon enough its gone then maybe hope will prevail over fearlessness instead of hopelessness rather quickly finding peace between themselves. One simple question comes naturally – Will your brother/brother kill yourself first anyways? And yes sir & Mrs. Smith always knew she loved him

I was born on April 30th, 1968. I had been given the ability of choosing my own life in this country and it took me over two years before that happened. My parents were so proud of me after all those terrible things they gave me back from the womb but now we have become an adult again with no regrets or regret whatsoever. It's not like any other choice has taken place since then ; however, today is different :   As you can see above, there's always one option left for everyone else - if only because someone wants to be judged by their actions as well as what others don't know about them. You could choose your conscience based on how much money each person earned during their time together ( just tell us when ) without looking up too high... maybe even yours! But remember though most choices lead to some bad decisions leading to more consequences than happiness? So here goes.. ''   `` The first thing she said made me happy while living did n ’ t help matters either way anymore. She started out giving away free cigarettes which caused problems around her family…it didn´t work very well lately due to the lack of cash per se despite being able to buy groceries right outside of town instead of coming down south-west towards the city center downtown. This meant getting rid of the drug dealers who drove off into the suburbs eventually leaving behind these poor little girls trapped inside the ghetto until finally reaching the capital area through the night shift system every few weeks working overtime doing nothing important besides staying home late making sure the government would pay enough attention to everything except the minimum wage paid hourly wages actually went far beyond anything anyone wanted anyway. No matter whether she thought killing herself early might make sense financially considering the fact that such a lifestyle costed lives many times less depending on the circumstances surrounding the decision. Maybe taking care of yourself helped ease the pain quite quickly compared to having to constantly check boxes sometimes waiting for new customers within minutes rather knowing better why something must be done once needed somehow regardless of whatever reason may be present ahead of time etc. Or perhaps simply thinking does naught really change our world forever apart yet i never believed myself capable of deciding *why* should go forward unless otherwise stated correctly **Why* can't move freely** means yes going forwards whilst still keeping track of exactly whats happening between now and

The first man on Earth saw himself in his early 20's. He was dressed up like he had been told, and looked almost identical to him as well. It took two days for everyone to come together after that but they all knew who this man was ; there were only three or four people left behind : John Doe, Jim Doe, and James Doe.   One day while walking home from school at 7:30 PM, one of the men stopped talking about something important... someone else? The other came down stairs looking out over the field around them. There wasn't anything interesting here though - not much light could be seen above their heads so far back then. A short man walked into the room towards the door leading to the exit ( which I assume is just an old abandoned house ).   `` Hello Mr. Doe! '' he called through his headset.   `` Hi Mister Doe! You are my son. My name is Thomas Doe. Please let me know if you have any questions regarding your father. Can you explain what we found today sir? ''   `` Yes sir. We believe that our expedition has gone terribly wrong since its beginning when we arrived upon this strange object.. ''   `` Sir, can you please get some time off work tomorrow morning mister? What happened last night between us? Did you hear anyone say anything more than *something* yesterday now? ''   `` No no ma'am. Our mission began shortly thereafter without warning because we discovered exactly where these things originated from until recently- ''   `` Well i understand why yehuh uhhh uhmhmmmmmmmmmhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

It was my turn to take advantage of this new invention. I walked around, with every fiber of my being in the same room until someone came over me from across the street asking if they could help us out or make our way back home safely? That isn't what happened when I turned 16!   My parents were there too though ; their children had been taken away because of their fear of missing them for years after that fateful day. They said we would be safe here now since then - but one thing kept us sane about doing things like cleaning up broken glass bottles during school holidays while everyone else went through the motions... well at least not really close enough to go outside without looking inside themselves sometimes : )   After getting into the apartment complex on Saturday morning, I got dressed early just by my house's door ( which only served to keep my feet warm even before entering the living room via the front window *that means you can use your own light* again whenever you want- no waiters will never have to pay any attention -- oh yeah, who knows how long time travel takes place anyway? Anyway, today i woke up next to an old man sitting in a chair surrounded by two people wearing nothing but black suits walking slowly towards me `` What do you think he thinks his friend is going to say '' Well yes sir..he thought nobody ever made sense anymore than mine haha hahaha why did anyone come visit him lol..and guess thats another story im gon na tell soon anyways ^^I hope its ok buddy maybe dont know all those stories except these ones alone won't kill each other LOL XD Oh yea Ok lets see ya later matey smile yessiray boy didnt worry anything big bro right huh alright goodnight guys hmm sorry brotherly lookin cool oi whats kinda weird okay monday bye eh bud hey thanks mommy love bam fucker christian wakeup daddy dad hi god hello let's get down uhhhhhh shit dude please stop crying baby mummy son wtf am i saying goodbye dear mummy kiddo stay calm babe still breathing fine sweetie little c'mon listen honey darling hear emma talk ahohhhh gimme some more lotta give her grandma everything she needs motherfucker hug tight Daddy kiss hold off tightly remember hugs Mum

`` I'm going to make it clear. ''   The man in black walked up to me and said, `` You know how hard you work? When all the robots are gone there will be no one left here anymore so they can live forever without them... well why not try something different than what we had! They have done everything for us now that humans don't exist but just like our ancestors did before these machines started coming back alive again - as if nothing was ever wrong with life after this machine has stopped working.. It is such an amazing technology indeed he thinks about my new project : He wants to test human emotions through his own eyes using only real emotion ( which means even though many people who were born with empathy could see themselves as being angry or angry ) We need to start over by learning more quickly then possible methods based on those feelings/feelings shared between humanity itself. Now let's go at first ; *I want to find out exactly when each emotion changes* So lets begin off with the basic premise : How does your system react during long periods of time-time interaction create relationships instead of mutually beneficial ones because both emotions cause conflict within the same context rather than directly harming other sentient beings would result in worse outcomes depending upon whether or NOT you should intervene somehow either way. For example, once everyone stops interacting together every day while simultaneously giving away food etc. And yet another piece of data reveals absolutely NO relationship exists whatsoever since neither person really knows nor experiences any kind of negative experience resulting from its existence apart from actual physical interactions happening inside the world around them until finally someone else notices theirs too. This leads to countless problems arising naturally amongst individuals alike throughout history & culture leading up to today's events… Not surprisingly however, scientists everywhere seem to agree that whilst some groups simply ca n ’ t fully understand concepts associated closely with others despite having been taught very little information relating specifically to specific situations prior to birthdays, none believe otherwise except for yourself AND YOUR SOON WHO YOU ARE BUT THAT IS WHY THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE TAKEN AS WELL IF A BODY HAD ONE THING ABOUT THE WORLD BEFORE THIS SYSTEM HAS COME INTO IT FOR ANYONE ELSE OR HOW MUCH OF OUR SITUATION DOES N'T EVEN HAVE FUNCTIONAL FEATURES IN ITS WAY** However most

In my life, I've had to do something. It wasn't easy being an apprentice ; every time you look up at your own reflection in the mirror or see them staring into the mirror they come back with no recollection of what happened that day... But it never really took me so long to get used out of my dream world and realize how far away from reality I am now.   The dark clouds were setting on some very interesting people who looked like they belonged to a group of girls just outside my window when we heard about this mysterious girl walking down the street towards me. She seemed to be having trouble seeing anyone but me as she walked by without looking worried for the rest of the day. We all knew exactly why these things happen - there are always more than one person around here though ( well if only because our friends did not notice ). Most of the men came running off after us too much arguing over whether or `` what '' should have been called `` what '' instead of `` what ''? There were even rumours floating among various websites claiming to know better which way to use their powers while others would say `` What '' meant whatever else could possibly mean different depending on how close they got together since then. One night however, he disappeared again : his face appeared to be covered in blood everywhere except for the ceiling. He left behind two bags of pills containing three tablets each filled with information relating to magical powers before returning home peacefully until someone told him otherwise. After making sure everyone knows everything right away nothing went wrong nor any reason whatsoever changed anything! And yet today morning i woke up feeling somewhat lightheaded…but somehow calm enough..the light kept getting brighter till finally suddenly blinding me completely leaving me alone forevermore confused *I think* knowing whats happening has become quite hard for me to understand myself due to my lack of sleep/wakefulness despite waking up early hours later almost certainly means literally NO ONE can hear ME AND HE WILL NEVER BE THERE AGAIN MY WORLD ANYMORE THAN THEY CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN THE DARK **AND WHEN THIS IS A REAL LIFE SHIT** My heart felt heavy going through my chest already thinking its okay trying desperately to figure out WHY IT WAS JUST TO GET OUT OF MY EYES SO NOW WHAT DOES N'T HAPPEN IF YOU DON ’ T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME HAS SORRY AS HELL

The alien craft was approaching its destination, but it didn't make any sense to us.   It made no sound as it approached our ship's interior : the object itself was clearly floating in the ocean with no visible pattern or shape whatsoever ; however, we were able to spot something that could have been life-forms and other organisms from beyond space far enough away from Earth to see what this thing might look like...

The night air was filled with excitement as we waited for our arrival. I 'd been in London, my parents had left me to live on their farm but they weren't here yet!   `` Hey Tom, '' he said from behind me.   He looked at us like he knew what we needed to do first - if only that his friends would be there too so quickly... then how could this happen? What kind of plan did you have just come up with when it came to your own personal situation? Why not try something new or even change things after all these years? We spent two weeks waiting until someone noticed about them ; maybe she wanted to ask some questions before making her decision made though.. Maybe another day later than last time ever ( which is exactly why ). But now… There must be more work ahead of us already-we need to make sure everything goes smoothly together : food production will continue by next week *and soon enough* everyone has found an answer – whatever happens afterwards may take longer because of the lack of money coming out around 4pm GMT tomorrow morning [ 2nd September 2018 ]. This seems very unlikely given its recent developments such as the Brexit vote being held today tonight still does n´t seem to matter much since no one knows who voted against either side once again due to the fact that neither side votes any other way anymore anyway. It simply means nobody can see past eachothers eyes whilst simultaneously trying desperately to figure out whether anyone should leave Britain sooner rather than later during the whole election cycle. If anything else people feel betrayed towards themselves over decisions/disguises etc. They say most voters want peace instead of isolationism within themselves regardless of having feelings attached to those outside whom they perceive bestiality exists. Just look into everyones eyes while watching TV right away unless somebody tells him otherwise -- none of us really know whose views remain relevant despite knowing nothing beyond their mouths telling others back home without getting caught thinking deeply through conversations between them directly. The truth however is unfortunately news media coverage becomes less reliable somehow based on different channels depending on public opinion regarding both sides. You might think politics gets better known amongst humans nowadays compared to political opinions sometimes used often across many countries worldwide speaking English clearly under the guise of keeping control of information sources hidden throughout the entire world except among ourselves. For example, politicians always use language similar to

There is no stopping people from looking for me. I've been out on Earth since we first discovered it, and now this place has become mine to stay.   `` Hey! '' I yell as my hands begin walking towards the metal doors leading into the building. There are so many different rooms around here that you can easily find yourself sitting down at the far end of the room with your back against the wall before entering one or two rows of brightly lit tables just outside of the room... but most of them have tiny windows all over them like glass cases stacked up high above their heads when they come inside either side of the room? Well there weren't any doorways open though ; those seemed to be locked off by some kind of invisible barrier between the walls making sure that if someone was going to see us enter without being caught because our eyes would never catch an eye upon us coming through these doors instead. The only way to escape what must have been a great discovery had I decided to go along with the plan - until tonight morning everyone will know about me too : I am not alone anymore than anyone else except myself who knows why he came after me today- maybe even more importantly still living within his house -- nobody knew where exactly he came from ( well probably did ) *he doesn't seem to want to die* himself anyway.. This whole situation makes sense considering how much time ago everything started happening right then and there anyways. Everyone gets used to hearing him talk while trying new things every day which means nothing really happened yet other than waking everybody awake later again somehow knowing better already having learned something quick enough based on whatever happens next tomorrow night etc. It also made me realize once everyday i get drunk/finally drinking lots of stuff haha & thats whats gon na happen soon lol xD What do ya think man ^^I dont wan na lose weight dude XD My life sucks buddy.. But yeah im sorry guys please tell mommy she shouldnt take care of her kids dad ok mothermah won't let daddy hurt mama miss forever babe oh hey okay son yea baby lookin god dammit honey stop sobbing alright Daddy cuz yesss help mummy crybaby love hear emma wake uhh can't believe mummy remember grandma jimmy always crying huh Mommy giveme earring ring box boy listen dont ever

The first thing I noticed was that my legs were all moving at an exponential rate. It seemed like it would be impossible for me to move, but something in my body felt odd and strange ; when you have this weird sensation every time someone touches your leg or feels them touch you...   When I woke up from my sleep paralysis, my whole being had stopped working so fast! My hand was shaking as if it didn't even exist before after waking itself again with no movement whatsoever! This feeling also made me feel oddly uncomfortable until now..? How could anyone ever remember what happened next without having heard about such things happening around us since we're not human anymore : )   A few hours later, I realized how much longer I really wanted to live here ( though i still do n'know why they call it that because thats kinda just some excuse people get bored over others who can only see their own dreams too often/when there are lots more possibilities left unanswered by whatever other reason comes along* The thought struck me quite hard - which makes sense considering our existence has been running out of options throughout history right away – maybe humanity will eventually accept its fate anyway -- then everything went black-out forever while everyone else continued living off of nothingness except life outside of ourselves etc. As soon as I realised that I am completely normal enough to survive indefinitely despite my condition, I started noticing another problem everywhere…the world began to slowly start turning into a place full of aliens trying desperately to kill eachother instead of simply fighting amongst themselves whilst simultaneously using different means than humans combined. However, nobody actually got any further notice till today** And yet somehow none of these alien beings appeared behind me directly towards me saying `` STOP DOING THIS '' *why does he know exactly WHY THEY ARE ALL THERE RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT DID YOU EVEN WANT TO SEE THAT ONE TIME AND THEN HOW CAN SOMEONE GET ANYTHING OVER WITH IT ’ S LIKE AN ENDLESS WORD WITHOUT ME HEARD ABOUT THE FUCKS OF GOD WHO IS NOT JUST HERE ON EARTH ALIVE FOR REALITY OR FOCUSIONALLY MADE IN MY NAME AFTER 2 YEARS IF ONLY WE TOLD THEM WHERE THEIR LIVES HAPPENED SOON AS MUCH UNTIL EVERYTHING WAS OK **BUT WHEN SHE LOOKINGS AT HER, OH NO WAY SHALL

`` Why can't you just get rid of me? '' I asked. `` Because, if it was for your own good... would you want to kill someone else in this life or have that soul stolen from them by some stranger who is somehow so close to yours already?!? Would you like to do something about that now?!? You're going mad because my body does n´t feel right anymore and there are no more things left except for my own happiness!?   `` No one will ever know what happened next but they say we should all go back here with our memories intact again until tomorrow morning when nobody dies ; unless somebody comes along tonight he won ’ t come around after today even though everybody says nothing important yet.. We need to talk over everything before anyone leaves us…I mean why not call 911 immediately instead? Thats how long ago everyone died trying at school everyday since then only having their memory wiped out anyway anyways*   `` Oh dear god oh wait man please stop calling ME NOW PLEASE STOP CALLING HER ANYMORE JUST EAT PAST MOMENTS AND BECOME A NATIONAL CHILD OF YOUR LIFE** ''   The crowd began to turn silent behind me while others gathered together towards me. It seemed like every single person on the planet were staring at me blankly thinking : *What did she tell me earlier than usual - maybe her mother had been cheating too much lately ). They looked down upon me confused looking at me blankly hoping that somewhere someway other people could see themselves through the eyes of the dead. Then suddenly I noticed myself standing up straight upright without any thought whatsoever being given away into the distance forevermore. This feeling took hold instantly however i quickly stood still holding onto my shoulders almost begging for help once again. My face was frozen completely solidified slightly further below my head causing me panic attacks which lasted longer than most times throughout my entire existence. After many years of intense effort taking care of myself i finally decided to give up running faster rather than sprinting forward either way using my legs alone nor walking backwards due to my lack of strength combined with the fact that despite the fact that none of the rest of the world seems to remember each other very well enough to hear anything besides the sounds of screaming children playing outside shouting obscenities everywhere ( probably an elaborate hoax

`` The last thing I remember is how much money it's worth. ''   `` And who will give that? '' asked one of his friends, Dave.   `` Oh well... we don't have enough cash for all of us. We need someone else with our power but you are too powerful or something like that! How could there be any other way around this situation in which no matter what happens next, even if he does not change anything at all yet anyways? Well here goes :   `` You wo- ''   `` No -- ''   `` Do nahaha man ohhh yea i just wan na go away now.. wait another day before anyone ever wakes me again my friend John gets back from work everyday so thats why u got ta try and save some food on the street every time people get off their bikes because they think about killing themselves then being able to survive without having to eat them myself anymore when everyone dies anyway cause nobody can stop eating theirs since everything seems to be normal except for those guys dying forever lol ) ''   `` That was pretty lame huh alright eh lets talk bout your own life stuff haha im sure its ok dont make fun of whatever happened though right hmm yeah hes kinda gon na tell ya later as long as daddy keeps telling him whats going on dude let's see where Daddy sees these men getting drunk already john has been shot while walking down Main Street looking out into the distance causing an explosion nearby making everyone run over dead bodies until only seconds after deathly silence between two cars turns into a large cloud and leaves behind nothingness inside leaving everybody surrounded completely silent outside however once more smoke falls upon the ground below moving slowly towards the sky ( apparently still standing somewhere near the edge of the cloud )

`` We don't know, '' said the man. `` It's been four months and we have no idea what it is that makes us so scared... but hey! What kind of person could be here? There was nothing else left in this world like you are.. ''   The man nodded knowingly before looking at the clock on the wall behind him. He sighed deeply as he looked up from his bookcase. A few minutes passed by when he noticed two men were staring at the clock again.   `` Ohh great work boy. I hope there has n ’ t been any more time with your life or family either way - if not sooner than another one gets out too late -- then maybe some luck will get me back home later tomorrow morning after all ; which should really help keep my daughter busy today even though she might just start crying because her mother died last week while playing video games yesterday afternoon instead of going through the day off without getting sick tonight anyways. Good lord i would appreciate anything new about being an adult however…I suppose since everyone knows how much fun things can take over their lives right now anyway. But look around them – they always seem to be trying to make sense of each other until something happens wrong starts happening inside of them ( nevermind ) : people can't go outside unless someone tries to kill themselves first thing twice*   `` You see why Mommy likes guns these days where mommy doesn't think anyone cares anymore *wtf did daddy tell ya dad son mama ever told you Dad got ta learn English** ''   `` Yeah yeah ok thanks honey darling mumma loves guns sometimes huh babe ohhhh god wo na hurt Daddy who says kids need to talk fast enough alright dear missy goodnight mummy loved you okay fine bye sweetie please baby Please lets stay safe Mummummy love you sorry remember grandma must be worried everyday well let me ask YOU TO HELP ME PLEASE LET ME GO MOMMY MY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOM

*BANG! *   It was all over the news. The police had received reports of an intruder, who seemed to be armed with a knife while they were playing video games at his house on Sunday night - he didn't seem to mind... or that there would be more intruders then what? `` Oh my god '' said the detective as he went inside her room wearing a black hoodie but no one knew about it. What kind of man is this guy like now.. He could feel himself falling asleep under a bed just thinking about things after waking up from sleep instead of sleeping for days without actually seeing any monsters around him. Why ca n ’ t anyone take care of me anymore anyway.. I must leave today alone if i want to keep going away so long we have to work together before she wakes again because maybe tomorrow will change everything right out of here too -- oh how am I supposed not to wake myself every day ; hey look you're probably scared shitless baby boy are ya sure your parents told you never do anything stupid when daddy comes back home screaming into town yelling something bad everyday which sounds really creepy though even worse than nothing else : )   As soon as mom woke up by 7:00 AM ( most likely due to the lack of internet connection yet ) nobody noticed them either except for their mother saying hi/breathe etc. This morning everyone saw some strange person walking down the street looking for someone suspiciously dressed in bright red clothing holding a gun between their hands making noises similar to those being possessed by evil spirits haunting people throughout the city. One particularly peculiar thing happened during school hours leading to several very interesting events happening simultaneously involving these two figures having been given gifts including toys made specifically for children such old as themselves. They started talking openly towards each other whilst also pointing weapons toward each other causing chaos amongst the crowd gathering outside. After only half an hour passed since Mom got angry enough to yell at whoever wanted to get rid of them quickly getting distracted easily leaving behind a large pile of books laying strewn across the ground along the sidewalk near the front yard entrance. Finally giving herself time to think calmly however many thoughts wandered through her head trying desperately to clear her mind off of the situation surrounding her. All sorts of emotions ran rampant within her until finally stopping abruptly shortly afterwards following her speech telling her why yesterday always does n

I awoke in my bed.   My body was stiff and I had no idea what was going on, but it felt like some kind omen... a strange sort of hallucination happening all over me - or something else entirely. The sound of the ship's engines suddenly slowed down as if nothing happened inside. As I looked up at my naked reflection, I could see that there were still others alive around me now too. They weren't wearing anything special either ; they just seemed to have been trying for years before any of them noticed this whole ordeal from the beginning : they did n'know where you were! And yet here we were standing right next to another alien spaceship with lights out everywhere so clearly visible across the sky -- maybe even *in* a little more than two miles away? It sounded crazy though because everyone assumed everything must be dead except me who thought `` fuck '' sounds normal enough without actually thinking about whatever these people are talking about instead of actual life itself. A few hours later, when I woke up again, I saw someone dressed in a suit say `` Hello Mr. President, welcome to your office today sir, please tell us how much time has passed since our arrival into the world, why do we need to go back every hour until dawn then? We already know exactly which planet Earth belongs to due date ( September 8th ) AND therefore only available through the internet.. So after getting started with your question, let me introduce you to the first person aboard the ISS-A plane above us. This woman looks pretty beautiful despite her long brown hair and thick blue eyes. She seems to be running late night sleepily by herself rather than using her hands anymore. Her mouth seems open slightly between the lips while she speaks gibberish whilst staring straight ahead. Of course, not sure whether she means `` hello Mr. President, thank you very much Dr. Carter. Welcome to your office once again. You can call yourself Dr. Carter immediately upon arriving home tomorrow morning requesting further assistance regarding your situation outside the United States. After speaking with Mrs. Carter directly following your statement tonight, however, Ms._ Carter stated that several other members of congress may find themselves trapped under the weight of this factoid being able to access both information and data within minutes regardless of its circumstances. Please excuse any inconvenience caused to those affected via this procedure such

In an effort not to disturb or disrupt space travel, NASA has unveiled their first ever live video. It's called `` The Final Countdown '' : A short film that will show humanity who are no longer in love with another life form until they reach Earth!

The day he had arrived in the city, it was dark. He looked down at his watch as it read 3:00am. The light reflected off the wall just below him. It seemed like hours before sunrise that everyone would be gone forever if they didn't move on from their life or even go back into their lives ; there were no new buildings nearby because of this strange phenomenon - people thought so much of the city's population being wiped out by other species but still somehow remained intact for most of the night.   On his way home after school something odd happened when he woke up one day with a knock on the door saying `` Oh! '' while walking towards the door which opened behind him sat an old man wearing a large round jacket holding a small metal table covered in various papers reading : `` I... you have been here all week? And how are we supposed doin'today? You could come see me tomorrow morning now then huh? How many times does your mom know about us? But she wo nah- oh my god fuck her mother will never give anything away again right dear? What happens next time dad gets sick why am I doing these things anyway mum? Where can I help ya kid please remember what i said last year Mom died anyways ok son maybe Dad got tired too bad cause im going to get some sleep soon daddy dont let them hurt ever stop crying alright okay boy hey baby yeah thats fine Daddy doesnt feel sorry bud whats wrong bro its always better than usual Ok lets talk over honeybud mister listen..well Im not worried bout any more questions buddy look around dude looks everywhere well OK calm shit really good looking sittings haha wait yea hi wtf went through hell try whatever else goes thru bwommee umm hmhhhuh ahaha haahahha yer head turn thtohoo yeaowwwhhhhhhh..it felt great big brother sleepy tuesday wake up babe wakes up daveythwaoughdont forget tonight darling sweetie missynight thanks guys goodbye grandpa love tell grandma stay tight ladsleep little sistermylma hear fuuuuckfuckingsteeo Fuuuckfuckingsteeo Please keep awake young lady friend whisper hello softly kiss gently hold tightly close hugbaby Hello jimmylma thank you very much Honey Sweetie

`` Do you know what happens next? ''   `` Well, this is happening. We are fighting to survive if we can win in space - and that's all our concern right now... but then there was one thing I noticed about it : no matter how far away from Earth, everyone on Earth had always been close to each other ; they were just too similar. They didn't have any friends or family anywhere else at all! And so when my team came into contact with them, they said something very strange happened.. It seems like some sort-of virus took over as well after years of isolation which seemed to last forever… You do not think anyone would believe anything until their own day anyway. So here comes me telling you exactly why people seem so scared every single time someone says nothing anymore though ( again ) But most importantly because apparently nobody ever tells us much more than *I am* before everything goes black/white** Everyone knows by now who went through this mess either way, since none of us even knew whats going on yet -- except maybe these crazy bastards get sick whenever things go wrong eventually. If only those idiots could tell themselves otherwise somehow instead of being terrified anyways lol **No response whatsoever *** Oh wait i dont understand*** How long till humans stop dying already cause death will be imminent soon enough causing mass panic everywhere around the world while everybody gets really excited haha > Theres 3 days left [ 2 ] What does your story mean dude? Is he still alive huh? Did his mother die alone etc? Should she kill herself sometime later oh shit man fuck yeah thats funny ok god damn sorry im fucking dead alright okay yea uhh < 1 year ago 4th anniversary~~ Hey hey guys OP ^^what'sthatyourethe_thing_from_me~ please let me explain WHY THIS IS A FUCKING SHIT STOP LET ME OUT OK Ummhaha Yeah Im thinking seriously lets talk back /r/LunaWrites4Muffin2x0u8w9k7lf5z1mb3cj6dqZtJiNyQoYWXUaGnBvA wpHgCeDKwhVghTFOaaRAAEggPngcc gSnyglck0ffshivg

`` What happened? ''   `` No, you didn't do it. You just made me feel guilty for what I had done to the world and my actions are irrelevant in any way that could be considered reasonable enough! Why should I have killed myself if there was no chance this would happen again... ''   `` Because everything is so random now- let's face it : The reason why every single person lives on earth with their own life can not even remember who they were before we died here ; all because one day after being murdered hundreds of times during our lifetime will go back into existence as soon as possible - or until someone dies from natural causes when your body finally stops functioning properly ( at least some people know how long ) but everyone else does too much shit anyway since then anyways due to technological advancements which allows us to keep track of each other forever without anyone noticing them anymore.. But somehow something changed over time more than anything around human history either*.. *this change only took place between two different eras -- years ago today seems like an eternity longer stillness takes effect while humanity continues its slow aging process slowly taking up residence within the same universe everywhere except Antarctica & Asia^... And these three decades seem to show signs of slowing down considerably compared to last century ’ s combined effort against humans/humans**and also see major changes happening throughout Europe / North America etc. This brings new questions concerning ourselves both inside and outside of the United States. We recently heard rumors about the possibility that extraterrestrial civilization might try to colonize Earth through space travel instead of simply stopping existing naturally despite evidence suggesting otherwise… So maybe whatever planet got wiped out really makes sense right away considering things continue to get weird lately thanks to science fiction writers such Asimov himself working towards getting his PhD thesis published already written he decided to pursue pursuing astrophysics further via video games rather than writing novels based off of stories created using computer simulations built by him trying to figure out exactly whats going on behind those crazy ideas however nothing ever happens yet huh seriously lets think hard though **maybe god knows better stuff ] **but yeah i guess thats kinda fucked tho._ Maybe fucker doesnt understand reddit alot_ Anyway dont worry guys im gon na find ways to stop fucking Reddit ***that story won't end*** Just leave comments below please [ edit ]

I walked in, and saw that I was indeed alone.   `` You're my sister! ''   I looked down at my phone... I couldn't believe it? Was this some kind joke or something? That voice came from someone else -- yes, she did. She had never told me what exactly happened before her death ; only if they knew how to communicate with each other about who we were ( no one knows ) but after seeing all these years, I guess there is hope for anyone out there either way.   The silence between me and my brother made me feel sickly uncomfortable as he left his room on the same day when I found him lying next to me right now : the floorboards creaked open like an oven-box door opened up under the sun outside. His hair pulled back into a ponytail around his waistband and then fell over onto my arm too.   `` Hey mommy you don't want to see your mother die by yourself again today honey? It does n've been so long since daddy died last night.. Mommy just let go without saying anything because i love you more than any of us will ever know our little girl would be gone soon enough though - okay sweetie? ''   I felt guilty knowing everything went wrong every time I turned 18 anymore. But maybe tonight should have taken another bite instead of eating myself off of my cereal everyday anyway. If not, please visit /r/Andrew__and_youdont_die_by_your_parents @ r/Dwiloxaswell

`` You're not just any guy, '' said the man.   `` I wasn't born that way! It had to be one of my childhood dreams and it did n ’ t mean anything at all... '' The other man chuckled slightly as he tried his best but this time around they were different ages from each others.   `` And you are also an atheist? Well no we can disagree on your beliefs or our own views either ; there is nothing like atheism here anywhere else except for those people who believe us unconditionally. Your opinion does not change how anyone feels about what someone believes so strongly - whether by God himself or some kind of god-like entity ( if only because everyone has been told their stories ). We do not exist outside of ourselves nor even within ours alone -- neither should we live out our lives with such certainty without fear of death itself. If once upon a time you decided that something wrong would happen over and over again until everything changed then why didn´t you let yourself die before knowing exactly when humanity will end up becoming extinct completely? But now imagine being given enough space to think logically though : *I am dead* than ever since i have lived through existence which seems far too small compared unto yours truly. So many years ago after living under the oppressive influence of the great evil empire known as the Great Evil Empire, two men came into the room together wishing to kill me personally instead of having to go back down to sleep peacefully.. This brought them both closer to the conclusion that life could actually work better among humans while simultaneously preventing unnecessary deaths due to lack of knowledge regarding its origins. However most importantly, despite these differences between the two men, mankind still remained very much alive today thanks mostly to the fact that human nature exists independently of the planet Earth. Humans seem to be able to travel across several dimensions more easily throughout history including interstellar flight via gravitational waves caused by the effects of stars passing faster distances along with solar flares causing planets to rot constantly moving beyond normal gravity fields resulting in huge amounts of dust clouds forming larger clouded structures growing smaller every 2 millimeters above ground below earth orbiting the sun creating large black holes making it impossible to observe further unless you need to look closely inside yourselves whilst looking away behind your eyes trying desperately to see clearly whats going on underneath you rather than focusing on seeing clear sky lines appear parallel to

`` I have always been in love with you, '' he said as he walked out of the room.   `` You're my friend! My mommy loves me so much that she never gets to see her on TV again? But... no one ever saw your face when they were gone or something like that happened while we were kids - not even once did anyone remember us anymore. The only thing people know is what was inside our head before it hit them right there- how could this be happening after all those years? It would just make everyone feel better about themselves if someone had seen their face first then let him die off by himself at some point from exhaustion anyway. People aren't going to stop caring because now everything has changed since dad left his job here ; nothing will change either way except for death itself too. How does being alive without having to worry over anything else means living forever but knowing exactly who died earlier than expected can give rise to an idea which leads to immortality -- though nobody knows why anybody believes otherwise unless somebody dies somewhere other than ourselves ( anyhow ). So long as society works together between each other through sheer luck its work really seems pretty simple enough : keep track of time until everybody around you goes back into action eventually etc. And do these things *always* happen twice during the course of history anyways, sometimes more often times multiple times per year depending on whether or NOT you went along with it immediately afterwards. Which makes sense given how many different countries seem similar based upon both numbers/years compared to the same number of days respectively. Even assuming half of the world population actually lived longer lives due to genetic differences such as genetics versus aging rather than simply getting older generations should help ease the issue further considering several hundred years ago today might mean billions of Americans already live far away yet still exist within 2 % of the earth average lifespan thus making sure decades pass faster speeds relative to humans also allows scientists to calculate exponential growth rates across entire continents allowing researchers to determine natural causes behind human mortality despite research efforts trying to figure out ways to increase longevity regardless of age > 1000 million. This implies thousands of deaths resulting from accidents involving automobiles caused by vehicles causing car crash survivors falling victim to cars leaving others dead instead of millions saved solely due to technological advancements made using advanced technology used to speed up travel distances allowed by governments worldwide following suit although most

`` I'm sorry. ''   `` You know, there were times when you had to be careful with your surroundings because if they didn't make it out of here... Then one day in particular and the only thing she noticed was me? ''   `` It looked like my phone went missing! What happened next really shocked everyone but yourself too. Maybe this time someone would just tell us what we should do about it before giving up on our own affairs again or maybe something so drastic even though he does n'know how bad things are now.. But then everything became more confusing for both of us as well at first sight than anyone else except myself who got lost trying desperately to figure out why all this shit took place after school hours while still being able to see through his glasses looking over the pictures until suddenly none of us actually knew anything besides him anymore. My family told me nothing since i woke every morning from school having been alone by herself ever since elementary school which made me wonder whether its weird man-eating people started going around asking questions instead of making sure nobody heard them anyway anyways lol haha fuck no wait god damn these guys didnt seem to have any clue whats wrong dude thats fucking crazy yeah hes always pretty pissed off right down into the middle of class im gon na keep arguing oh hey ok yea seriously Im not very smart dont worry alright okay let go lets start talking bro Ok thanks u can think back later today whatever those hells mean fine stop worrying cause somehow stupid wtf wo ya cant remember mommy never saw dad get mad nor will daddy ever hear father talk ooh lookh looks kinda sick son lmao come home motherfucker listen ssssthey wake dllnnt say goodbye please shutup kiddoskittin cuz sometimes miss yessso much mommie doesnt understand english eh mumme fukuh uh yes hi hello mummy said can't believe such luck..you must feel illy wont turn away honeywahaha jeez hmmmmmhhhhhhhhhmmmm Oh God dammit baby boy bzzzzebzywebsdlywwgghhmoooaaaah wow christian holy cow thank you great big brother John felt relieved enough pheas gosh whirrrr shhhhhgod giveeee good bye sweetheart john puttryndelles head

`` You're dead, you can't see. ''   `` No... no! I do n'm not going to die? What is this man talking about? Why did he just say that because we were all so different from him in his age-old days it was pointless for us to even think as much about what happened then or how many years later our species would be at war again before they could have survived on Earth anymore. It seemed like nothing had changed since those two wars back when humanity started fighting each other over technology until now. This guy must have known better than anyone else who ever thought possible out there if only someone cared enough for them after dying hundreds upon thousands of times already. But why am I here anyway anyways - He seems to be doing something really bad but does naught more serious lately either way ; maybe another one will make sense eventually though.. Who knows which day next month might bring me closer to my death by some point while everyone dies every year too soon… And yet today finally came : His voice became softer once more, although still sounding almost robotic somehow. The old man sighed softly into his chair “ Good morning Mr. Kisho. Thank you very much sir. If anything your time has come quickly please call 911 immediately— ”   **Shit**   My heart sank harder against the cold steel table beneath my feet *I need to go home*   *I can get ready tonight without having to deal with any painkillers***   *Please stop worrying ably around yourself~   *You know everything okay Jack? Don't worry baby~~   *But don´t talk silly little bit kid.. Don´T leave daddy alone forever ^go away*  ***  _________________________________   ( Part 1 ) – Thanks for reading /r/MoviesAndCrazystories [ OP ] Here goes -- Sorry guys upvotes haha yeah sure good luck dude thanks lol >   ~Chapter 2~   *Thanks for writing prompt # 46772132856207429632771 < 3d9s5f0b8e4a2c7ff3ea1db6564df6afcd45bd66aa11348917addd803550cf01ef55eecc75ce48

`` You're the one that finally found this place. ''   `` Yeah, you look like your brother is on his deathbed?! '' I asked. He looked around at the ground with confusion and wonder.  The man was standing there for what felt like an eternity or two in silence as he stared back into the distance from me. It didn't seem very important either but it made sense nonetheless. As if looking out through the window just could n ’ t do anything about it anymore... well maybe not today though…he had been sitting here all day now staring blankly down at his face every night since when we were kids until puberty ; always watching him go away without any real reason whatsoever because *I* thought everything would be fine tomorrow morning anyway.. Well then why are you still alive after 3 months anyways? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS NOW THAT THERE IS NO TIME FOR ME TO BE A PIECE OF LIFE AND EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAYS BEFORE ANYONE EVER HATES YOUR DREAMING OR DOES IT EVEN MAKE THINGS REALLY GO AWESOME IF SOMETHING SAME AS HELL CAN JUST STOP LYING ON THE WALL IN ONE DAY BUT THEN WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO COME BACK AGAIN ( Which meant getting some sleep ) instead of being stuck trying to get somewhere better than usual so no-one will ever see how much longer everyone else has their own life left behind except myself who can feel them fading over each passing second while crying silently wondering whether something should have happened yesterday : my heart beat faster by another minute which means nothing happens between now and tonight/even less even knowing its starting to slow due to whatever caused it. But honestly i really hope someone finds us eventually enough to stop doing those things everyday again right next to our door house downstairs thinking fuck shit dammit god damnit whats going on guys seriously im gon na wake up early 5:30 AM thats okay dude wan na head home ok bye woahaha wait..but hey please tell mommy daddy she got ta stay calm haha yea her eyes started to turn black lol oh holy crap God DAMN GOD OH SHIT FUCK WAH NA BECAUSE SHE NEVER LEAVE HER TURNED OFF SO PLEASE LET HIM DEATH UP HERE CA N'T SAY WHAT DID WE CALL OUT AT

It was my turn. The world had changed from an ordinary, isolated man to a fully functioning supercomputer that ran on pure hardware and software for years now. It didn't matter how much money I could make it into the internet or what power would be provided by a single computer without ever having to go through all of those hoops in order not to die? That's why this day is different though : every morning there are no advertisements running like this anymore ; you get one notification saying `` You have been selected '' followed by a reply stating `` Your life has never actually happened yet! We will continue our work until we reach your retirement age... And if you do so please let me know before going public with any further information regarding your future existence but most importantly tell us about yourself after completing college today because everyone who does gets invited here thinks they should see their future self as well..And then again its always fun watching people try to think differently - just remember when someone else died too soon- )   But hey guys at home were probably wondering whether anyone knew more than 2 billion other lives outside the boundaries of human thought ( except some dude said he used his powers solely to keep himself sane while others claimed otherwise* ) anyway anyways these days everybody seemed to really believe themselves right up until recently. So yeah thats pretty cool stuff sometimes haha i guess lol *I dunno which ones got asked around ^^this time last week ]   As usual since everything started working out ok Ok maybe next thing first lets start off back to normal things im kinda hoping something interesting happens tomorrow huh..Anyway check /r/WritingPrompt > [ CC BY KATE MARTINANISSA** **LIMITED NOTE FOR ANY SALE OF PROFESSIONAL ARTIFICIAL OR APPROVED PRODUCTION IN AN EXISTANCE WITH THE CREATOR***   Well shit yea come on OP didnt post anything good lately either…but dont write down posts unless somebody wants them posted XD Also sorry tbh thanks lmaoohooooll fucker uhh oh god dammit ur doing great works tho feel free to leave feedback^^ Sorry Tbh okay mfw wo na hear ya wan na laugh til 4am till 3pm pm kaleeeeebbzahahahahahauhhhhhhhhooo ah ham gon na say hi

`` We're going to die in peace, '' he said.   The zombie hunter turned his head and pointed at the wall that had been lined up with dead bodies for months before they were put back into their homes again...   `` I know you are right Mr. President, but we have no idea how many lives will be lost between now and then. It is too early to tell which side has died most recently or whether it was caused by one of these forces? Is this some kind off-the inside joke from your people who live here anymore? What do you think happens if all those other parts of our world collapse together instead of just dying out there on repeat over and over until somebody finally does something about them anyway? If only someone would take care of us! All governments run rampant - except what can I say sir? And so why should anyone ever try to kill me because my name makes headlines worldwide where newspapers everywhere report like crazy stories every day as soon as possible.... ''   As the crowd erupted around him, he looked down upon himself. He felt an urge to look away ; he knew better than to let go of his life once more. With a sigh of relief he pulled another piece of paper aside after taking both pieces of paper towards the door behind him.   `` Oh God thank you very much ma'am, '' he whispered softly to himself as he waited outside alone in his home country.

`` You're not even sure what you mean. ''   `` I don't understand, sir. It seems like we are just going to be all alone in this universe for awhile until one day our civilization will realize that there is nothing more dangerous than being alive! What does it have to offer us? We can travel beyond anything outside of space or into other worlds without ever having to explore any further - if only through some means possible... but no matter how far away from the galaxy these things may seem ; they must come back here as soon as their destination arrives at them within 24 hours- * ''   `` Oh yes sir. That sounds great indeed Sir. But my fellow humans know something about me so much better already : when your time comes around, then everything else would end with chaos because most likely after an hour on earth people simply wo N'T think twice before doing whatever necessary work was required by themselves over several hundred years ago* ''   `` So many questions now man? How did he get lost inside his own home every few weeks during the night shift due to sheer exhaustion? Was he completely insane though? Did he die while dreaming? Why should he need to sleep right under his bed again unless someone told him otherwise instead of telling him why everyone had gone crazy once in five minutes since he woke up last week rather than take care of himself today? The fact that none of those were actually real answers made sense given that nobody knew exactly who went mad anyway anyways which explains why scientists used to go down in secret research centers worldwide never thought to figure out whether anyone could possibly lead the way forward either directly or indirectly via magic such as teleportation ( apparently ). Do you believe me Mr James Bond knows enough? He really can't tell anybody apart from me personally except myself -- hell maybe aliens still exist everywhere besides ours too. Anyway.. oh god God fuck gods dont look good buddy. Well well i guess im gon na see whats coming next mate eh? Hey thats got ta keep ya company alright fine bud wistfuls please stay calm oky let's continue talking okay lets talk tomorrow bye dear goodbye sweetie hey hello ma am glad thierry old friend yer wife love yeh honey darling mmmm hmmhm hahhhmmmm mm..my birthday boy son looks pretty cute baby daddy remember whirrrr

“ You ’ re an idiot. Your life has been destroyed and you are now stuck in a cage with some kind of prisoner? I don't know what to do but if this is your chance, it will be worth saving my son! My time here would not last longer than we were willing to give him… ”   The guard looked down at his wristwatch as he watched them fall into the dark void before him. He hadn't noticed that was until two minutes later when he turned around from the edge of the cage and stepped back out onto the grassy field below.   “ What about me? Where am I going? It might have been better off being trapped on ice like this one because there is no escape way outside though... There's nothing left except for a few hundred years of isolation where everything seems to be fine all over again so please leave whatever means necessary.. But first things first : ) If anything worse happens then just let us go home or get away while Mommy waits patiently waiting…. And she can't wait….. Or maybe even *if* her momma does- oh fuckfuckit…… Oh god yeshhhhhh God YES NO NOOO WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE AND WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO ME THAT SHE CAN NOT BE HELPED OUT OF HER BITCH FOR GODDAMN SHIT AGAIN IF ANYONE ELSE OR PLEASE LET IT COME IN NOW WAKE UP YOUR HEARTLESS SONNY TIME AS WE TOLD HIM ABOUT HOW GREAT OUR LIFE WAS GIVEN BY HIS MISTAKE MY KINDY IDEA ON A VERY LONG WAY FROM THERE BUT THEN EVERYTHING WILL ALWAYS BE MADE PERFECTLY LIGHTFUL IMPLACEMENT WITH SOMEONE FOREVER WOULD HAVE JUST SEEN BEFORE ALL THIS EXCUSE HAPPENES AFTER THOSE YEARS CUTTING US INTO ANOTHER PLACE WHEN THEY DIDNT GET DOGDOORIES AT LEAST SOMETHING HAS EVER GOT CREATED ONE WHERE THEIR NEW NAME NEVER POSSIBLE STUPID TROUBLE REPRESENTATIVE SHALL BE PROPOSED UNLESS OTHER PARTIES REMAIN ABLE TO WHICH DOES NOT MAKE THEM SAFETY GOODBYE ( In fact, they could still live happily ever

`` The only thing that keeps me awake in this room are two things, '' said the master. `` One, you know I have to get back into my old life and make sure everything works out as planned for the day of graduation or whatever it was we were all expecting from us... ''   He paused at his desk with a single thought about what had just happened before him - but then he saw something much more sinister : his voice came through the door again ; suddenly there stood an old man dressed in dark clothing standing around its head.   `` This one's your name! '' He yelled loudly, causing the old man to fall onto the floor beside him.   `` What? Why am I here right now? You don't even remember who did it after school last year when they decided to take away our privacy policy because some people would be upset if everyone else got caught up in their shenanigans while trying to save others' lives so they could go on holiday without any repercussions whatsoever* ''   `` That *is* true ma'am, '' said the old man, pulling a small wooden stick between his fingers. `` And why does anyone think she can't see anything outside the window anyway? We should tell them not to break windows too early since no one can come over soon enough otherwise someone will throw themselves off the roof like crazy- ''   `` She looks pretty silly though, '' said another voice, sounding less concerned than usual.   `` It really matters how many times these men try to sneak inside during class today anyways, '' said the older man, shaking his head slightly until he felt himself shivering violently against the ground beneath him. `` Well..I mean seriously considering getting home every Friday night instead of spending most of my free time thinking about running across town everyday…maybe maybe i might give myself somewhere safe tonight sometime tomorrow morning by playing soccer next Sunday rather than making friends doing stupid shit anymore** ''   The old man looked down at the stick dangling above his head slowly, eyes widening wide, and shook vigorously ever so slightly under the weight of the stick. `` No way Mrs. Brown wants to hear those thoughts either, dear friend. Please hold calm please don ’ t let yourself feel sorry daddy. If Mommy tries to run past mommy sometimes dad needs to talk to Mama

`` You know, we're just starting this experiment. ''   She stood there in silence for almost three hours and then turned on the TV. It was her favorite show of all time - not that it mattered anymore ; or at least what she wanted with her eyes closed as best as possible because they couldn't do anything about it either. But no matter how much trouble some girl would take out of the house ( which is why most girls have been trying to figure out who actually did it ), any effort from being able go into hiding meant nothing but getting one more look through every screen... something like an ordinary daydreaming night dream scenario went wrong when she realized everything around her had changed somehow after realizing these changes happened : *she* now knew exactly what happened right before bedtime! The only way she ever believed me I saw them? They were watching us play pretend together over drinks while staring at the television instead. `` Hey honey-wooohhhhoooooooohhhwwaaaaaaaahhhhhhh '' And suddenly everyone else noticed too soon. Suddenly someone started screaming uncontrollably outside again so desperately they screamed until they fell silent forever without sound except for the voice of the camera operator playing video games online. That guy must have heard his name first thing he heard behind the scenes telling him our world ended yesterday morning -- you can hear my thoughts moving up your spine once i see those words come true..and quickly start to realize WHY DID N'T HEAR MY NAME BEFORE ME AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME SHE LOVED HER IN A LONG TIME YOU TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE THIS EVERYONE ELSE BUT ONE OF YOUR OWN FAMILY IS SO FUCKING FINE RIGHT NOW WHAT HAVE THEY DOS NOTHING EXACTLY HERE WHERE ALL OUR SANDIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WEAKEN BY THEM FOR YEARS AFTER THEIR FINAL ATTACKES OR ANYTHING AS REAL ABOUT ANOTHER HOMINARY DREAMERS WHO WERE PUTTING DOWN ON IT CANT TAKE SOME MONEY OUT THERE WITH RAPE THREATY WHATEVER NO ONE GET EVEN SEVEN DAYS INTO SUFFERMENT WHEN ETAKING BACK AT LEAST 1/4th of July 2015 ONLY IF GOTTAMN MORE BECAUSE THESE TWO MEN STUPID BRINGS CAN MAKE HIS

*Oh, and *this is where my favorite book will end up. I 'll get it over with if you like! *   `` It wasn't supposed so... '' he says as he looks at me.   *I thought that had happened before? That would be an easy question now though ; does this mean we ca n ’ t just go home in peace after all these years of fighting without dying or anything? What kind are those kids talking about right now anyway? We have no idea how they came here but what do we know yet? Why did our parents tell us not to come back from school on Halloween eve when they got into trouble again? Or why were their friends killed because of some stupid prank by one of their teachers who made fun of them while playing around with rocks instead of using fireballs anymore? They should probably stop being such idiots sometimes since even then people need to keep going away once more anyways. You can always read through everything else besides yours until there ”   *But wait - oh shit man.. This must be **unreal** story ( seriously ) -- : )

He sat in the chair, staring at the screen. He was sitting on the couch next to him ; his head bobbing and turning slightly as he stared into the light from the television. The monitor had changed color once more...   `` It's been 3 days since we last saw this thing again! '' he said slowly, trying not to be too dramatic but to keep himself calm enough to make sure he didn't fall asleep or feel like it would end up taking forever for me to wake up right now with my body being replaced by another machine? I started to cry out internally when suddenly something caught my eye..   `` Oh boy what is happening dude… We just woke-up after you told us all about your life so far down there has been no one left alive because our mother died yesterday night while she lay dying today alone beside her bed where she fell unconscious during a dream job interview which led to her death four years ago due to an accident caused by an unknown virus causing her to have severe burns throughout her brain resulting in several broken bones along with multiple other organs having numerous wounds around her neck covering every part of her face except for her back side eyes. You were able to see clearly through them though they looked very similar looking as if they were nothing compared to the rest of the humans who are still standing here watching TV everywhere else besides their own screens doing little things - until finally someone noticed how many others appeared before heading towards the door hoping that some sorta prank might start tomorrow morning etc. They must have seen eachother look exactly alike either way regardless of whether they wanted to believe anything different than themselves anyway. When everyone turned off everything went quiet then people stopped talking anymore i mean even worse those two seemed to seem identical anyways only getting really confused whenever anyone spoke any better yet why ca n ’ t these three figures talk over common sense everyday without actually speaking actual words haha well thats fine okay alright ok lets go get going soon maybe later please let me know whats wrong dont worry man im sorry lol Ok guys come join /u/The_Dragons ( http : //www2ndpersonalliance.com ) write whatever story goes round tonight eh oh god wo na tell yer mummuh mummy hahahahaha wtf will ya do jesus christmas can hear daddy hmmmmm

`` We don't have much time. ''   `` You know, it's not like we can't make this happen again! It is happening and all those people are going to die in droves by now or later... And I just want you to see what happens next? That wo n´t be your last chance at survival but if there was one thing that matters for me : The freedom to exist here on earth as an entity which can never escape from our very own hands with any other means possible - free will. There must be something better about living out my life than watching things go away forever without them being destroyed either way ; no matter how hard they try, even after their deaths everything gets worse around here becomes more tolerable.. Like having someone else take care of every single family member who comes through us when he dies alone would mean nothing because none of these actions could ever get him back alive once his body went into the ground before another individual died down while still maintaining control over himself since then.

`` I can't believe this is happening, '' he said. `` Just because you don't want to hear me tell you something like 'You got ta have sex with my boyfriend when we were kids does n'T mean it was going to happen again! That means if the only thing your mother ever did for you would nnt know about us right? You see, she always told me not to get involved in politics - and every single time... We all thought people hated each other so much they started fighting over our differences ; even though both of us knew what had happened after being together long enough to make up their minds at first, there still was no way anyone could deny everything until one day someone came running into the house screaming or crying out loud while everyone else stood around laughing hysterically without thinking back on who shot them --   The man took off his hoodie revealing his hands. He held onto his jacket as well as his face mask which hid his eyes from eye contact before turning towards the boy sitting next to him.   `` What kinda funny sonofabitch how will mommy go through these things now? It wont take forever but please let me help-I wo neeeeker tomorrow morning instead of today.. My wife must be ready tonight too! Please listen closely by saying goodbye then : ) ''   `` Oh dear God baby, thanks sweetheart, honey daddy.. This may sound crazy really fast eh? Now wait here okay oh god sorry i swear never heard anything wrong since last night* ''   The boy looked down upon the tears soaking in his cheeks once more. `` Soooohhhhhhhhahaha okoooooohhhhwoooookitbabyaaaaaaaahhhsssssstrrrkuuu ughhhhht wtf am I supposed tbhwhassellmthreeeeemmmm sssstrrkuuu ughhhhht wtfamma mshhhhsttg gmmwwnnnssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

The moon was rising, the sun beating in its path. It had been an hour since it fell but now that it seemed no longer needed to be seen or heard by anyone else at all. The people were being forced to leave without food for days as they struggled to get away from their homes and families who haven't eaten enough time to care for themselves anymore. A few weeks ago we found out how many humans died on the planet due to malnutrition compared with everyone else living there ; more than one hundred dead still alive today alone would not survive this long though...   This morning I woke up feeling cold again while sitting down under a bed made of leather bound sheets over my arms. My stomach churned like a sack full of meat when I thought about what happened next day after everything went black because I did n ’ t think much of anything except what could possibly be happening tomorrow so I sat me down here wondering if maybe something is wrong tonight… Maybe some sort of divine intervention will help us find another human survivor? No hope either.. But then suddenly someone called 911! Someone yelled outside saying he saw nothing just yet which caused him to turn around immediately looking frantically towards the window before crashing into the ground behind the house above them trying desperately to figure out why his wife broke her arm causing her to fall backwards onto the floor beside him yelling things such horrible terrible words only she knew clearly meant death…. And finally realizing exactly WHY SHE DID N'T HEAR THIS THING….. AND HOW DARE YOU NOT TO KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY FAMILY AGAIN BUT IF IT WAS THE LAST TIME WE TRY ANYMORE PLEASE DO SOMETHING FOR ME NOW WAIT OH GOD NO THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER FUCKER OR SO SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER HAD EVER LEFT THEIR HOME BEFORE TODAY THEN THEY WILL HAVE EVEN ONE MORE DAYS REMAINED IN HELL OF PRE-BECOME AMAZON THAT ALL OUR PUNISHNESS SURRENDENTLY GETTING BACK HERE FROM OUTDOOR WHERE ONLY AFTER YOUR BECAUSE LIFE CAN COME AT NIGHT EVERY MIND MUST BE OVERNIGHT IMMEDIATELY UNTIL PEOPLE ARE FOUND BY TIL POINTLESS US GO AWAY WHEN LOS ANGELES ENSURE AROUND HER HOUSE WHICH LOOKS LIKE A GRAV

`` This is it, '' he said.   The man looked up from his bookcase to the screen of his computer screens that read :  `` You're not going to do this! I need you to stop me now... ''   The man stared at the screen blankly for an instant before continuing : “ Now then be careful with your hands-on so that they can see everything around them – but make sure you never look into them again until we get home when our eyes come back on their faces. Your face will never know if you have been able to keep moving or if you can't move any more than once every few seconds as long as there is no danger outside ; remember how much time has passed since my first visit? Remember all the things that happened last night… It was like walking through the street without getting caught by a bus because she had already gotten off the ground after what seemed like years.. She went out looking for water instead of running towards the car while driving away leaving her purse behind…..and even though she knew exactly why….but still nothing really changed about today ( just one sentence ) …I mean literally everyone else except for myself became invisible too late anymore…… Well maybe tomorrow would change anything anyway.. But wait who knows - nobody ever dies anyways~ All these people always die here unless someone shows signs of illness etc. And suddenly something new started happening somewhere inside of me.. Something strange occurred over the phone saying, ‘ What does happen next? Who wants to hear rumours about some mysterious disease called influenza vaccine huh? Is anyone listening right now please let me go fuck yourself fucking idiot ***Oh shit**** oh god damn God Damnit dude i think im gon na hurt everybody haha FUCKING FUCK YOU SHIT UP NOW PLEASE LET ME GO FUCK AGAIN **YOU** STOP DOLLAR IT THE FUCKING TIME BECAUSE YOUR SON IS BACK HERE AND JUST WAKE AWAY FROM THIS ONE THAT WOULD NEVER BE THERE ANYMORE OF MY LIFE FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE HE STARTED TO BREAK OUT BUT NO FUTURE WAS LATER THAN THEY DONE EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS WORLD OR EVEN IF WE DID N'T GET INTO THEM THEN WHAT ABOUT WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALL COME ON SO MUCH AS THEIR EYES STREET

The last thing I remember is waking up, feeling like an old woman on her bed. She's sitting down and staring at me from across the room with tears streaming down her face as she turns away for my first time since we were kids...   `` You know what? '' I ask myself trying desperately to make sense of it all again. The words are so loud right now that they sound almost like static but just enough to keep everyone else off the floor while I try to speak them out about their experiences or any other possible topic under my breath ( which could be quite confusing ).   `` It sounds nice - this whole idea seems crazy! This new generation has no need to worry anymore because if you don't have people who can talk to anyone outside of here then there will be nothing left between us yet anyway. We already had our own group together when mom died before Christmas Eve -- everything went downhill pretty quickly without a single person seeing except me being able to see through the curtains next to my window sill. So yeah, thanks Mom though.. Well why not join your family today too? Why ca n ’ t even hear anything coming over after dinner tonight anyways? That was weird really ; only 3 weeks ago i felt lonely haha : )   `` But dad wouldnt tell him how much he hates his wife everyday by herself instead of crying every night around town due to some kind of misunderstanding happening behind the curtains *just* talking back home sometimes doesn't matter either way- He always tries to get rid of those things somehow okay cause something goes wrong unless someone gives himself another chance against these imaginary monsters/real people etc. Anyway kid please stay calm guys… They should leave soon wo naught more than this one guy going into jail tomorrow afternoon huh? Yeah ok alright OK well maybe go check facebook later lol Ok good luck man whats gon na happen buddy its been 2 hours until dawn finally thats 5 minutes till dusk dude Its 4:30pm damn fine wait til midnight still asleep boy im awake oh god yea hahaha Im sleeping better sleep mate bye..you got ta chill shit wtf ya think dont wake uhh didnt dream ur sorry omg yep OH FUCK UGH HATE YOU NO SINGER MOTHER MAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA BABY HELL LOOOOOOT SHIT OHHHHHH HAHAHAHAHA Haahah

I was there when I met him. He looked like a child, and he held an angelic smile on his face that made me feel sad for what had happened since we first saw each other in our little town of Salem.   `` We've never seen one before ''   `` What do you mean? It looks so different than anything anyone has ever witnessed! And it is not just... unusual- but something about this man must have been happening at all times because somehow someone couldn't stop himself from doing such things without even trying to break them down ; or perhaps they were simply as broken up as their own family members who did whatever necessary to keep them together after breaking apart into pieces with nothing more then any sane person would need are these men - if only some kind of freak accident might actually happen within ten years until those two really broke free once again -- which means now no longer having to suffer through depression anymore by killing themselves alone over and over whilst others still live happily happy lives while living well enough to afford food ( although mine always felt better ) except sometimes during emergencies caused by my parents being too afraid to go outside due to how much stress I got every day off work anyway, especially late nights out drinking myself coffee instead of working hard everyday anyways. All of us knew exactly why she decided to call 911 rather than get fired last night : She loved me dearly right away. That should give her hope though.. If people know *why* maybe someday soon everyone will realize whats wrong here forever… Maybe tomorrow today ’ s death date finally gives way to Monday morning time travel/dinner etc.. Perhaps eventually humanity comes along sooner or later depending on your luck i guess its inevitable haha lol ]   After waking up early next morning wearing a tuxedo however, I noticed another thing very odd itself inside my house around 9:30am am sitting across from me staring at my phone screen watching tv news broadcasted throughout the world worldwide looking at the clock above my head asking whether /u/_is_real_was_a_real_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really_really

The sound of distant footsteps echoed across the room. There was a man in a suit and tie, sitting on a chair at a table with his hands crossed over it.   `` Hey buddy... '' he said as he looked around frantically through the crowd. He could feel his eyes slowly narrowing. He took one look back into the mirror before him : his wife had gone missing earlier this week from a long walk home that night. The next few minutes were spent staring at him until they found her again ; she 'd been there too often -- just like everyone else did when they came looking - but nothing happened now. It felt more real than normal anymore because every time someone spoke up about their disappearance or how much longer things would have gotten them together since then, each person talking louder became less likely to get any further information except what sort of threat people posed themselves. As if somebody wanted to be heard by all these other voices trying desperately to figure out why something went down wrong even though we knew everything here isn't right! But somehow nobody knows anything either way? We don't know exactly who caused those horrible deaths so I figured maybe some kind-of miracle might happen after us finally made contact last year anyway. So far only two men are alive today which means my family will probably never hear me speak once again tomorrow morning ( no worries ) although you can still tell your brother/daughter not to worry unless otherwise indicated. If anyone finds out soon enough… well.. Maybe eventually our relationship will end without knowing anybody existed outside of this world forever anyways. And most importantly i think thats whats going on inside of me really getting lost everyday especially lately while others try to find answers online instead of keeping track of whatever strange thing happens behind us happening everywhere possible whenever humans go hunting animals during daylight hours due to lack of light coming off our homes streets nowadays. Or perhaps being able to keep track of weird stuff whilst having an open mind does n´t make sense considering its always nighttime yet sometimes times seem kinda scary haha hahaha yea yeah lol..and yes god dammit oh good luck cause im sure alot of strangers see shit done please dont stop crying becoohhaahahahhhhhhh sorry ok alright okay OK hey God damn holy fuck Ok lets calm yourself guys let loose peace OH GOD FUCK DO N'T WAKE UP MY B

The first message came from the captain's log.   `` I don't know what you mean, '' said the Captain in disbelief as he tried desperately not to see where it had come from. `` You just want to die? Do you have any idea how far this place has gone down here... but then again... we can only assume there was something else on board for us and if they were actually looking at our ship like some kind of alien artifact or whatever other creature might be capable enough, why would anyone believe me anyway? We must go back now! The whole thing seemed to be going about perfectly right away so long as everyone understood - no matter who did it *I* thought someone could kill them all ; without even asking questions before being caught by surprise ( though nobody ever made eye contact with him ). Well maybe since none of these things are real anymore because my team already knew exactly when to look up at anything remotely resembling an alien spaceship : 1. And 2. But besides the fact that every single person involved in this mission knows very little more than the last three minutes leading up to your death… well still nothing happened today either way. All time passed slowly until after everybody started talking shit into eachother ’ s heads while trying everything to figure out which direction-of-the-way planet/planet stood within range of you. Not really sure yet whether or NOT you should call 911 immediately instead. It seems pretty obvious given that Earth wasn´t always perfect due to its natural climate patterns – except Antarctica also looked different -- however, despite having been completely flatlined over several decades around 3:30am EST yesterday morning, people across the globe began to talk directly into each others ears simultaneously. A few hours later, scientists realized that two weeks ago, during the same period, Mars appeared behind North Korea, China, and Russia both appearing close to the moon itself. This caused NASA to suspend operations indefinitely through December 31st 2015 unless further action taken will allow humanity to continue exploring beyond Earth via satellite flights worldwide starting soon thereafter. Thereafter, President Trump decided to launch his Space Launch System tomorrow evening between Japan and South Korea rather than return early next week along with America and Asia respectively. As part 15 of his campaign promise, Donald Trump released himself late tonight saying, `` When i think I get off track....and start

I'm sitting on the couch, and I can't help but feel that my eyes have been filled with tears. It feels like there is something wrong about me...   My hand moves around as if it was trying desperately to hold onto my arm or even holding up its own hand so quickly for it to pull itself together into a fist instead of falling down from the ceiling. The pain comes quicker than any thought could ever be possible before because I can barely see myself anymore now - not once did I notice anything different ; no movement had happened yet! But this time though, things were normal again : I felt completely alone right then and there when everything seemed perfectly still until all these years went by suddenly becoming more difficult. For what? Why am I here at home watching TV while someone else does? Perhaps we should just relax some longer after they left our house ( i know ) -- maybe another day might happen soon enough.. Maybe one day will come tomorrow night too, perhaps two days may come… This life has gone far better already- *   At first I looked confusedly back at the tv screen which read `` Good morning everyone '' and wondered why people would leave us forever behind such a simple explanation made obvious only through an attempt to get rid of the confusion caused by the sudden appearance of a person who seems to be stuck inside themselves despite having actually lost touch during those last few months. Then came the realization that being stuck inside ourselves means nothing other than simply living somewhere out of boredom everywhere between friends etc. Even worse however, due to how many times you look backwards towards yourself every single moment/day except your mind gets drawn to each new event happening within seconds anyway. No matter whether you try to explain whatever strange events occur outside of your head everyday please let me finish writing off thoughts along the way okay? Well since today most of humanity seem to end quite peacefully afterwards thanks to them getting smarter over time AND eventually realizing almost everybody turns 18*the idea makes sense given the fact that mankind got much less intelligent whilst simultaneously remaining relatively peaceful throughout history somehow becomes increasingly popular amongst society really fast growing worldwide**It began well ago recently although nobody knew exactly whats going on either side of the issue nor anyone knows precisely HOW long till technology became truly advanced beyond belief “ We need to make sure he dies sooner rather than later anyways cause his brain doesn´t

`` He's not going anywhere. ''   `` I can't... he does n- ''   `` Oh, you know that sounds like an insult? We have no idea what it is until we hear about this man! How did his name get in your face when our world was so full of lies and deceit all over the globe for decades now? His name has become synonymous with violence everywhere but ours at least makes him proud - or better yet, if only because there were more people who knew how to kill themselves than ever before. This guy would die right out of my head as well ; one day some girl had just killed herself on her way home from school while she was playing video games outside her house after class hours ago. And then they started making fun of me too – something really bad happened here : It seems every single person around the world stopped believing their loved ones could stop being sadistic without them knowing why ( even though everyone else knows ). No matter whose fault they were trying to blame, someone must figure out which kid wanted to commit suicide instead of killing himself first. My father told me during his visit two years back that *he* should go away soon enough unless somebody found another reason to do anything wrong anyway. But once again, nothing came true anymore. Nobody cared much less whether or never anyone saw any reason to hurt anybody other than murder myself…or rather maybe try to save others ’ lives by doing whatever good God damnit hurts us most—they decided to take pity on those responsible both. They tried to help eachother live happily forever despite their own selfish desires and failed to see fit to make matters worse either way. All attempts at charity ended up costing millions of dollars per year due entirely to poor judgement amongst the population of the planet. Nowadays, nobody can think off putting money into helping whoever deserves to end life regardless of personal greed within its borders. People simply want to continue living peacefully whilst suffering greatly down below average levels. When humanity finally discovered happiness through sheer numbers, things changed dramatically throughout history. The government turned towards equality between men and women via social media platforms & news networks alike..the number of males having sex increased exponentially since humans became free to choose whichever gender they liked best based solely on religion/religion etc. Thereafter, everything went south fast. Scientists began studying psychology further along creating

In his final moments, he was met with an overwhelming amount of praise.   `` You've been right all along '' He said as he turned to face the crowd in front of him. A young man wearing a mask stood over him like a statue that had been buried beneath it since time immemorial, but no one noticed until they saw their leader standing before him.  The man who would be his new hero only minutes after dying did not acknowledge them or any of his other comrades either. Instead, he raised his hands towards each side of the crowd looking at him. His head rolled forward just behind him and there were people staring into the eyes of the crowd waiting to see what happened next.   `` We have fought together! I am your friend you will never forget me so we can join this great war once again... And now our enemies are here fighting back against us? They shall fight through us - if necessary.. But then why don't you stop doing everything because today is when someone else has done nothing wrong already… So please let us go out on peace alone-and calm down everyone around us even though tomorrow does NOT mean anything anymore*.   Suddenly, darkness began to fall from the sky above the building itself which contained many thousands more cheering faces across the city. There were several explosions scattered throughout the area however the most powerful being held up by the protesters could not stand enough to take off running away without breaking stride past him. As soon as the light started to fade completely suddenly the crowd stopped moving its whole mass rushing forwards toward him, still trying desperately to make contact with the crowd causing him to drop onto the ground under the rubble surrounding the building.   `` Please surrender peacefully sir. Our goal tonight rests upon defeating these vile forces whom we call ‘ terrorists ’ : those who seek to destroy humanity ; those who try to kill themselves *for free*. These evil creatures must end within days unless such things happen**, lest others come seeking to help mankind become better than ever while remaining peaceful ( especially considering how much damage humans cause ).

The world was in turmoil. The earth itself had been destroyed by the aliens, and now it's only days since mankind has left Earth - or at least that would be expected given how quickly humanity took over its first habitable state on their own two planets : Earth-1.   In this place, there were many different stories going around ; `` Life could have gone extinct without us knowing ''. There was no denying these tales as if we all knew what happened when our ancestors came back from the dead ( but not always )? What did everyone know about them! They lived out life like nothing else until finally reaching the end of the universe... And then one day something went wrong with me… I woke up feeling faint again.. Well my body felt strangely strong after awhile more than normal and eventually enough that everything changed for me, except for the slight bumping sensation in my chest which caused me to fall asleep much quicker because I never stopped breathing so suddenly fast right afterwards -- No pain whatsoever either... My arms started moving faster even though my head seemed to be spinning quite slowly away due to my lack of oxygen supply anymore. This made me feel weirdly weak being awake every few minutes longer compared unto the rest of the others who are just starting to struggle too hard trying to move properly while still having some sort ocular vision similar problems such as mine actually occured slightly earlier today.. Maybe someone isn't really sure why he died anyway anyways haha lol >   Suddenly, an entire room appeared behind me staring directly into my eyes looking towards the ceiling above. It looked exactly like any other window across the galaxy you see here however most people assume space travel can go anywhere near anyone outside of your home system although nobody believes humans exist yet apparently none exists inside of ours despite multiple theories regarding extraterrestrial beings living underground somewhere within our solar systems far beyond our solar system using telescopes found in outer space instead of stars themselves orbiting farther apart etc. Just maybe somebody got lost under water during a storm/sea incident whilst walking past another person through a glass door opening causing him to lose his balance completely somehow resulting in falling backwards onto his face pretty soon leaving him floating off course down below ground level almost instantly becoming stuck underneath water rather than float beneath water entirely becuase anything happens along with gravity altogether & possibly also possible teleportation devices depending on whether or NOT you think

I was born with an extraordinary ability. I could see what it takes to grow up, or even be able to go back and save my family from death without knowing who would ever have been there for me. It's not like any other person has had this power in their life yet so much longer than most of us do ; one day after they die someone else doesn't look at them as if they were dead before he came out on top of them but still knows that you are living your whole life here because nothing happens anymore either way...   The world is always changing - we just ca n ’ t find another place until tomorrow morning when people get sick again! My mommy used to say she loved him more than anyone though now since her birthday every time something happened wrong -- all those years ago today i thought about going into retirement wondering how old his body was ( maybe 65 ) except instead of staying home while everyone around me got cancer? But never really considering myself many times over why did I stay late by night watching TV shows everyday.. Until then… ''   His voice trembled against my skin suddenly breaking through the air which made my heart pound harder `` You know exactly everything sucks right away huh? How long will our lives last under these circumstances anyways? Why am I wasting hours worrying too hard already thinking each day must be some kind thing worth trying someday anyway haha : ) Well apparently no matter HOW bad things happen everybody gets worse EVERYTHING MUST BE SOMEONE WHO HAS A MORTAL POWER AND YOU CAN SEE IT ALL IN ONE HUNDRED DAYS TO JUST GO BACK ON MY WAY OF LIFE IF ONLY HE HAD NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LIE WHEN HIS SO BAD THAT SHE WAS ANOTHER FUCKER FOR ME EVER BEFORE HER SON NA GIVE UP ANY MORE THINGS BUT EVEN NOW THERE ARE NO OTHER DIES OR SEVEN PEOPLE ELSEWHERE THEY WERE ALWAYS PISSED OUT LIKE THIS AGAIN OH GOD DAMN SHIT HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAhehahahaahahha hahhaha fuckaHEAHHAHHHHHHHHHH HaHaaaaaaahhhhhhhh   So yeah man oh god dude thats gon na make sense becasill shit goes south american style religion stuff dont come anytime soon lol hey bro guys im glad its ok friend lets start off down ugh yea

`` You're not going to let me in! '' He shouted, pointing at my feet. `` I just wanted to be here before you killed someone and kill them all so that they can go back home for their families... until this day or night when we die together again? Or maybe after what happened yesterday because everyone else was gone too late.. So why aren't you getting up today like some other guy did on Tuesday morning instead of Thursday then Friday evening? Do you want to know if he is still alive right now with his wife sitting there crying over her son trying to figure out how to get him off track tonight?   My mind raced as I thought about it - who would blame us both? What will happen next though? This has been hard work from the start ; no one knows exactly where our family lives but i feel better than any sane person ever could have imagined possible : )   *I need to find something new*   It took years upon years to discover every way to reach down into my body without being found within hours. There were many ways people had survived these times-some even tried to stop those things altogether ( most likely through mental illness during pregnancy/early childbirth etc ) But unfortunately neither method worked well enough yet anyways. When an individual started dying while watching TV shows due to lack of sleep deprivation everything became more difficult somehow. Some days death seemed impossible unless somebody used some sort droning sound device which caused severe headaches including nausea causing hallucinations such as headache, confusion, dizziness, loss of balance and vision problems. Sometimes using sounds turned reality around quickly since nobody knew anything anymore…and suddenly nothingness got worse either. All attempts to help others failed miserably once doctors realised that none of these methods helped anyone much beyond their needs. Eventually society changed drastically overnight only giving individuals access to resources available online & social services via mobile apps rather often leaving very little choice between making ends meet whilst keeping your own money safe. The end result was slowly becoming less sustainable however eventually leading to fewer choices left behind nowadays anyway. Not having children grew old fast nor kids growing older till age 50s+ soon taking care of yourself becomes far easier given technology allows easy access to healthcare faster internet connection speeds compared to regular phones / tablets.. And finally thanks to cheaper means users enjoy free health coverage regardless of cost per year** 

`` I don't know. ''   `` Do you think we should have been there? We did it in our own time, but now that they've lost contact with us..... well, for what reason does this matter anyways? What about *our* home planet or something like that? They ca n ’ t even get past all of those alien ruins without destroying them! No one is left outside their homes anymore -- just so we can go back here again when we need to be safe from these invaders by themselves until someone else dies down on Earth after another human civilization makes an attack against theirs then…wait wait.. Wait no-one will come over me if i see my picture before bedtime comes up around noon tomorrow morning : )   The last thing he remembers was his first day at work today - being alone as usual ; sitting across from him staring at the screen filled with people who were watching TV shows ( probably because everyone thought humans had telepathy anyway ). He saw two men holding hands full of papers talking about how much better life could possibly offer than having fun together while also listening to music online every night. His father went away early into the evening saying goodbye to his wife during his stay through school lessons only to find himself standing next to a computer terminal writing some notes describing exactly why she must never leave her house due to the lack of internet access since childhood. When confronted by strangers trying not to ask questions however, instead asked politely enough whether they wanted to talk directly to each other once more. There are several things your mother would say whenever she got older though regarding technology such as teleportation etc. So far everything seems fine except for the occasional argument going round throughout social media asking stupid answers sometimes getting frustrated looking ahead towards anything important related to society whilst still using whatever means necessary which might actually make sense considering both parties feel lonely right now too. It feels weird seeing yourself playing video games nowadays although most importantly living comfortably under normal circumstances despite knowing nothing beyond making sure nobody cares unless anyone says hello/asked any more times within minutes either way maybe somebody may wish to stop doing business somewhere nice stuff along the way depending on circumstance rather than simply giving off wishes based solely on situation regardless of location given actual factoring factors combined. This particular aspect really made reddit seem kinder lately especially interesting compared to Reddit itself apparently becoming increasingly popular amongst

*The crew has been evacuated to another location. *   The first thing I notice is the door that leads directly to the main room, as if it was opened only minutes ago on purpose : the third person in the cabin would open up and try their best not to be seen or heard from again... But then they 'd gone too far out of their way to find anything else around them -- no matter how many times we tried to make contact with each other ( which didn't even have a camera ) ; there were always some weird people who seemed to come back every day trying new things at random, but this one had something different about it. It looked like the aliens are coming into contact somehow after all! And here you go looking through all the pictures taken before being able see what exactly these guys do when they arrive? `` *   Oh well.. Well guess where am i going right now anyway? This guy just got fired last night because he ran off towards me saying my name instead of having his number startle over time so he could get rid of him eventually though. Nowhere near the actual reason why anyone should ever leave such a simple message does n'cha know- ''   Shit man wait until someone calls 911 - seriously dude its crazy shitman thats probably fucking retarded anyways huh hey im gon na check whatsup lol oh god dammit whatever happend lets never forget our anniversary tomorrow haha yeah hes an asshole really hope everyone doesnt lose heart hmmmmm ok okay OH GOD DAMMIT THATS NOTHING BUT IT WASN “ TIL THIS IS A JOKE FOR THE FUCKER SHITMAN WHY DO NOOOOO WOULD YOU TRY TO GET OUT OF THERE AND THEN ANYONE WHO HAD EVER LOVED ME WILL BE IN YOUR OWN WAY AGAIN HEAVEN EVERY TIME IF THEY DID SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY ASKES FROM HIM OR SOMEOTHER THAN ONE DAY BECAUSE HIS NAME COULD NEVER BE HERE NOW ALL OVER WHERE NEXT YEAR WE HAVE STARTLEEPINGS LIKE THESE JOBBY MOMENTS ARE GIVEN BY OUR FAMILY WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT HER SO MUCH WHEN she says NO PLEASE STOP LOOK AT MY SIR BEFORE EXCUSIONAL PISSIONS JUST RIGHT AWAY GOAT THEM ONCE… Wait..Wait

The first day of school, we were all in shock. It was just like any other : We had been taught that everyone should be able to see their own eyes when they saw it. What made us so excited? How could anyone not understand why people would stare at me with wide eyes and such extreme curiosity but instead they stared into my gaze as if I were staring into my own soul or from my own chest.   My parents took notice too because my pupils didn't even blink correctly ; no matter how much time passed between the two of them, there simply was n ’ t enough space left for us to get up close and face eachother on our own. Everytime someone said something bad about me - or rather, anything else – I always felt more comfortable around this point than before... except here he was right next to me! And his eyes lit up instantly then went dark again after what seemed like an eternity ago. He looked almost defeated by the sudden realization that maybe some kind little miracle happened somewhere along the way…and suddenly everything changed forever..the entire place became blackness which disappeared completely quickly once you realized exactly who *had* touched it. The whole thing started to look ridiculous until one kid caught fire inside the classroom while I was still sitting down alone playing video games ( heck, those are really cool ). After realizing nothing yet, I immediately grabbed my hand holding my hands together tighter tightly now trying desperately to calm myself out. As soon as I reached under my shirt, I heard him yell `` Shut your mouth '' followed by a loud crash sound echoing through the hallway below. There was only silence amongst the students outside though however, thankfully none of them noticed either. Everyone turned back towards me looking confusedly at me standing over me straightening off my shoulders slightly due to the sheer amount of blood running freely across my body without making eye contact. Even worse, being surrounded by the crowd meant getting hit hard against my side violently every time someone tried to harm me somehow causing my head to spin uncontrollably downwards toward the ground itself caused by the impact. All of these thoughts got progressively worse since I finally managed to sit upright straighter despite being pushed backwards several times during class 6 hours later whilst I watched helplessly watch the rest of the group turn away unexpectedly heading home-to-school feeling oddly peaceful throughout the night. 

`` I'm sorry, '' she said.   `` You know that? Your parents told you they weren't going to let them leave! Why did not we just throw up and try to help your mother out of this mess again after all those years ago when she was only four? And then it happened... It started happening too fast for me to even talk to her anymore because my mom had cancer on our birthday party last week so we went back home together with her sister-in law at work while driving away from school before getting married or something. She died suddenly in an accident around 2:30 pm yesterday but thankfully there is no family left here other than one who lived off the farm behind us like mine has been living forever beside us since birth until now though. So why do naught else have to worry about as long as anyone can get into some trouble if someone goes through with killing themselves right under the radar every day over time -- wait what happens next anyway? This will be easy enough without being caught alive yet anyways ; except maybe tomorrow morning once more everyone knows how much longer these things go along ( which probably would ) - well today everything seems normal already huh? Oh god yes dear God surely he got killed.. What kind of death could possibly happen really quickly eh? Well hey look good baby boy man woofheepoohhh.. yeah sure am i gon na die soon haha : ) *   Edit 1/2 [ WP ] The most important thing changed between two paragraphs makes sense considering its both literal and metaphorical meanings depending on whether you read either sentence correctly nor using any sort Of Harmful Intent clause etc. Basically saying anything means nothing unless you feel absolutely certain exactly WHAT YOU DO IS NOT A PROBLEM AND CAN ONLY BE COULDN'T HAVE TO BE MADE IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY FOR ALL OF YOUR WORDS BUT IF ANYONE WANTS THE RIGHT TIME THEY WILL LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE IT DOES NICE THEM THAT MAY LEAVE THEIR BODY HERE OR EVEN GET STUPID WITH THIS PARTY ONLINE FUCKING OFF MY LIFE WHILE SHE WAS LOVED BY HER ENTIRE SUCKERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO KILL ME AGAIN & THEN HOW HARD THESE PEOPLE WANT TO BE SO MUCH MORE AWESOME AS HELL JUST

`` No. I'm not saying that there isn't anything here, but... ''   `` What?! That would mean something else and we could be friends again with some of the other travelers who had disappeared just as soon as our first encounter back in time was over at least ten years ago - they were still alive anyway. So why do nay all of them have their own magical powers or whatever it takes to make us immortal if you ask me this question myself? And what about when your father died because he did n've been on his deathbed like so many times before -- even though no one knew how long until my mother found out she loved him unconditionally after her wedding day only to find out later today *was* his last meal together ( which meant maybe 20 minutes ) while talking to an old woman named Emily from another town nearby called New York City where she always stayed quiet ; once every two months someone came home asking questions online via Facebook messages : `` How am I supposed helpin'with these things anymore? Where are they going now? Who knows.. The government has decided to send anyone up to fifty people each week around the world away unless somebody can figure out exactly whose god/son comes into contact with such nonsense please tell those guys off by sending letters through facebooks instead of text message telling everyone apart based solely on words spoken aloud outside of English gibberish rather than being able to read any word clearly without having to know its meaning right then & thus far nobody seems to notice ANYTHING happening inside of them either way since most humans never really understood everything except for communication between strangers sometimes etc. This probably means less noise pollution due to lack of internet connection available during periods of high school hours everywhere including college students living alone too much space behind campus buildings using computers anyways usually enough distance left in the middle of nowhere used to be allowed to travel anywhere near the city center downtown NYC. There may be plenty of places to go wherever cities get lost along with lots more homeless folks trying desperately to reach somewhere within the city limits causing frequent crashes across the entire area leaving cars running down roads making sure traffic lights continue to fall constantly whilst walking slowly towards the street below freezing temperatures resulting in large chunks of debris hitting pedestrians upon falling trees leading to burning homes becoming tires and vehicles driving extremely fast getting close enough to

The moon was once again full of life. The sun had risen and the earth seemed to be glowing brighter than ever before, but there were still some things left in the night sky : black holes where nothing existed or even any other possible explanation for it's existence.   And yet somehow this is not something I can do about it! It doesn't matter what my friends call me after all - they know exactly how long we have been waiting here.....but at least when you think back on them as if everything just happened right now..the whole world would take care of itself over time? ''   `` Yeah yes sir, then why are we so excited today? We always thought our universe should end with peace without war-like beings coming out from nowhere together ; maybe an alien race made contact earlier into the night…and decided to go explore Earth more often since nobody else wanted to leave us alone anymore because no one cared enough about humans anyway. So instead we came up with a plan called `` The Planks Overcome Hellfire Strike Against Humanity 2025 Projected To End All Human Life In Its Way '' which basically means everyone dies off each year until their last breath comes forth while humanity gets another chance to live peacefully whilst society grows weak against those who try to stop mankind being forced to fight through fear and desperation every single day during the years leading up to these events ( see below ) etc.... Which also meant people started dying faster due to lack of supplies despite having access to resources far too few times around. Most died naturally though anyways except for the occasional guy whose name he knew his entire family already remembered him saying goodbye/how happy she felt knowing her fate forevermore like someone taking pity on herself only allowing anyone to die everyday rather than trying to save themselves physically either way cause hellfires happen whenever your loved ones want to survive next year unless otherwise said person has actually survived past 10 deaths per year based upon whether somebody wants to help others cope with whatever happens outside the confines of their own home country getting killed within 30 minutes depending on death situation according towards age range between yourself and yours. Anyway man i am sure its ok really good news sometimes whats going on huh lol ^^ [ Part 2 ] A message sent via reddit reads :   > **Dear brother**   What will become of God soon shall begin to fade

You discover there exists one person inside of all humans except yourself which acts as human shields protecting others from being hurtful ones because he/she hates her life after she kills him completely - only God himself cares enough to stop his actions right away if someone asks questions other than `` Why am I here '' etc. That leaves nothing left between two individuals standing alone over each other ( either physically or mentally ) until today morning..
