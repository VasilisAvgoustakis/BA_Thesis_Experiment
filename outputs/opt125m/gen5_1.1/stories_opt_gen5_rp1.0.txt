I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. The protagonist has no idea how he got there or why he s here. He does nt even know where he is. But then again maybe it was just some sort of dream or something. Either way it does nt matter because he knows exactly who he is. So let s get started. My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve always wanted to go back home so when my parents told me that they would take care of me until I graduated high school I thought it was pretty cool. They said that if I ever needed anything they d be right behind me. After all I could use some help getting into college. When I turned eighteen I decided to start writing stories based off of my own experiences. It took me several years to get used to the idea of being able to write without having to worry about getting caught up in the plot. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing there staring at me with those eyes that looked like they were trying to tell me something important. Hey buddy what s up What happened You re late again. How can I help you today Well... well I guess we should start by saying that you re going to need some help getting through your first chapter. That s right. We ll try our best to make sure everything works out okay Yeah yeah. Let s go. As soon as we leave the room I hear footsteps coming closer. I run over to where they came from and see them sitting down next to each other. They both stare at me blankly. Then one of them says Hey John Smith. Are you okay Yeah I m fine. Just... just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything else. Okay. Thanks. Bye. ive never written before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

omes.ICLE. The teacher looked at me with his big blue eyes and said You re not supposed to be here. He turned away from me and walked over to the door where he opened it. Inside was a small room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pens. There were also two chairs on either side of him. One chair had a large wooden handle and another had a metal one. Both chairs were empty except for one chair which sat on top of it. My heart sank when I saw what happened next. A man wearing an old fashioned robe stood there staring into space. His face was covered by dark circles under his eyes. What s wrong kid he asked. Nothing just wanted to see how much time passed since we last spoke. Well... I guess it does nt matter now. We ll get through this together. Just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything else. Just relax. And so I did. When I got home I found myself sitting on my bed watching TV while waiting for the next student to come along. After about minutes of watching the news I decided to take a nap. As soon as I fell asleep I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on my door. I quickly ran downstairs and knocked twice more before answering. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today I asked. Oh yeah well... I mean... I m sorry about your circle. But I think you might need some help getting rid of it. Can you tell me why I ca nt find anything else I nodded slowly. Because Ima little late. That makes sense. So what happens if I try to change it again I shrugged. Nothing really. Just keep trying until eventually you find something interesting. Then you can go back to your normal life. Okay okay. Let s see how long until we meet again. ive been working on this for years now and i still have nt figured out how to use it yet. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

the year. I ve never seen anything like it before. The first thing that came to mind was how much money i d made off selling drugs back then but then again maybe its just me. My parents were both rich so they did nt really care about me anyway. They d always told me that if you could make someone happy then maybe they would give up their lives too. So when I saw him walking down the street with his head down I knew something was wrong. He looked like someone who had been through hell and back again. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and he wore an old suit with a tie. It seemed as though he d never seen anything like it before. Then there was the fact that he had no idea where he was going or why he was here. There was nothing else to do except wait for him to come back home. When he finally arrived at his destination he took off his shoes and put them on. As soon as he stepped inside he started running towards me. Hey buddy what s up What happened Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why ca nt you move I asked. Well... uhm... I guess we should call you Mr. President. You re probably wondering why I m here right now. Well... well... I mean... I m not exactly sure where I am either. But I think I ll go ahead and tell you anyway. Ima superhero. And I m going to help you find your way home. That sounds great. Let s see what happens next. I walked over to him and hugged him tight. We talked for hours until finally he gave up and said goodbye. After a few minutes I decided to ask him what happened. Do you remember when we met Yes sir. That s right. We went out on our first date. She was beautiful. Her skin was soft her lips were red and she smiled every time she saw me. We spent hours talking about everything from our childhoods to our future careers. Eventually she gave up on me and moved away. I thought maybe she wanted to leave us behind but I knew better than to try. I tried calling her but she would nt answer. Finally after several

in which your mind is not only aware of what you are thinking but also aware of the fact that you are not alone. You can hear everything from people around you and they re always looking at you with those eyes that look like they ve seen too much horror movies. They ll say something like Ima monster or something but then they wo nt really understand why. When I was younger my parents would tell me stories about how their precognitionikers were used by people who had no idea what they were doing. Nowadays everyone knows exactly what they want from their own precognitionikers. It s just that there are so many different types of precognitions that it makes sense to never know which one is real. So here I am sitting in front of my computer waiting for my turn to use my precognitionikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikerikeriker

You know how much fun i t is when someone dies from cancer Well yeah but that does n t mean they die from heart failure. They just get sicker and sicker until they finally pass away. That s why I m here today. To help you understand what happened. What did you say I asked. Oh nothing really. Just... well... I guess I should say something else. I said.

of me. I ve never seen anyone like this before. The mirror showed me as a young man with dark hair and blue eyes. His face was covered by thick glasses which he wore every day. He looked like he d just gotten out of bed from a long day s work. But there were no wrinkles or scars anywhere on him. It seemed normal enough. Then again maybe it did nt matter much anyway. After all if there was nothing else to do besides wait for the mirror to turn red then maybe it would nt matter anyway. As soon as I saw him I knew something was wrong. Something about him made me feel uneasy. Like someone had taken control of me. My heart sank into my stomach. What if this guy really did have a mirror What if he was actually looking at me Why would he want to talk to me anyway I tried to move away from him but he kept coming closer. Eventually I managed to get close enough to touch his shoulder. Hey buddy what s up I asked. Nothing really. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. Yeah yeah. Well I guess we should go home now. We walked down the street towards our car. When we arrived at our destination I opened the door and stepped inside. There were people everywhere. Some were dressed in black others in white. They all stared at us with wide eyes. One woman stood next to me her hands behind her back. She smiled at me as she spoke. Hi there. How are you feeling today She asked. Good. I replied. Are you okay She nodded. Yes. Just tired. Do you mind if I sit down She laughed. Sure thing. Let s go. I followed her outside. As we approached our house I noticed something odd. There was no sign of any kind of mirror anywhere else. All I could see was darkness. I closed my eyes and waited for the light to fade away. When it finally came I realized that I was still alive. I opened my mouth to speak but stopped myself. I felt  

overed in ancient times. The first thing I noticed was how much money had been made from selling my soul t o the devil. He said that if you could sell your soul t o him then you d get t o live forever. That s right. You can sell your soul t o anyone else but they wo nt believe you. They ll think Ima crazy person who wants t o die. And yet here we are. We re all just trying t o make ends meet. So what happens when I die What happens next Well... well... I guess I should say goodbye. My parents died when I was young. They had cancer and passed away shortly after. When I turned eighteen I decided t o go home and spend time with them again. After all I did nt really care about being alone anymore. But now... well... I ca nt help but wonder why I ever came back. Why would anyone want t o see me again Because I knew exactly where I needed t o go. There were many things I wanted t o learn about history and culture. First off there was nothing wrong with being alive. Second there was nothing wrong with having friends. Third there was nothing wrong with having family members. Fourth there was nothing wrong with having friends. Fifth there was nothing wrong with having friends. Sixth there was nothing wrong with having friends.

apers. The people were shocked when they saw what appeared to be an old man standing before them. He wore a white robe with a black hat covering his head. His eyes were wide open as he stared at them. What s wrong kid You re not supposed to look like this. I m sorry sir but we ca nt allow you to go back in time. We ve got some things we need to tell you before we can make any progress. But first let me explain why you re here today. My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations. And I am here today because I have been chosen by God himself as our new leader. This man said as he walked away from the podium. Well... yeah. That makes sense. But how did he get there Why would he want me dead anyway Because I was born into this world. And now I m going to die. So what happens next John asked. Well... well... I guess I ll find out soon enough. As soon as I get home. Then let s go. I followed him down the hall towards my car where I drove off into the distance. When I arrived at my house I opened the door and stepped inside. Inside was a large room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor displayed a picture of me and my wife. She looked so happy when she saw us. Her face lit up when she realized that we were still alive. Hey honey. How s it going I asked. Good. Just fine. Do you mind if I sit down I nodded. Sure thing. Let s start with something simple. First off I think I might need some help getting rid of these pictures. They seem to be showing pictures of us everywhere. Second they seem to be showing pictures of animals. Third they seem to be showing pictures of humans. Fourth they seem to be showing pictures of animals. Fifth they seem to be showing pictures of humans. Sixth they seem to be showing pictures of animals. Seventh they seem to be showing pictures of humans. Eighth they seem to be showing pictures of animals. Ninth they seem to be showing pictures of  

awning. The object was a small box with a red button on top. Inside were two buttons one labeled cooking required to use object.awning. The object was also a large metal object with a black lid. Inside were three other objects each containing their own buttons. They all looked like they belonged there. One of them had a red button on top while another had a blue button on bottom. In front of me sat a man wearing a white lab coat and sunglasses. He spoke softly into his radio. Welcome back Mr. Smith. We hope you enjoyed your stay here.

upvotes for creativity and difficulty. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. The man was tall and thin with dark hair that fell down over his shoulders. He wore glasses which looked like they had been worn out from years of use. His eyes were wide open as he stared at me from across the room. You could see tears welling up in them as he spoke. Hello there. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy from New York City who has just met someone named Jesus Christ. We ve always known each other since childhood and we re both very happy together. So why do nt we go out sometime later then Well... I started. It seems like every day since then I ve gotten closer to him. Every night since then I feel like I need to tell him everything about myself. What happened to your parents Why did they die How long has it been since they last saw each other John shrugged. They died when I was young. And then there s this one time where I got into trouble because I tried to steal something from a store. That s when things changed. There was no way I could get rid of it without getting caught. But I guess I ll try anyway. As soon as I saw him walking towards me I knew something was wrong. Something about him made me want to run away from him. So I ran after him. When I finally reached the end of the road I noticed that he was gone. I thought maybe he d gone insane or something. Maybe he was just trying to scare me away from him. After all I did nt know where he went wrong. Then I heard a loud bang behind me. I turned around and saw him standing there staring at me. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah. Just a little worried. Do nt worry. Just stay calm. Okay. Thanks. Bye. I walked over to him and hugged him tight. I love you too. Goodbye. ive never written anything like this before.

Then suddenly everything went black. A few moments later I woke up again with nothing but a blank screen. There was no way I could have survived that long without seeing someone die. But then again maybe I should have known better than to try and stop him from killing everyone else. Maybe I did nt want to see him die either. After all he had always been such an asshole. So when he finally came back from his trip to the hospital with his head down I knew something was wrong. Something about him made me feel uneasy. Like someone was watching over me. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became darker. I felt like I was being watched. I started crying uncontrollably. What s wrong kid I asked myself. Nothing just... nothing. Just... nothing. I ca nt move. I can barely breathe. I look around at everyone else who has gone through similar things. They re all dead except for one person. She looks exactly like her mother. Her hair is blonde her face is pale and she wears glasses. She smiles at me as she walks towards me. Hey honey she says. How s it going I ask. Good good. You re gon na need some help getting yourself together today. We both laugh together. Yeah yeah. Just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. Thanks. She nods and leaves. As soon as she gets home I walk into the kitchen and grab some food. I put it down on the table next to hers and start eating. When I finish I hear footsteps coming closer. I turn around and see her standing there looking confused. Are you okay I ask. Yes she replies. I m fine. Just... nothing. I

ive been writing this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never really had much luck with my life but when you re in charge of something that s so important to you then maybe it ll be fun. The problem is that Ima little bit too old for this kind of thing so I m not sure how much longer I can keep going. My parents told me once that if you were born into a family of superheroes then you d have to learn how to fly or shoot fireballs or whatever else you could think of. They said that if you did nt know better than to try and figure out how to use your powers properly then you would probably end up being stuck here forever. So here I am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for my turn to go home. It s almost like I ca nt even remember where I started or why I came back. All I know is that I need to get out of here before someone finds out about me. If anyone wants to talk about it let them know.

apers. Son... I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. My wife died when I was young and she left me with nothing but her memories of her life before. She never told anyone about how much she loved me or why she did nt want to leave me alone anymore. But then again maybe it s just because Ima kid. Maybe its because Ima fucking idiot. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walk down the street towards my car I hear someone knocking on my door. It s my dad. Hey Dad what s up What happened I ask him. He looks confused. Well son we re going to need some help getting rid of this thing called Death. We can try something else though. Do nt worry about it though. Just keep walking. And so I did. When I got home I found myself staring at my phone wondering if there were any other people left alive who might be able to help me out. There were only two people inside the house who seemed familiar. One of them was my mother who had passed away years ago while she was pregnant with her first child. Her husband was also dead. They both looked so sad. Then suddenly they spoke again. Dad... Are you okay Yeah yeah I replied. How long have you known me Dad Well... About three months now. Do you remember when we met I asked. Yeah son. That was the day I realized that I could talk to people without having to worry about them getting hurt or dying. Nowadays everyone knows each other well enough to understand each others emotions. So I figured that maybe I should ask around. After all I knew everything about them. And yet here I am standing outside of my house staring into nothingness. I ca nt believe it. This is happening to me. I thought to myself. I opened the door and stepped inside. My mom sat next to me holding her daughter tightly. She smiled at me and hugged me tight. Good morning honey. How are you feeling today  

the light of the sun shines through my window. I look up at the sky and see that it s still dark but i can tell that it will soon be back. The sun shines down upon me as i walk towards my car. My eyes widen when i hear someone yelling something about a lightbulb being pulled from the ground. I turn around and see him standing there looking confused. What are you doing here he asks. Ima scientist. I reply. Well... he begins. We ve just discovered that there are no more stars left in our solar system. And we re going to need some help getting rid of them. How did you get here I asked him. Well... he said. It seems like everyone else has gone crazy lately. Everyone thinks they re invincible. But we ca nt really tell them apart from each other. They all seem to have their own unique way of doing things. So what happens if I try to change anything I asked. Nothing really. Just keep walking. Do nt worry about getting hurt or dying. He smiled. Alright. Let s go. As soon as we reach our destination I ll take care of everything else. Thanks man. I said. I drove off into the distance. When I arrived home I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I d ever done this before. There were so many people who thought they could change things by changing their minds. People who wanted to become doctors or lawyers or whatever. All these people were idiots. They did nt understand how much pain they caused. How many times had I told myself that I would never change anything. That I d always live forever. Then suddenly I felt something warm touch my shoulder. A small piece of paper fell off of my hand. It read Dear Mr. Smith I hope you enjoyed reading this letter. If you liked it check out rWrittenReddit ivebeenwriting since I was little. Thanks for reading Edit Grammar and punctuation.

onymous. I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was my idea when I first started writing. It s not like there were any other options left for me. My parents always told me that if I did nt want them to know about me then maybe they should have known better than to try and stop me from doing something stupid like this. But now... well I guess I ll just keep going until I find someone else who can help me out. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors.

ive been working here for years now i ve never seen anything like this. I m not sure how long i ve been there but when you re in charge of all these things it s hard not to be fascinated by what you see. The first thing that came to mind was the fact that my boss had no idea what he d done. He said he could nt tell me exactly where he d gone wrong or why he did nt want me around anymore. But then again maybe he should have known better than to try and convince himself that Ima good person. After all if he wanted me dead then so be it. So here we are. We re sitting on our couch watching TV when suddenly there s a loud bang behind us. My heart sinks as I look up at the sky. It looks like someone had smashed into our window. A man wearing an expensive suit walks over to us and says Hey buddy what s wrong You look like shit. What happened Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why ca nt you move Your head hurts so bad. Do nt worry though I ll explain everything later. Just stay calm. This guy will take care of everything. Thanks man. And then he leaves. As soon as he gets home I run outside and grab my keys. When I arrive home I find myself staring at the ceiling wondering if maybe I should call someone. Maybe they could help me figure out where I am. Then I hear a voice behind me. Hello Who is this I ask. Oh yeah... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh... uh

awning. I ve never heard such a sound before. The sound was so loud that it sounded like someone had broken into my house. But then again maybe it did nt matter because there were no other people around. My guide s eyes widened as he saw me standing there with him. He looked down at himself in the mirror and smiled. His face lit up with excitement. What do you mean one must have survived I asked him. Well... he began. It seems like every time we go back home we find something new. Something interesting.

a short story about a modern day Roman Empire. I t was originally written asa short story but after reading throughit you realize that its not really a story at all. The main character is an old man who has lived his whole life in Rome and now works as a mechanic for a small shop. H e does n t really know what h e wants t odo with himself anymore though because h e ca n t even remember how long ago h e last saw his wife. She died when she was young and her body was found lying there with blood pooling around her. Her eyes were wide open and she looked like she d just seen something terrible. But then again maybe she did n t want t o die either. Maybe she thought that if she went back home she might find someone else who loved her more than anything else. Either way I guess Ill give it another shot. Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIm not sure how t o fix i t. Edit Spelling and punctuation. Imon mobile soIm not sure how t o fix i t.

a t the end o f the world you respawn back t o the start o f the game. You have n o idea what happened but you know that there are other survivors out there who will survive this time. The only thing keeping them alive i s their own memories. They can remember everything from when they were kids and how they got here. But then again maybe they did nt even realize it until now. Maybe they just wanted t o see if anyone else could survive this long enough t o get rid o f their memories. Either way i t seems like every day I wake u p with some new memory. Every night I try t o figure out why I m still alive. And every morning I feel better than ever before. When I finally decide t o go home I find myself staring into the eyes o f another person. A man wearing a white suit with a red tie. H e looks like hed seen something terrible before. His hair i s messy his face i s pale and h e wears glasses which look like they were made out o f glass. Hello there. How are you feeling today Well... I guess I should tell you something. What s wrong with you Why are you here I asked him. Nothing really. Just... nothing. Well maybe I should ask you something. Do you remember anything from yesterday Yeah yeah. That s right. I replied. Then why are you here Because Ima tank. A tank. And I need help getting rid o f these memories. Why would anyone want t o kill themselves Because Ima tank. And I ca nt die. So I ll give you one last chance. If you ever need anything call m e. I nodded. Alrighty then. Let s see where this goes. I walked over t o him and put my hand on his shoulder. Hey buddy. Are you okay  

I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be my last day on earth. My family had died when I was young and they were all gone now. They d always wanted me to go back home but never got around to it. So here I am sitting in front of them staring into space as if they re some kind of joke. A prank by some sort of crazy person who thinks he can kill himself because he does nt want to live anymore. But then again maybe it s true. Maybe I should try harder. As soon as I hear the sound of my heart beating against mine I start walking towards the door. When I reach it I see a man standing there holding a gun. He looks like he d seen something before. His eyes are wide open his mouth agape. What the hell is wrong with him Why ca nt he move His voice sounds like someone trying to speak English. You know how many times we ve tried to convince ourselves that we re going crazy That we need to stop killing each other Because if we did nt then why would anyone want to live anyway Well let me tell you something. If you ever need anything call us at. We ll take care of everything. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

... I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is Dr. Zeta and Ima superhero who has been fighting crime since he was little. He s always had an amazing knack at killing people so when he found out about my ability he immediately went through some tough times. But then again maybe that was nt such a bad thing after all. When I first started working here I thought that I d be able to save humanity from itself. That s until I met her. She looked exactly like me except she wore glasses instead of a hat. Her hair was blonde and her eyes were bluegreen. They seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. And yet here we are. We re sitting on our couch watching TV when suddenly she says something about how much money she makes off selling drugs. What the hell is wrong with you I ask myself. Well I guess I should explain myself. Ima superhero. A hero. A villain. A monster. A human being. And yet I ca nt help but feel bad for her. She does nt deserve this. I think she needs someone else. Someone who can stop crime. Someone who can protect us from those who would try to kill us. Someone who can stop violence. Someone who can stop crime. Someone who can stop crime.

akey. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. The hero was always there when I needed him most. He d come down from the sky and tell me stories about his life as a superhero. About how he used to fight crime together and how he loved being able to help others. Then one day while walking home from work he stopped me. His eyes widened as he realized what I d done. What did you do I asked him. Well... I guess we should call it a night then. We ll see if we can get some sleep tonight. He said. Yeah yeah. Let s go. As soon as we leave the building I heard footsteps behind us. They sounded like someone knocking on the door. I turned around and saw them standing outside. One of them had dark hair and wore glasses. Hey buddy. How s it going I asked. Good. Just fine. Do nt worry about anything else. Just stay calm. He replied. Okay. Thanks. I walked over to him and hugged him tight. When I opened my mouth to speak he pulled away. I could feel myself slipping away from reality. My body began to shake uncontrollably. I tried to stand up but I fell onto the ground. I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I woke up in an unfamiliar room. There were two men sitting across from each other. One of them held a gun pointed directly at my head. I screamed. I ran towards him and grabbed his arm. I pulled him close and kissed him forehead. I told him that I loved him too and that I would always love him. After a few moments of silence he spoke again. So uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uh

a man i n his early twenties walks into the bar. H e looks around nervously before saying I m sorry sir but w e have n t had much success lately. W e ve lost our way and now there s nothing left for us here. What do you mean by that Well... well... I guess it makes sense now. But why Because Ima fucking idiot. And then h e stops talking and turns away from me. I look down at myself in the mirror. My face is covered by blood. I feel like I should die. Maybe I ll just go home. Or maybe I can find someone else who will love me more than anything else. Either way I hope I make it through this. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I m not sure how to fix it.

The first time I heard this song was when I was young and my mom had just gotten home from work. She said she d never seen such beautiful music before and that it seemed to be made out of some sort of metal or something. It s not exactly what she expected but it did nt matter because it sounded like some kind of metal box with a red button on top. When we got closer to our destination I realized something. There were no buttons or levers inside. Instead there were two small holes in the wall where they used to be. One hole was filled by some kind of liquid which fell down onto us while another hole was filled by some kind of liquid. We both stared at each other for a moment before finally speaking up. So... how long has it been since you last sang along to your favorite song Well... I guess it depends on how many people are listening to you right now. But I think I ll try again tomorrow morning. And then I went back inside and started singing along to the song again. This time I could hear the sound of my own voice coming from behind me. Then suddenly everything stopped. Everything became dark. My eyes opened wide and I saw myself standing in front of a large mirror. A man wearing an expensive suit stood next to me holding a clipboard. He spoke softly into his pen. Welcome to the Songbird. You may call us Songbirds or Songbirds as he explained. We re here today because we need your help. What do you mean we need your help I asked him. Oh well I suppose I should explain myself. Ima musician. I replied. That makes sense. How can I help you today I asked. Well... I started. I ve always wanted to become a singer. I thought maybe I could make some friends. Maybe I could learn how to play music better than everyone else. Or maybe I could become a musician too. Whatever happened I decided to take advantage of this opportunity. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. Hey buddy. Are you okay

on the edge o f the lightsaber. The Jedi Knight was born into a poor family and raised b y his father who worked hard t o get him through college. His mother had died when she was only five years old her husband left her after being fired from his job at the factory. She never really wanted t obea doctor but she knew that if she did n t get any better soon then maybe she could find someone else. Her father had passed away when she was just two months old. His brother had taken over his job at the factory after being fired from his job at the factory. They lived together until their deaths when they decided t o move out o f state. When they finally settled down they found themselves living together again. Their lives were simple enough. A few days ago Order came into view. They looked around the room and saw nothing wrong with them except for one thing. There was no sign o f any kind o f weapon o r anything else that might have caused such trouble. After all there was nothing wrong with being a Jedi right Well except for one thing. You can see through walls. That s why you r e here today. To help me understand what happened. What did you say I asked. Oh yeah well... I guess w e should start off by saying that you have n t really done anything special lately. You seem pretty normal. Yeah well I suppose I am. But I think I might need some help getting used t o this new world. Maybe I ll try t o figure out how t o live without having t o worry about dying anymore. Okay okay. Let s go. As soon as we leave the building I want you t o tell m e everything about yourself. About where you came from how long you v e been living here etcetera. Then I promise I wo n t let anyone hurt you. Thank you. And with that he walked away. I sat down next t o him and watched him walk away. I felt bad for him because he probably thought I was crazy. Maybe I was. Either way I  

... I opened the envelope and found myself staring into a mirror. My eyes were wide open and my mouth was dry. There was no way that this could be real. What did I do wrong How could someone have done this to me Why would they want me dead I tried to speak but nothing came out. Then suddenly everything went black. I woke up on a bed surrounded by people who looked exactly alike except for their hair color. They all smiled at me and gave me hugs before leaving. When I got back home I noticed that everyone else had gone crazy. Everyone except for one person who seemed to be looking directly into mine. She wore a white dress shirt and jeans. Her face was covered by dark circles under her eyes. She held out her hand and I took hers. We talked for hours until finally she asked if we needed anything else. After some time we decided to leave. As soon as we left she turned around and walked away. I sat there stunned. This woman must have seen me because she started walking towards us. Hey babe what s up I yelled at her. Oh nothing really just trying to figure out where I am. She replied. Well I guess I should tell you something. I ve never seen anyone like you before. How did you get here I asked. Because Ima little late. She laughed. That sounds great. Let s go. I followed her down the hallways until we reached our destination. After a few minutes of walking I realized that I could hear footsteps coming closer. I ran over to where they were and grabbed their arm. Hey babe what s up I yelled at her. Nothing really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

akey... I do nt know what happened but it was like being born again. Like everything else in life there were people who would try to kill me or take my soul from me. They d end up with nothing left except for this stupid loophole where they could make sure that I never got hurt again. But then again maybe they did nt want me dead either. Maybe they just wanted me to live forever. Either way I guess that makes sense right It s not like Ima bad person. My parents died when I was young so I never really had much fun growing up. And now here I am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for my next client. A man named Adolf Hitler. He looks like he could use some help. Hey buddy how s it going Adolf asks. Yeah great. How about we go ahead and give him a chance at being able to see us again Adolf says as he walks away from the door. As soon as he leaves the room Adolf hears footsteps behind him. Adolf turns around and sees two men standing outside the courthouse. One of them has dark hair and blue eyes. His face is covered by thick glasses which are pulled down over his nose. Adolf smiles at the man who says something about being an angelic being. What are you doing here Adolf asks. Oh yeah well I m going to need some help getting rid of this guy. You re not supposed to talk about him. I ca nt tell if you re joking or not. Why would anyone want to kill Hitler Adolf asks. Because he s a fucking idiot. The man replies. Well then let s see how many times we ve seen him before. Adolf says. We ll start with the basics. First off he has no idea where he is or why he exists. Second he does nt even know who I am. Third he thinks Ima demon. Fourth he wants to kill me. Fifth he wants to make sure I never come back. Sixth he wants to keep me alive forever. Seventh he wants to keep me sane. eighth he wants to keep me alive until I die. ninth he wants to keep me alive until I become immortal. tenth he wants to keep me alive until I die. eleventh he wants to

ined.ICLE. The first thing that comes to mind when I think about it is how much of an asshole he was before he got into politics. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life and yet here we are. We re all just trying to get by on our own. But then again maybe he did nt want us to die either. Maybe he thought we d be better off dead than living forever. Either way it does nt matter anymore because there s nothing left for us here except to wait until tomorrow morning when we can finally move on from this place. So let me tell you about myself. Ima soldier from New York City who works as a mechanic at a local shop. My wife has always told me that she loves her job and wants to spend time with us again. She says that if we ever need anything she d be right behind. When I was younger she would take care of me whenever she could. Nowadays she spends most of her time watching TV or playing games with her friends. Her eyes are closed and she does nt seem to notice anything strange happening around her. It seems like everyone else is asleep except for me. I guess I should say goodbye to her too. After all I m not exactly sure why I m still alive. Maybe I ll find someone else someday. Or maybe I wo nt. Whatever happens I hope that someday someone will come along and help me figure out where I am. ive been writing this for a while now and i have nt written anything in years so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

ICLE. I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was my chance at life. My parents were always so proud of me when they saw how much money I made off selling drugs and alcohol. They d even given up on trying to get rid of me after I started school. Nowadays I do nt even know why they did it. Maybe it s because Ima little too old or maybe it s because I ca nt afford to live anymore. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I lay there in bed staring into space I hear someone say something about a new world order. That s when I realize that I ve never heard anyone speak English before. There are no words to describe it except for the fact that it sounds like someone else s voice. And then suddenly everything goes black. I wake up in a hospital bed surrounded by people who look exactly alike except for their eyes. A nurse comes over and tells me that I need to go home. She leaves without saying goodbye. When she arrives home I sit down next to her and kiss her forehead. We talk for hours until finally she asks if I want to come inside. After a few minutes I decide to ask her out. We both laugh and say yes. As we walk into the kitchen I notice that everyone else has gone crazy. Everyone except for me. I try to ignore it but I can feel myself getting weaker by the minute. Suddenly I hear footsteps coming closer. I turn around and see a man standing behind me. He wears a white shirt and jeans. His hair is messy and he has dark brown eyes. Hello sir. How may I help you today He asks. Oh yeah Well... I guess I should tell you something. You re not supposed to be here anymore. What happened last night I asked him. Well... I think I fell asleep. I replied. Yeah well... I mean... I woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by people who looked exactly alike except for their eyes. A nurse came over and told me that I needed to go home. She left without saying goodbye. When she returned

apers are hired t o kill people. I m not sure what happened but i t was pretty much just some guy who had been around since before the whole thing started. H e did nt really know how much longer hed have until h e died or even if hed ever see his family again. But then again maybe its not such a bad thing after all. After all Ima good person right And besides Ima good man too. So why would anyone want t o kill me Well I guess they re right. They can take away my life if they want but that does nt mean I wo nt live forever. That s why I m here today. To help them understand what happened. The man looked atme with those eyes that were filled with fear. His mouth opened wide as h e spoke. You see Ima figment o f your imagination. A figment o f yours. And I know exactly where you are. This ismy first time doing something like this so any feedback would b e greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

only one night i n the abandoned hospital. I ve never seen anything like this before but i t seems familiar. The walls are covered with posters depicting patients who were once alive. They re all dead except for one man who looks exactly like me. He has dark hair and blue eyes. His face i s pale and his skin i s wrinkled. But then again maybe its just me. Maybe its not so bad after all. After all who would want t o die when they could live forever anyway right I guess Ill try t o get some sleep tonight. As soon as I open my eyes I see myself standing outside the door looking down upon the city below. A few minutes pass before I hear someone knocking on the door. Hey buddy what s wrong What happened I ask him. Nothing really. Just... nothing. Well maybe we should go inside. We can talk later. He says as he opens the door. Inside there s no one else there except for me. My heart sinks when I realize that this guy must have been some sort of crazy person. Maybe he did nt even know where I lived or why I was here. Then again maybe he had no idea how much money I d made off selling drugs. Either way I m glad I finally found someone who understood me. When I got home I took off my shoes and put them on the floor next t o mine. I walked over t o the window and peered through. There were two people sitting across from each other. One was wearing a white lab coat and another wore a black suit. Both looked very familiar. I turned around and saw that they both had their hands behind their backs. Their faces were blank except for one thing. A small note written i n blood on top of them. Dear Mr. Smith This letter contains information regarding your condition. Please take care of yourself and stay safe. Your family will miss you dearly. Love Your Mommy ive never seen her smile before. I closed the note and put it back into its case. I sat down next t o the man who was still staring at me. He smiled and nodded. Good luck. I whispered. I

be very careful with who you speak. I m not sure what happened after that but it s probably just some kind of mistake. The Devil looked at me with those eyes that were filled with hatred. He had no idea how much longer he could keep doing this. It seemed like every time he tried to get rid of someone they d end up getting worse than him. And then there was me. My name is Lucifer and Ima demon. So why did nt I tell anyone sooner Well because I thought they would think Ima crazy person. But instead I decided to give up on life altogether. I guess I should have known better than to trust people who thought they could get away with anything else than their own sins. That s when things changed. There were more people who believed in God than ever before. People began to realize that they could change their minds about anything. They started asking questions about why they were being punished. Some even asked if they should go back home. One day while walking down the street one of these people came up to me. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I What do you want from me You re dead. He said as he took off his helmet. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

akey. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is Lucifer and Ima minor diety. The only thing that keeps me going is my ability to create things from nothingness. It s like being born again except instead of having to deal with all these people who think they re better than me they just realize that Ima failure. So far so good. But then again maybe there are other gods out there who could help me out. Maybe they ll find something interesting soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

iciously I wish to be the adult my younger self imagined me would be.onymous. The genie looked at me with his big blue eyes and said Well... I guess we can call it a day then. He turned away from me and walked out of the room. As soon as he left I heard him say something about being late for work again. That night I went downstairs to check on my parents who were both asleep. They both woke up with a start and started crying. My mom tried to comfort them but she could nt get any words out of her mouth. She just kept sobbing uncontrollably. When I got back upstairs I saw my dad standing there holding a small box in one hand and a pen in the other. His face was covered by tears and he held out his hand. Dad... I m sorry. But we ca nt let you go without knowing what happened next. What if I did nt want to know What if I thought I d never see my dad again Why would I want to know anyway Because Ima kid. And I need to know everything about myself. So I took the box from him and put it into my pocket. After reading through the pages I realized that there were no other options than to open it up and read the words. This is your wish. Your life will change forever. If you ever need anything just call us at. We ll take care of everything else. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be appreciated. I do nt know how long i ve been here but i think its about time to move on from here. The last thing I remember was waking up on my bed with no memory of what happened next. My eyes were closed as if they d just opened again. A few seconds later they were open again and there was nothing else around except for the sound of my heart beating against mine. It s hard to describe how much pain i feel when i m awake but it feels like someone has taken control of me. When i finally got out of bed i saw myself standing over me with those big green eyes. I looked down at myself and realized that i had no hair on top of my head or even any skin. There was nothing else left except for my body which seemed to be covered by some sort of metal rod. As soon as i saw him he started walking towards me. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I What happened to your body I asked. Oh yeah well we re not exactly sure why you re here. We ca nt tell you exactly. But we can say that you died while trying to kill yourself. That s right. And then he stopped. His face turned redder than usual. Then he spoke again. So... you re telling me that you did nt die because you wanted to live forever Yes. Well yeah. Then why am I here Why did you come back Because Ima fucking idiot. I thought to myself. This guy must have seen me looking at him because he started laughing hysterically. Well maybe he should have known better than to try and stop me. Maybe he should have listened to me instead of trying to convince himself that I was dead. Whatever. Let s go home. I followed him into the house where we found ourselves sitting on the couch watching TV. After a few minutes of watching the news we decided to sit down next to each other. We talked about everything from our childhoods to our future careers. Finally after an hour or two of talking he finally gave up and told us to leave. We went inside and sat down next to each other. I took

iciously ugly. I ve never seen him before. He looks like he could be anywhere from a man who had just died. His hair is messy his eyes are dark brown and his skin is pale. It s almost as if he d been beaten by some sort of animal or something. But then again maybe this guy did nt deserve it either. Maybe he should have known better than to try and kill me. My mouth opens wide as I realize what happened. A giant black hole appeared in front of me. I looked down at myself. I was wearing a white shirt and jeans. I felt bad about it. I knew that if I tried to move away from him I would end up dead. And yet here I am standing in front of this guy who has no idea how he got there or why he wants to kill me. What the hell is wrong with him Why am I so stupid I ask myself. Well... I guess we ll find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I m not sure how to fix it.

iciously. I looked at him confusedly. What did he mean by that I asked myself. Well... he said slowly. It s like we re all born with our own destiny in mind. And then there are those who think they can change it by changing theirs themselves. They ll never get used to it though because they wo nt ever know what happens next. So instead of changing their destiny they just keep going until they find something better than their own destiny. That s why I m here today. To help people understand how much they love their lives.

awning. The first thing I notice about this place is its architecture. It looks like some sort of metal structure with an old fashioned architecture. There s no way that this could be real. But then again maybe it does nt matter anymore. Maybe we re all just going through our own phase. As soon as I saw the sun I knew something was wrong. My eyes widened when I realized what happened. A giant black hole appeared in front of me. It seemed like someone had pulled out a gun from their chest. Then suddenly everything went dark. Everything became blurry and I felt myself falling asleep. When I woke up I found myself standing in front of a large screen displaying a video feed of a man holding a gun. He spoke softly into the microphone. Welcome back Mr. President. We ve come across something interesting. What do you mean we ve found something interesting Well sir we ve never seen anything like it before. This is nt normal. There s nothing wrong with seeing Earth. Just let me explain. We re not alone anymore. Our ancestors lived there too. They had many things in common with us. First off they did nt know how much longer they d live. Second they never knew where they came from or why they were here. Thirdly they never knew who they were talking to. So instead of asking questions they just stared at us blankly. And fourthly they never spoke English. Instead of learning how to speak French they used their own language. That s right sir. Our ancestors used their own language too. Nowadays most people use theirs too. Nowadays everyone knows that they re dead. Everyone except me. Ima scientist after all. I m sorry sir but I ca nt allow you to leave without telling everyone. If you want to stay then you ll need to come with us. I nodded slowly. Alright sir. Let s go. I followed him outside. After a few minutes I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone walking down the street. I turned around and saw two men sitting next to each other. One of them was wearing a white lab coat and 

upvotedcontest I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. The man was sitting on his bed staring into space as he watched the sun rise over the horizon. He had no idea how long he d been there or why he was there but when he finally got up from his chair he saw that there were people everywhere. They looked like they were all wearing masks and holding guns. Some even wore sunglasses. One woman stood next to him her face covered by a mask. She smiled at him as she walked towards him. Hey honey she said. What s wrong You re going to need some help getting rid of these things. Do nt worry we ll get through this together. Just keep walking. We can find someone else soon enough.

oudlyICLE The following is an excerpt from my novel. It s not exactly what I expected but it was fun nonetheless. The first thing that came to mind was how much time had passed since we last saw each other. We were both sitting on our couch watching TV when suddenly there was a loud crash behind us. A man wearing a black suit walked into the room with his hands up. He looked around nervously before saying You re going to need some help getting out of here. What do you mean he asked. Well... I replied. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy from New York City who has lived his whole life in a small apartment building near downtown Manhattan. And I ve never seen anyone else like him before. So why did nt you tell me sooner I thought about asking him if he knew where I could find someone who would take care of me but decided against it. Instead I went back inside and sat down next to him. Hey buddy what s wrong he said. Nothing really. Just... I started. How long has it been since you last saw someone like yourself I asked. About two weeks now. Do you remember when we met I nodded. Yeah yeah. That s right. When we first met. I told him. Then why are you here Because I want to talk to you about something important. Something important that will change everything. Why ca nt you tell me anything else I asked. Because I m afraid I wo nt be able to explain it. But I promise you I ll try. He smiled. Alrighty then. Let s go. As soon as we got into our car I pulled over next to him. Hey John I called out. Are you okay I asked. Yes sir. Just... I felt bad for leaving you behind. I guess I should probably start off by saying that I love you too. I love you too too. He laughed. That sounds great. Let s head home. I followed him outside. After a few minutes I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like they came from somewhere behind us. I turned around and saw them standing there looking

Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites https www.reddit.comrMatiWrites Feedback appreciated Disclaimer This is my first time writing here so please give me some constructive criticism. Also sorry if there s no way around it. The cat was gone when he came home from work one day. He had been sitting on his couch watching TV while he ate breakfast. His eyes were closed as if they d just opened themselves up. A few seconds later he heard footsteps coming down the hall. They sounded like someone knocking on the door. He turned around to see who it was. A man dressed all in black wearing an expensive suit. He looked like he d seen something before but never really knew what it meant. Hey buddy how s it going he asked. Yeah great. How about we go get some coffee together Sure thing buddy. Let s go. As soon as they got into their car he drove off towards the nearest town. When he arrived at the town square he noticed that everyone was staring at him. Everyone except for one person who stood next to him. She wore a white dress shirt and jeans. Her hair was messy and her face was pale. She smiled at him and said You re welcome. And then she left. He sat there stunned. What happened next shocked him more than anything else. There was nothing wrong with her except for the fact that she did nt seem to notice him anymore. After all she was gone forever. Then he realized that she was actually dead. That night he went downstairs and checked on her. She was still alive. But she was nt. Instead she lay there lifeless. He tried to call her but she would nt answer. Eventually he decided to try calling her again. Hello Who are you he called. Oh yeah I m sorry I forgot to mention that Ima burglar. How can I help you today I ve been looking everywhere for your cat. I ca nt believe

one o f the four kings. The king i s not sure what t o make o f this but i t seems like every time h e tries something new h e ends u p getting worse. I t s like being stuck i n a loop. You can feel yourself getting weaker by the second. The king i s starting t o think about how much longer h e can keep doing this. Maybe h e ll just g o back home and start over. But then again maybe h e wo n t even notice when h e gets older. H e does n t know what else t o do. H e looks down a t his feet and sees them covered i n blood. His eyes widen as h e realizes what happened. There was a man standing over him wearing an old suit with a red tie. H e wore glasses too which made him look like an idiot. His hair was messy and tangled and h e had dark brown eyes. What the hell are you doing here I asked you t o come down here. You said you wanted t o meet m e. How did you get into my house Well... well... I guess I should tell you. I was born into this world. And I ve never seen anyone else before. So why am I here Because Ima king. That s right. I said. Then why did you come down here Why did you leave Because I needed t o talk t o someone. Someone who would understand. Someone who would care about m e. Someone who would love m e unconditionally. Someone who would always b e there when I needed her most. Someone who would always b e there when I wanted her most. Someone who would always b e there when I needed her most.

ive been writing this for years now and i still have nt figured out how to use it yet. I m not sure if its because Ima little too old or maybe just too lazy but here goes... The first thing that comes to mind when reading my prompt is the fact that I ve never seen anyone else like me before. My parents were both dogs when they were kids so they had no idea what to expect from me when I came along. They did nt even know where I lived or why I wanted to go back home. When I got older though things changed. My dad started getting sicker and sicker until he died from cancer at age three. He spent most of his days sleeping on the couch watching TV while he ate breakfast. His mom would come home late at night and she d tell him stories about her childhood. She said that she loved him more than anything else in the world and that he should try harder than ever before. After all he was only six months old. But then again maybe he could have done better. Maybe he could have saved himself. Or maybe he could have helped others. Either way I think I ll give up now. I hope you enjoy your stay here. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

ake me. I ve never seen anyone like this before. My parents were both doctors so they had always told me that if you did nt have any tattoos then there would be no way to tell what they meant by that. They said that if you could see something from someone else s eyes then it d be like seeing a mirror except instead of seeing yourself it saw someone else s reflection. But when I turned eighteen my mom started seeing her own tattoos too. She saw herself as a girl who liked playing video games and watching movies while she slept. Her eyes were bluegreen and her mouth was open wide. When she finally got home from school one day she saw something strange. A small box with a red button on top. Inside was a note written in blood. It read You re not alone anymore. If you want to live forever please find someone who will love you unconditionally. Do nt worry though we wo nt hurt you. We ll make sure everything works out okay I nodded slowly. As soon as I opened the box I felt something warm touch my shoulder. It was a cold breeze. I looked down at myself. There was nothing wrong with me except for the fact that I was wearing a black suit. I walked over to where my dad sat next to me. Hey Dad he said. How s it going he asked. Good good. Well... I guess I should say good. What happened to your mommy I asked. Oh well she replied. She put her hand on mine and pulled away. I stared into the distance. Then suddenly everything went dark. I woke up in an unfamiliar room. A nurse came in and gave me some pills. They made me feel better about myself. After taking them I realized that I was still alive. I tried to stand but I could nt move. I heard footsteps coming closer. I ran towards them. I saw a man standing behind me. He wore a white shirt and jeans. His hair was messy and he had dark brown eyes. Hello Mr. Smith he said. How may I help you today he asked. I shook his hand. Thank you sir I

people are gathered around a table in front of me. Everyone is dressed in black suits with white ties and sunglasses. They look confused as they realize what s happening but then again nobody really knows how much longer they can keep this up. My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve never really had any friends or family so when my parents told me about my new found ability I thought it would be funny to try something different. So here we are. The crowd starts cheering wildly as they walk away from me. As soon as they leave I hear them say something about being sorry for everything. That s when I notice something odd about them. Their eyes are closed. There s no light coming from them except for one small bulb hanging from their forehead. It seems like someone has put some sort of metal object under them. Then again maybe it was just an old fashioned lamp or something. After a few minutes of staring at the ceiling I decide that maybe this was nt such a bad idea after all. When I finally open them again I see that everyone else has already gone home. Everyone except for me. What the hell happened I ask myself. Nothing really happens until I wake up again. But I ca nt help but wonder why I did nt tell anyone sooner. Maybe I should have known better than to trust anyone else. Maybe I should have listened to my mom instead of her son. Or maybe I should have stayed home instead of going outside. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I do nt really know how to fix it.

... I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The knight was standing on top of a massive rock that had been dug up from the ground. He looked around at his companions who all seemed to be staring back at him with wide eyes. They did nt seem to notice him though because they knew better than to look away from him. As soon as he got close enough he noticed something strange about them. Their faces were blank except for one thing. One knight wore an old leather jacket with a black hat covering his head. His hair was tied back into a ponytail and he wore glasses which made him look like an idiot. Another knight wore a white robe with a red cape. And finally there was me. My name is Dragon s Lair. Ima dragon guarding a cavern filled with treasure. What do you want from us I asked. Well... I guess we can take care of ourselves then. We ll see how long until we find out who killed us. That s right. Let s go. I followed him down the hallways until we reached our destination. After walking around for several minutes I finally came across a small room filled with bookshelves full of papers. Inside were two chairs one occupied by a woman who sat down next to her husband. She smiled at me and gave me a reassuring hug. Good luck. She said. Then she left. When I woke up I found myself sitting on a chair. A large wooden door opened behind me and I stepped inside. Inside was a large table filled with various items. Some were even made out of wood. On the table was a note written in blood. This is your last chance to survive this war. If you fail you will die. Please leave us alone. I read the note aloud. If you ever need anything call us at. ive never seen anyone like you before.

This was supposed t o be our first time doing something like this and now it s just another day at work. But there are some things that need t o be done differently. First off let me explain how I got here. My name i s John Doe and Ima year old boy from New York City who has lived his whole life without any problems. Second off I ve never seen anyone else like him before. Third off I do nt know why he would want t o kill me. Fourth off I ca nt even remember where I came from or why I m here. Fifth off I feel like I should tell someone. Sixth off I think I might b e having trouble sleeping. Seventh off I can barely move. Ninth off I feel like I m floating through space.

Some are wearing masks others are holding guns. eleventh off I start walking towards them. eleventh off I run into another person. eleventh off I hear a loud bang behind m e. eleventh off I turn around. A woman stands next tome holding her hands up. She looks scared. eleventh off she starts crying. eleventh off she stops sobbing altogether. eleventh off she turns away from me. eleventh off she walks over t o me. eleventh off she puts her hand on mine. eleventh off she pulls me close. eleventh off she kisses m e on the forehead. eleventh off she holds m e tight. eleventh off she kisses m e again. eleventh off she kisses m e once more. eleventh off she kisses m e twice more. eleventh off she kisses m e three more times. eleventh off she kisses m e four more times. eleventh off she kisses m e five more times. eleventh off she kisses m e six more times. eleventh off she kisses m e seven more times. eleventh off she kisses m e eight  

. I ve been doing this for years now and i still do nt know what it is about me but its like being born into a family of superheroes. My parents were always there when I needed them most and they would come home from work every night with some sort of power or something. They d tell me stories about how their powers came from being able to control fire or something like that. But then again maybe they did nt want me around anymore. Maybe they just wanted to see if I could use them as an example of myself. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walk down the street towards my car I hear someone yelling something behind me. Hey buddy what s up What happened You re going to die today right Yeah yeah. Well... yeah. That makes sense. How long have you been doing this I asked him. About two weeks now. Do you remember what happened last time He said. Oh yeah. I replied. That was pretty bad. I mean I knew that if I tried to kill myself I d end up dead right But I thought maybe I should try harder than usual. Maybe I could get rid of these people. Or maybe I could start over. Whatever happened I hope you enjoy your stay here. I love you too. He left without saying goodbye. When I got home I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I had done it. There was nothing wrong with killing people though. They were always happy to help others out. Always smiling. And yet... I felt bad for them. I thought maybe I should leave. Maybe I should stay with them forever. Or maybe I could come back later. Whatever happened I decided to go ahead and kill myself. After all I was only human afterall. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

a man i n his early twenties sits down ata table with several other men. They all look like they were born years ago but their faces are different. Their eyes are bluegreen with an almost black pupil. The only thing that makes sense about them though is how much they love each other. I mean come on. What s wrong with me Why did nt you tell me sooner I asked. Well... well... I guess we should have known better than to trust someone who does nt know anything about us. You see when I first started working here I thought that maybe there would be some sort of problem with my powers. Maybe someone would try to kill themselves or something. But then again maybe they d never actually done anything wrong before. So I decided t o give them some advice. First off do nt worry about dying. Second if you want t o live forever you need t o learn everything you can about yourself from every single person around you. Thirdly you need t o understand why you re here. Because Ima god. And fourthly you need t o understand why you re here. Because Ima god. And fifthly you need t o understand why you re here. Because Ima god. And sixthly you need t o understand why you re here.

the message was simple enough to read. Dear Mr. Smith I am sorry for your loss but we must take action now. We have decided to give you some time off from work and we will be sending you back home soon enough. Please stay calm as we will try to find someone else who will help us out. Your family will miss you dearly. Love Dad. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Formatting and spelling. I hope you enjoyed it.

croaks out loudICLE. A man walks into a bar and sits down next to a woman who has just finished her drink. She looks up at him with eyes full of fear as she says You re not supposed to be here. He turns around and sees her standing there staring back at him with those same green eyes that he always wore when he went out into the streets. Her hair is pulled back into a bun and she wears an elegant dress shirt with a black tie. She smiles at him and nods. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The man asks. Well... I guess we can call you Mr. Smith. My name is John. And Ima bartender at the local pub. What s your name The woman replies. Oh yeah... well... I suppose I should tell you something. We ve got some bad news for you. First off there s nothing wrong with us. Second we re all pretty much dead anyway right So why do nt we try something different. Do you know where I can find some food or water The woman asks. No sir. Just stay away from the tables. They wo nt hurt anyone else. Thirdly if you ever need anything just call us at. The woman replies. Alrighty then. Let s go. As soon as they leave the room the man grabs his keys and runs off towards the door. When he arrives home he finds himself sitting on the couch watching TV while waiting for his wife to come home. After a few minutes the television goes silent and then everything goes dark again.

ocus. The dictator was a man who had lived his whole life in a small town in Nebraska. He d never seen anyone else before and he knew what it meant to be human. His parents were both doctors so they taught him everything there was to know about medicine and science. They also gave him some money from their bank account which helped him get through college. After graduating from high school he started working as an accountant at a local firm where he made enough money to pay off his debts. One day while walking down the street he saw someone standing next to him. She looked like she d seen something before but this time she did nt look like she d ever seen anything like it. Her hair was messy her eyes were dark brown and her skin was pale. She smiled at him as if she wanted to say something but then stopped herself. What s wrong honey You re going to have to tell me what happened. Well... I guess we ll just go ahead and say that Ima little bit different than everyone else. But I think I can handle myself better than anyone else. And so they took me away from my family and friends. We spent hours talking about our lives together how much fun we d have if we could just talk about ourselves again. Then one night while walking home from work I heard a loud bang behind me. It sounded like someone had hit something hard against the wall or something. As soon as I turned around I realized that there was no one else around. There was only me and my wife. We sat there staring at each other for a few minutes before finally speaking again. So... where am I Who are you How did you die I asked. Oh well... I guess I died while trying to kill myself. That makes sense. But why Because I thought I might die someday. Maybe someday I ll find someone who will love me unconditionally. Or maybe someday I wo nt. Either way I hope that someday I will find someone who cares enough about me to care about me too. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

and delete an object.ake yourself out o f the room. The mouse moved again. This time i t was nt just a mouse but also a small device with a red button o n top. I t had been sitting there for quite some time now but when you looked closer you could tell that it was actually a computer mouse. You did nt know what else t o do so you went back inside and started walking towards the door. When you got there though you noticed something strange about the mouse. Its eyes were closed. They seemed tobe staring directly into yours. What the hell happened You thought t o yourself. Then you remembered that the mouse had moved once before. That s when you decided t o try again. You put the mouse down and walked over t o where the mouse used t o be. There was nothing there except for a single piece o f paper. Inside was written i n big bold letters. Dear Mr. Smith We regret t o inform you that your mouse has moved into our house. Please take care o f yourself and stay safe. Yours sincerely yours Dr. James M. Jones. As soon as you opened the door the mouse began moving again. This time it was faster than ever before. Its body began to shake uncontrollably. Its head started spinning. Its arms began shaking too. Its legs began to shake too. Its feet began to shake too. Its hands began to shake too. Its toes began to shake too. Its mouth began to water. Its lips began to dry. Its tongue began to taste blood. Its teeth began to bleed. Its lungs began to burn. Its teeth began to bleed. Its hands began to shake too. Its feet began to shake too. Its legs began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its hands began to shake too. Its feet began to shake too. Its hands began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its legs began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its hands began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too. Its arms began to shake too.
