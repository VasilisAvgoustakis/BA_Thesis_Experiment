Edit Grammar and punctuation. I do nt know why they did nt just give us a few more lines of dialogue instead of all those lines being taken from each other.

iciously. The teacher looked at him with wide eyes and said You know what this means right Well... yeah but how did you get here I asked. He shrugged. It s like being born into an orphanage where everyone has no parents or siblings. And then there was this one guy who had his whole life ahead of him. So he decided to make some friends. We went through all sorts of things together before we got here. First off he started by making sure everyone knew exactly where they were going. Second he made sure that nobody ever saw them again. Third he made sure that everyone could see each other without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of joke. Finally after several weeks of trying he finally managed to find someone who understood him better than anyone else. She was beautiful. Her hair was blonde her skin was pale and she wore an elegant dress shirt and jeans. She smiled as she walked towards me. Hi honey. How are you doing today I asked. Good. She replied. Are you okay Yeah. Just tired. Do nt worry though. I ll take care of myself later. Thanks. She left without saying goodbye. As soon as she came back I felt something warm touch my shoulder. My heart skipped a beat when I saw her face. It was her smile. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. There was nothing left except for the light shining through the window above us. A small smile crept across my face. Hey babe. What happened I asked. Oh nothing really. Just... just stay calm. She nodded. Okay. Let s go home. I followed her outside. When we arrived at our house I noticed that there was no sign of anyone inside. There was only a single door leading down. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pens. On each shelf sat a single sheet of paper. Each page contained a picture of me and my wife. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

awning. The first thing I notice is how dark this room looks. It s almost as if someone had put some sort of lightbulb on it but there are no lights around. There are only two things that can be seen from here. One is the darkness surrounding me and another is the faint glow of my own eyesight. My head hurts so bad that I ca nt move much more than my knees. Then again maybe this is just some kind of joke. Maybe I should try calling home instead of going back into space. But then again who would want to go back into space anyway right Well at least we re not stuck here forever. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

The first thing I noticed was how much money had been made off selling drugs. It seemed like every time someone tried to sell me something they d end up with more than enough money to pay off their debts. But then again maybe it s just because Ima superhero after all. After all if there are no heroes around then why should we care about them anyway We re not even supposed to know what happens when you die. So here I am sitting at home watching TV while waiting for my turn to use my powers. My eyes widen as I realize what I ve done. A few minutes pass before I hear footsteps coming down the hallways. They sound like they came from somewhere else. Then suddenly everything goes black. I look up at the sky and see that there are clouds above us. There are trees everywhere and there are people walking towards me. Some of them even seem to be wearing masks. One guy has a gun pointed directly at my head while another holds out his hand. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty bad today. What happened Well... uhm... I started off pretty good. I got ta go now. Do nt worry though I ll get you some food soon enough. Thanks man. Let s head back. As we walk away from the city I feel something warm touch my shoulder. I turn around and see a woman standing next to me. She looks familiar but she does nt seem to recognize me. Her face is covered by dark circles under her eyes. Hello there. How may I help you today She asks. Oh yeah I replied. I guess I forgot to mention that I m sorry about your accident. That s okay though. Just stay calm. I nod. Okay. Let s talk about this later. She leads us through the streets until we reach our destination. When we arrive at the airport I take off my helmet and put it on. I open the gate and step inside. Inside is a large room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor is a video feed showing images of various countries. Each image shows a picture of me holding a bag full of money. In front of

... I ve never seen anything like it before. The first time I saw her she was sitting on my bed watching TV while reading some books. She looked so happy when she smiled at me that I could nt help but feel bad for her. But then again maybe it s just because Ima little bit older than her. Maybe it s because I m not used to seeing people who look exactly alike anymore. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I sat there staring into space I heard someone say something about an old man being able to see through walls. That night we went outside and played with each other until our eyes closed. When we opened them again she was gone. My heart sank as I realized what happened next. There were two men standing behind us holding guns. One of them pulled out his phone and started dialing numbers. Hello This is your new friend Mr. Smith. How may I help you today Well sir we re having trouble finding someone who can accept us as friends. We need to talk about something else. What do you mean Sir we ca nt afford any more people coming in here. Please let me know if you want anything else. Thanks sir. And then he hung up. I stared at him blankly. Then I noticed something strange. His face was pale and his hair was messy. It seemed like he d been crying since he left. Hey buddy how s it going I asked. Good good. Just fine. Let s go home. I walked over to the door and knocked twice. Nothing came out. After several minutes of waiting I finally got a response. Hello This is your new friend Mr. Smith. How may I help you today Well sir we ca nt afford any more people coming in here. Please let me know if you want anything else. Thanks sir. And then he hung up. I stared at him blankly. Then I noticed something odd. His face was pale and his hair was messy. It seemed like he d been crying since he left. Hey buddy how s it going I asked. Good good. Just fine. Let s go home. I walked over to the door and knocked twice. Nothing came out. After several minutes of waiting  

tellus the faults o f your kind. I n the past you used t o be able t o communicate with each other through radio waves but now you can only use these devices for communication. You have become too advanced for your own good. The aliens looked at each other confusedly then said Well maybe if they d known better than t o try and stop u p here they would have done something different. Maybe they should ve stayed home instead o f going back into space. But no matter how hard they tried they could never get rid o f their own problems. They had always wanted t obea planet where everything worked together perfectly. Nowadays however there are many things that make them special. For example when they first arrived on Earth they thought that there was nothing wrong with them. That s until they realized that they could communicate with each other using their own technology. This made sense because they knew exactly what happened next. When they finally figured out how t o use this technology they started sending messages back home. One day one o f these messages came acrossa picture o fa girl wearing her hair down. She smiled and waved goodbye before walking away. Another message read Dear Mr. President I am sorry t o inform you that your country has lost its way. Your government will cease operations immediately. Please take care o f yourself and stay safe. Love Yours sincerely Mr. President. ive been working tirelessly t o find someone who can help m e out. Any feedback would b e greatly appreciated.

get back i n time. The mirror showed m e reflection but notmy reflection.ikers are the people who interpret this. They say that if you look into a mirror then there s nothing wrong with looking back at yourself but when you try t o change something about yourself it seems like every time I look into a mirror I end up staring back at myself. This is why I ve never seen anyone else before. When I first started working here I thought that maybe I should just leave. Maybe I could find someone who would love me unconditionally. But after seeing all these people around me I realized that they did nt care about anything anymore. All they wanted was to live forever. So instead of staying home and watching TV or playing games with each other I decided t o take advantage o f their generosity. After all Ima wizard right And so I went home. As soon as I got inside I noticed that the mirror was still there. That s odd because i t seemed like every time I looked into it it showed me exactly where I d been standing since I woke u p. Then I saw it again. A small box with a note written i n big bold letters on top. I openeditup and read the words Welcome t o your new life. ive never seen anyone like you before. I closed the lid and put the glass down. I walked over t o the mirror and stared into its reflection. There were no markings whatsoever except for one thing. A single word written i n big bold letters on top. I turned away from the mirror and headed towards the door. I knocked twice and waited until the sound stopped. Nothing happened. I tried calling my parents but they would nt answer. Finally after several minutes I finally managed t o call my sister who answered the phone. Hey honey she said. Are you okay Yeah I replied. How long have you been gone I asked. About two weeks now she answered. Well... I guess we can call each other later. We sat down next t o each other and talked about our lives together. About how much fun we had playing video games and watching movies together  

overed in ancient man s blood. I ve been here before i think its time for me to go home. The crowd cheered as they watched him walk away from them. They were all so excited about what he d done that they did nt even bother asking why he had gone back in time. It seemed like such an easy decision but then again maybe it was just my imagination. After all if there are no more gods than us then maybe we should get rid of them altogether. As soon as he left the room he turned around and walked towards the door. When he opened it he saw me standing there looking down on him. What do you want from us I asked. Well... I guess we can give you some advice. You re going to need some help getting used to this place. We ll try our best to teach you everything there is to know about science and technology. And if you ever feel scared or confused call us at.omesICLE. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

apers. The crowd roared as they cheered on me. I could nt help but notice how much more interesting this was than my previous life. My parents had always told me that if you were going to be an engineer then maybe you should try something different. Maybe you could make things better for yourself or maybe you could change your mind about being born into poverty. But no matter what happened I knew exactly where I wanted to go next. As soon as I stepped outside I felt something warm touch my shoulder. It was a small girl wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. She looked up at me with those eyes that made you want to cry. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she wore glasses which were slightly crooked. What s wrong honey she asked. Nothing just... I replied. Well we re not sure why you came here today. We ve got some questions for you. How did you get here Why are you here I asked. Because Ima scientist. And I need answers. Do you know where I can find some more information about our universe I nodded slowly. Yeah yeah. That sounds great. Let s see how long until we figure out what happens when someone finds out about us. Then let s go home. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

ake yourself out of bed. The doorbell rang as I opened it. My heart sank into my stomach when I saw her standing there with her arms crossed over her chest looking down on me with those eyes that were always full of hope. She smiled back at me and said You re welcome honey. We ll get started soon enough. As we walked towards our kitchen she turned around and started walking away from us. When we reached the bottom floor she grabbed my hand and led us inside. There was no way that this could be real. It s not even close to being an ordinary house. But then again maybe it was nt so bad after all. After all if there are people who can make things like this work then they should probably know how much money they make off selling them. So here I am sitting in front of my computer trying to figure out what to do next. What if I just give up on life altogether Maybe I can find someone else who will take care of me. Or maybe I can finally move on from this place. Either way I m pretty sure that I ca nt afford any more food than usual today. As we entered the living room I noticed something odd about her face. Her hair was messy and tangled and her clothes were torn apart. What the hell happened Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why are you doing this I asked myself. Well... I guess I should explain. Ima scientist. And I ve never seen anyone like you before. She replied. Oh yeah Yeah well I mean I thought you might want to come inside. Do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone. Just stay calm. I told her. Okay. Let s head upstairs. I followed her down the stairs until we came across a small room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pictures. Inside was a table where I found one titled Level. I picked it up and read the words Welcome to Level. ive been working on this for years now. I ve never seen anything like it. I ve never seen anything like it. I ve never seen anything like it. I ve never seen anything like it. I ve never seen anything like it. I ve never seen anything like 

I m sorry but this is nt what I expected. This was supposed to be my last chance at life. My family had died when they were young and now here I am standing before them with nothing but my own corpse. The only thing keeping me sane is that I ve never seen anyone else die before me. It s like watching someone who has just gone through hell and back again. But then again maybe it does nt matter anymore because there are no more people left alive than there used to be. Maybe we ll all end up dead anyway right So why do nt we try something different. What if we went back home and got some food from the fridge Or maybe we could go outside and play some games together. Either way I hope you enjoy your stay here. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

the stranger said. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be my first time writing here so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. The stranger looked at me with those eyes that were filled with sadness and fear. He had dark hair that fell down over his shoulders and he wore glasses which made him look like an old man. His face was covered by thick black sunglasses which hid most of his features from view. What do you mean by that I asked him. Well... he began. It seems like we ve been friends since childhood. We used to play tag together once every week. Nowadays we re just playing video games together. And then there was this one guy who came up to us and told us that he d seen us before. That night he went home and slept soundly. When he woke up he found himself staring into space. There were stars everywhere and they seemed to glow brighter than ever before. Then suddenly everything stopped glowing altogether. Everything became blurry and I felt myself falling asleep again. As soon as I opened my eyes again I realized that I could see nothing but darkness. My mind raced through possibilities. Was this some sort of joke Did someone really think that they would get away with killing themselves because they knew how much pain they caused others Or maybe they just wanted to make sure that nobody ever saw them again. Either way I decided to try to figure out why I did nt wake up sooner. After several minutes of searching around for hours I finally managed to find a door leading outside. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pictures. On each shelf sat a single sheet of paper. Each page contained a picture of me and my family. My mother and father were smiling while my brother was holding hands. They both smiled back at me as they read through them. One picture showed us sitting on our porch watching TV while another showed us playing games. All these photos made sense now.

rea little different from what I was doing but here goes... The first time I saw her she looked like a girl who d been born with blonde hair and blue eyes. She wore an elegant dress that hugged her curves perfectly and had dark brown skin that shone through the light of the sun. Her lips were slightly crooked as if they wanted t o speak but she did nt seem t o care much for speaking. When we got closer t o our destination I realized something was wrong. There was nothing else left for m e t o say except that I loved her. And then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIdont really know how t o fix i t.

apers. Son I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. My wife died when she was young and my son has never seen her like this before. He s always been so scared of death and he does nt know how much longer we can keep doing it. But then again maybe if he d known better than to try it himself he would ve done something different instead of just going through life without knowing where he was going or why he needed help. Maybe he ll find someone else soon enough. And maybe they wo nt even notice me anymore. So here goes nothing. The first thing I noticed was how quiet it sounded outside my room. It seemed like everyone else had gone home except for me. There were no windows or doors leading into any other rooms. No furniture either. Just empty space. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became brighter and clearer. Everything looked like it belonged there. When I opened my eyes I saw myself standing next to a man wearing a white lab coat. His face was covered by dark circles under his eyes. What do you want from me sir asked the doctor. Well... I guess I should say goodbye then. I replied. As soon as I got out of bed I ran over to him and hugged him tight. We kissed passionately until he fell asleep. That night after dinner I decided to go check on my son. As I walked down the hall towards the kitchen I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on the door. I turned around and saw my son sitting on the couch watching TV. Hey buddy what s wrong I called out. Nothing really. Just... just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. Just relax. Okay. Let s get started. I grabbed my keys and headed toward the bathroom. As I entered the shower I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I tried to stand up but I could nt move. Suddenly I heard a loud thud coming from behind me. I jumped backwards and fell onto the floor. I woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors and nurses. A nurse came running over and gave me

It s been years since I ve seen her again. She was always so beautiful and kind but now she just seems like an idiot. Her hair is messy and tangled and her eyes are dark brown. They look like they ve been washed away by water or something. But then again maybe it does nt matter anymore because she wo nt ever see me again. Maybe she ll never hear about me either.

omes. I ve been doing this for years now and i still do nt know what it was about me but I had to try something new. It s not like Ima bad person or anything. Just... different from everyone else. My parents were both doctors so they knew how much money they could make off selling drugs. They also taught me how to use my powers properly so that when I got older my dad would take care of me while he went home from work every night. He d give me some money if he could get rid of me before he died. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become an engineer. After graduating high school I started working at a small company called Apple. We made computers that could run Windows and Android. Then one day we came across something interesting. A computer chip which looked like a piece of paper. Inside were two words written in big bold letters. You re going to die today. What the hell happened I asked myself as I stared at them. Well... I guess we should say goodbye then. As soon as I opened the door to my room I saw him standing there looking confused. His eyes widened as he realized that he did nt see anyone else anywhere. Then suddenly he spoke again. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today I m sorry sir but your wife has passed away. She died yesterday morning. That s right. And why would she die Because she was diagnosed with cancer. Her body went limp after hours of treatment. So we took her away from us. Nowadays everyone lives their whole life without seeing another human being again. But I still feel bad about leaving her alone. Maybe someday someone will come along and tell me that she loves me too much to leave her side. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I hope that someday someone will find out about us. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

rICLE. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be a simple job. A small device that would allow people to travel through time without having to worry about getting caught u p or dying again. But when you re traveling through space with nothing but your own mind and body there s no way around it. You can only go so far before someone finds out about you. And then they ll never know who you really are or where you came from. That s why we need you. We need you to help us figure out how to stop these monsters from coming back. If you do nt want to die then maybe you should try something else. Maybe you could just leave. Or maybe you could stay here forever. Either way it does nt matter anymore. All that matters is that you re safe. That s right. Now let s get started. As soon as we ve finished our work on the device we ll send you off to live your life again. If you ever need anything call me at.

the first time I saw her. She was beautiful and smart and kind but she had no personality whatsoever. Her hair fell down over her shoulders as if it were made out of gold. It looked like it belonged there but it did nt. Instead of being a princess it became an animal. A beast that would eat anyone who tried to get close enough to touch it. When I got older my parents started asking questions about why I could see things from their own eyes. They said that I should try seeing them through others eyes because they d think I was crazy. That s how I met her. We spent hours talking about our lives together about everything from our childhoods to our future careers. After some time we decided to move away from each other. My mom told me that she loved me too much to leave her side. She also said that I needed to learn more about myself before I could go back home. So here I am sitting in front of my computer staring into space wondering what happens next. What do you want to know about me I asked. Well... she began. You re not really human anymore are you I replied. No she laughed. Then why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward without having to worry about getting killed by someone else I shrugged. Because Ima dragon. And I m not going anywhere anytime soon. I ll just stay here until I find someone who will take care of me. Okay she smiled again. Let s start with the basics. First off I need to know where I am. Second I need to know how long I ve been alive. Third I need to know if I can survive without food or water. Fourth I need to know if I have any friends or family members left. Fifth I need to know if I ever meet anyone else. Sixth I need to know if I ever feel anything. Seventh I need to know if I ever feel anything. Eighth I need to know if I ever feel anything. Ninth I need to know if I ever feel anything. Tenth I need to know if I ever feel anything. eleventh I  

ive been writing this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never written anything before but when you re writing something like this... well it s just too much work. The first few paragraphs were pretty good. But then they got more and more boring until one day someone decided that they wanted to see how many people would read them. That night we went through some pretty rough times together. We had no idea where we d end up or even if there was any way out. And then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing over me with his arms crossed. He looked like he d seen something else than himself before. His eyes were wide open and his mouth opened slightly as if he was trying to speak. What are you doing here I asked him. You re supposed to be dead right now. Well yeah. But why Because Ima fucking idiot. So what happened next shocked me. There were two men sitting across from each other holding guns. One of them pulled out a pistol and shot the other in the head. Both fell to the ground unconscious. As soon as they woke up the man who had died turned around and walked away. When he came back into view he smiled at me. Hey buddy. How s it going. Yeah great. Let s go home. We ll talk later. Thanks. Bye bye. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I m not sure how to fix it. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

awning. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be my last chance at life and now here we are. The man looked at me with those eyes that were filled with sadness. He had no idea how much longer he d live or even if it would ever happen again. His face lit up as he realized what happened. It s okay son. We ll get through this together. Just remember that we re all going to die eventually right Well maybe not today. Maybe tomorrow morning. But then again maybe not ever after either. So why did nt you tell us sooner Because Ima coward. A monster. And yet... I guess it makes sense. There are people who think they can change things by killing themselves off. They ca nt really blame them though. Everyone knows how hard it is to kill someone when everyone else has done it before. When I first met him he told me stories about his past lives where he used to play video games all night long. Nowadays he spends most of his time playing video games alone. That s why I decided to take advantage of his gift. To make sure everyone knew exactly where they should go next. After all if anyone wanted to live forever they needed to find someone else. Someone who would love them unconditionally. Someone who would always care about them. Someone who would always protect them from harm. Someone who would always give up everything for them. Then suddenly he stopped talking altogether. Instead he stared into space. A few seconds later he turned around and walked away. As soon as he left I heard footsteps behind me. I ran towards him and jumped off the roof. My heart sank. What the hell happened Where am I Who are these people Why am I here I tried to scream but nothing came out. I felt like I was falling apart. Suddenly I heard someone yelling something about a bomb. I quickly grabbed my phone and called the police. They arrived shortly after and took me away. When I got home I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I even bothered asking questions. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback

the user is an old man with dark hair and blue eyes. He wears glasses which look like they ve been worn out by years of use. His face is covered in scars from when he used them all up. The only thing that can be seen from him are his teeth which are crooked and he does nt seem to have any teeth at all. They re also very thin so there s no way for them to fit together properly. But then again maybe this guy did nt know what he wanted to do with himself after all. So here we go. My name is John Smith and Ima wizard. And I m going to tell you about myself. You see John Smith has always had an affinity for magic. It was born into his family when he was young. His parents were both wizards and they grew up together. When they turned eighteen John went to college where he studied law. After graduating from high school he started working as a lawyer at a local firm. As soon as he got into work he met someone named Mary Jane. She told him about her husband who worked as a mechanic. They spent most of their time together playing video games and watching movies. One day while walking down the street John saw something strange. A small box on top of which sat a woman wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. Inside was a note written in blood. John opened the box and read the words Welcome back John Smith. This is your new home. Your new life. You ll find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

astyour tank i s still alive but its not. I m sorry if this is nt what you were looking for but here goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much fun it would be if everyone else had died before me. But then again maybe they did nt even know who I am yet. Maybe they just wanted to see if there was anything else I could do about it. So instead of trying to kill themselves off I decided to try something different. When I woke up I found myself sitting on my bed staring into space. There were no stars or planets around me except for one small hole where my head used to be. It looked like someone had taken off my helmet and put it on. As soon as I opened my eyes I saw that there was nothing else left except for darkness. Then suddenly everything went black. My body began to shake uncontrollably. I tried to move my arms but they were stuck together. I felt as though I was floating through space. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on my door. I ran over to where they were standing and grabbed their hands. We both stared at each other for a moment before finally speaking. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today Well sir we ve got some bad news for you. What happened last night Well sir we re going to need your help getting rid of these monsters. They seem to have taken over our area. That s right sir. And why would they want us dead Because Ima tank. A tank. And I ca nt die. So please let me tell you something. If you ever feel sick or injured please call us at. Thank you sir. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I m sorry but this is nt what you wanted. You re dead. And then there was silence. The only sound that could be heard were the faint hum of the wind blowing through his hair. He looked around at all of those people who had died before him. They were all gone except for one man who stood up from his chair and walked over to where he sat. His eyes widened as he saw them. A woman wearing a white dress stood next to him. She wore glasses which she held out towards him. Her face was covered by dark circles under her eyes. Her mouth opened slightly as if she d seen something terrible. What do you want from me I asked. Well... she said slowly. Ima little confused about how much time has passed since we last spoke. How long have you been alive I mean I ve never really known anyone else before so maybe it s just because I ca nt remember anything else. But I think I ll go ahead and tell you everything now. My name is John Smith. Ima year old boy living in New York City. I work at a local coffee shop. I live alone. I have no friends or family. I do nt even know how to talk. So why am I here Why did you come back I thought you would be able to help me out. I told you I needed some help getting rid of these monsters. That I wanted to make sure everyone knew exactly where they were going. Then why did you leave Because I wanted to see if anyone else would ever come back. If nobody came back then I d probably end up like them. I guess I should explain myself. When I first met you I thought you were crazy. Then I realized that you were actually pretty smart. You learned everything there was to know about computers and programming. You also became very talented at making weapons. And now you re finally ready to start using them against others. I nodded. Yeah well let s get started. We went through some rough times lately. There were many battles between us and each other. Some even got killed by 

. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is Captain America and Ima superhero. And Ima good one at that. It s just that my powers are nt exactly what they used to be either. They d always been so much more powerful than me before. But now... well maybe they did nt want to be around anymore. Maybe they thought I was crazy or something. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walk into the room I see my nemesis standing there with his arms crossed over his chest. He looks like he has nt slept in days. His eyes are wide open and his mouth opens slightly as if he wants to speak. Hey buddy how s it going I ask him. Yeah great. How about we go get some coffee together sometime Sure thing man. Let s head down to the bar. We both sit down next to each other and start talking about our lives together. About everything from our childhoods to our future careers. Then suddenly he stops talking altogether. What happened last night Well... well... I started off pretty normal. I went home after school got dressed up and headed towards the door. When I came back inside I noticed that everyone else seemed to be asleep except for me. That s weird. Why would anyone wake themselves up early Because they re afraid of being caught. So I decided to take a nap. After a few minutes I heard footsteps coming closer. I turned around and saw two men walking toward me. One wore an expensive suit and tie while the other carried a large bag full of money. Both had guns pointed directly at me. Hey buddy what s wrong I asked. Nothing really. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. Oh yeah Yeah well... I guess I should tell you something. If you ever need anything call us. We can help you figure things out together. Thanks. I nodded slowly. Alrighty then. Let s go. I followed him outside. There was no way I could escape this place without getting killed. Eventually we reached the front door where  

ake i n front o fa god who tells you that h e has never seen anyone like you before. H e also says that there are many things about him that make him feel like he should be dead but instead h e s sitting there staring into space. The first thing I notice when I look around m y room is the lack o f lights. There are n o windows either only a single lightbulb hanging froma ceiling above m e. M y eyes widen as I realize how long ago this had been. When did this happen How could someone possibly know about me What happened t omy family How could they possibly understand why I would want t obea ghost Why did they think Ima monster Because Ima fucking idiot. And then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I do nt really know how t o fix i t. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

ikers are nt real. I m not sure what happened but i think it was some kind of mistake. The doctors told me that if i did nt get rid of my body then they would take care of everything else. That s why i got here. To help people understand how much pain they re in. And so far i ve done nothing. My head hurts like hell and my heart rate is increasing rapidly. It feels like someone has taken control of me. I ca nt move or speak or anything else. All i can do is stare at the ceiling wondering where i am. What if there s no one left behind Why did they leave me alone How could they possibly know about me I guess i ll just wait until tomorrow morning when they come back. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

the following is an excerpt from my book The Book of Life. It was written by God Himself and he had been around since before anyone could even remember him. He wrote it down on his clipboard and then put it into his mouth. When he finished speaking he looked up at me with those eyes that were filled with hatred. What do you mean by that I asked. Well... I guess we should call you God. That s right God. And what does that even mean I replied. Oh well then let s get started. God said as he walked away from me. As soon as he left I heard footsteps behind me. They sounded like they came from somewhere else. Then suddenly everything went black. My vision blurred and I felt myself falling asleep. After about minutes of waking up I realized that there were no lights anywhere else except for the moonlight shining through the window above us. There was nothing else to see except for the stars above us. So I decided to go check out the sky. As I approached the edge of the planet I noticed something odd. A small hole appeared in the ground where the moon used to be. This caused me to jump back into reality. I tried to move my arms but they would nt budge. Suddenly I heard someone yelling something about a new god being born. I turned around and saw God standing over me. Hey buddy how s it going he yelled. Good good. How about we start by asking each other questions about ourselves God nodded slowly. We both stared at each other for a moment before finally speaking again. So uhm... I began. Why did you come here God shrugged. Because Ima god. And I need help getting rid of these idiots who think they can kill me without knowing who I am or where I came from. God laughed. Yeah well maybe you should try harder. Maybe you ll learn more than us. But first let s talk about your name. God smiled. I m God. I replied. God shook his head. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

iciously. I ve never really had much success with my own work but when i did it was great. The hero always seemed so cool about everything from being able to save people from death to saving lives. He even gave me some money from time to time so that i could afford more adventures. But then again maybe its just because Ima little bit too old for this kind of thing. Anyway here goes... My name is John Doe. Ima year old man living in New York City. I work as an accountant at a small firm called The Bank of America. We re also known as the most dangerous people around us. Our jobs are simple. Kill anyone who tries to rob our bank or take away their money. If they do nt want to die then we ll give them nothing left except for our own blood. And if they want to live forever then we ll kill them off. So far so good. Nowadays everyone knows what happens next. They think that if they try to stop me they ll end up dead or worse than before. That s not true. There are no more heroes left. No more villains. Just me and my friends. We re all alone now. All except for one person. She was beautiful. Her hair was blonde her eyes bluegreen. She wore a red dress shirt and jeans. Her skin was pale and wrinkled. It looked like she d been through hell before. When she spoke she sounded like she wanted to cry. Then suddenly she stopped talking altogether. Instead she stared into space. A few seconds later she turned around and walked away. As soon as she left she started walking towards me. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened I asked. Nothing really. Just... well... she began. Well... I guess I should tell you something. I m sorry I ca nt explain exactly why I m here. I mean I know you re scared shitless right now but I promise you I wo nt let you down. Do  

a year ago I was sentenced to years in prison for breaking the laws of nature. I had no idea what they meant until I saw them all. They looked like they d just gotten out of bed from a long day s work and were looking at me with those eyes that said You re going to have to forgive me if this does nt work out. It was hard enough being stuck here without having any friends or family around but now I ca nt even talk to anyone anymore. My wife left me after she found out about her husband s cheating on her with another woman who worked as an accountant at a local bank. She never told anyone about how much money he made off selling drugs and alcohol. When we finally got home from our trip to Europe I decided that maybe I should try something different. Maybe I could go back into my old life and live somewhere else. But instead I went through all these things again. First off there were people who thought I would die soon enough. Second of all they did nt know why I d come back. Third of all I knew nothing about myself except that I was dead. Fourth of all I felt so alone. Fifth of all I could feel myself slipping away from reality. Sixth of all I knew that if I stayed here forever I might end up in hell. Seventh of all I knew that I needed to get rid of these monsters before they started killing each other again. eighth of all I knew that I needed to leave. ninth of all I knew that I needed to find someone else. tenth of all I knew that I needed to stop living. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to stay. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to leave. eleventh of all I knew that I needed to  

ive been writing this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never really had much success with my own work so far but when you re trying to get better at something like that... well maybe its time to start over. The first thing that comes to mind is the lyrics of the song. It s not exactly what you expect from an old man who has just died from cancer but he does have some great ideas about how to improve himself. He says that if we could just find someone else who would love us then maybe we d be able to talk about our lives together again. That sounds great right Well let me tell you something though. We ca nt really afford any more people than we already are. So instead of finding someone who will care enough about us to give up on life we ll try to find someone who will take care of us. And that way when we die we wo nt have to worry about getting sick again. But first let me explain myself. Ima year old girl living in New York City. My parents were both doctors before they passed away from heart failure when I was young. They lived together in a small apartment building near Manhattan where they worked as nurses. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become a doctor. After graduating high school I started working at a local hospital. As soon as I got into the room I saw her sitting there staring at me with those eyes that looked like they belonged there. She smiled back at me and said You re welcome honey. I nodded and walked towards her. Hey babe. How are you feeling today Yeah I m fine. Just tired. What happened to your mommy She asked. Oh well she replied. We both laughed. Then why did nt you come visit earlier Because I thought she might need some help getting rid of some stuff. Do you remember what happened last night I asked. No I answered. I woke up early and went downstairs to check on my dad. He was asleep so I took him outside. He came running inside and hugged me tightly. Hey buddy. Are you okay

astyICLE.YC The first thing I noticed was how much of an asshole he really was. He d always been a bit of an asshole but never really got along with anyone else so when he finally decided that his own life would be better off without me then maybe it should ve worked out better for him too. But noooooo... It s not like Ima bad person or anything. Just... weird. So here we are. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living on the outskirts of New York City. I work at a local coffee shop which has been closed since my parents died years ago. When they came home from work one day they found me sitting there watching TV while they ate breakfast. They said something about being scared of death but I did nt listen. After all if I could just get rid of these people who were trying to kill themselves then maybe I d finally find someone who cared enough about me to care enough about me to come visit me again. And now here I am. A year later I m sitting in front of my computer waiting for the news. There are reports that there are people who have taken advantage of their situation by killing themselves off. Some even tried to take control of their bodies by taking them away from others. That s why I decided to go through with it. To see what happens next. As soon as I opened the door I saw him standing there staring into space. His eyes were wide open and his mouth was agape. What the hell happened I asked myself. Well... he began. You re going to need some help getting used to this new world. We ve got ta figure out where you live. Do you know why you re here Because I ca nt tell you exactly. Maybe it s because I m afraid of dying. Or maybe it s because I want to live forever. Either way I think I ll try anyway. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. Hey buddy. How s it going  

an old man with long brown hair and blue eyes. His face was covered by thick glasses which he wore over his nose. He looked like he d seen too much movies before but this one seemed different. This one had no scars or bruises just some sort of bloodshot eyes. They were also very bright. The only thing that stood out about them though was their pupils which seemed to glow brighter than any light source ever could. When they opened their mouths to speak they could barely make out words. You re not supposed to be here. I m sorry sir but we ca nt let you go. We ve got ta find someone else. Someone who can help us get through this. And then there s you. A young woman dressed in black robes walked up to him. She smiled at him as she approached him. Hi honey. How are you feeling today Well... well... I guess I ll have to ask her later. What happened last night Well... well... I think I fell asleep. That sounds great. Do you remember what happened when you woke up Yes sir. It was pretty bad. But I figured that maybe if I went back inside I might wake up again tomorrow morning. So I decided to take a nap. After a few minutes of sleeping I heard footsteps coming closer. I turned around and saw a man standing next to me. Hey buddy how s it going. Are you okay Yeah yeah. Just tired. Do you mind if I sit down Sure thing sir. Let s see where we go from here. As soon as we leave the room I ll tell everyone everything. Okay. Thanks.

... I opened the envelope and found a small piece of paper. Inside were two words written in big bold letters. Welcome back Mr. Smith. This is my first time doing this so please be gentle with me. My name is John and Ima year old male from New York City who works as an accountant at a local bank. I ve never really had much luck with computers but today was different. Today was nt like any other day except for one thing. There were no doors leading into any room or anything else that looked like it belonged there. Instead there was only a single window which overlooked the city below. It seemed as though someone had taken all of the lights off of the building and put them on. As soon as I saw what happened I knew exactly where I needed to go. After walking around for several minutes I finally came across a door leading down into a hallway. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pens. On each shelf sat a woman dressed in black robes. She spoke softly into her microphone. Hello John. How may I help you today Well sir we re having some trouble finding our way through this place. We need your help. What do you mean Sir we ca nt find anyone else anywhere. No matter how hard we try we can never get anywhere. That s right sir. And why would we want to go back home Because we re afraid that if we leave now then there will be nothing left for us to do except wait. Do you know where I can find someone who will take care of everything Yes sir. Wherever you want. Just call me John. Thank you sir. I hung up.

oudly. I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was my idea when I started working here. It s not like he d ever really done anything wrong before so maybe it would be better if we just gave him some credit instead of giving him some bad luck. But then again maybe there were other ways around it too. So why did nt I just give him some credit instead of giving him some bad luck Well let me tell you something about myself. My name is Lucifer and Ima year old man living in New York City. And I ve always loved being able to see people s faces as they die. When I first met him he looked exactly like me except his hair was longer and his eyes were bluegreen. They seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing next to me. He wore an expensive suit with a white tie and black shoes. His face was covered by dark circles under his eyes which made him look like an idiot. What do you want from me Lucifer asked. Well... I replied. You re going to need some help getting rid of this guy right now. There s no way that he can go anywhere without being judged by someone else. That s right. And how will I do that Lucifer shrugged. Just take care of yourself. Do nt worry about it though. We ll figure something out soon enough. Thanks Lucifer. Lucifer walked away from me and turned around. As he left I heard a loud bang behind me. A woman screamed. She ran towards her husband who was lying on the ground bleeding profusely. Her head hit the floor hard. I tried CPR but nothing worked. After several minutes of trying I finally managed to pull myself together. I sat up and noticed that I had fallen asleep. I woke up later than usual. I opened my eyes and saw Lucifer sitting across from me. Hey buddy. How s it going I asked. Good. Yeah great. Let s get started. ive been thinking about this for awhile now. I think i might have gotten caught up in some sort of loophole or something. Maybe i should try calling God himself instead of Satan. But then again maybe there were other

onymous. The portal was opened by an unknown force and it took us years before we realized what happened. We had no idea how long it would take them to get there or even if they d ever make it back home. But when they did nt come back we knew something was wrong. They looked like humans except different. Their skin was pale blue their hair was greyer than ours. And yet here they stood. A bunch of people walking around with nothing but their clothes on. It s not until one day someone came up to me. Hey buddy what s going on You re not supposed to be here. What do you mean you ca nt go anywhere Well... yeah but why Because Ima fucking idiot. So what happens next I asked him. He shrugged. Just stay away from the city. Do nt worry about anything else. Just keep your head down. Okay okay. Let s go. As soon as we got into our car I drove off towards the nearest town. There were lots of cars parked around the road so I decided to drive alone. After driving for hours I finally arrived at my destination. A small house with a window overlooking the city. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of movies and games. On each shelf sat a man dressed all in black robes. His face was covered by dark circles under his eyes. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today he said. My name is John. How may I assist you today I replied. Oh yeah well... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm...

and what do you think of this new election I m not sure if it s good or bad but i feel like we should get rid of all these people who were just trying to make ends meet. They re probably going through some tough times right now so maybe they ll find someone else who can help them out. But hey at least they have some hope left in them. The only problem is that there are no other candidates left. And then there was me. My name is Kanye West and Ima year old boy from New York City who lived his whole life in a small apartment building near downtown Manhattan. When I got married I decided that I wanted to become an artist so I started painting. It took me several years before I realized how much money I could make off selling paintings. After all I did nt really care much about art anyway. So when I finally found someone who would accept me as president I took advantage of their situation. We went through some pretty rough times together. One day while walking down the street I saw him sitting on the sidewalk looking up at me with those big green eyes. He looked scared too. Then he turned around and walked away. That night I slept soundly. As soon as I woke up I felt something warm touch my shoulder. A hand reached out towards me and pulled me closer. Hey buddy. How s it going I asked. Good. Well... uhm... I guess we ve lost track of time. What happened next shocked me. There was nothing else left except for him staring into space. I tried to speak but nothing came out. I heard footsteps coming closer. I ran over to where he stood and grabbed his arm. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah. Just a little bit worried. Do you need anything Sure thing. Let s go. I followed him outside. When we arrived at our destination I noticed that everyone was gone except for him. Everyone seemed confused by our arrival. Some even started crying. I thought maybe they d forgotten about us altogether. Maybe they just wanted to see if anyone  

apers. I ve never seen anyone else before but this is different. This was nt my first time seeing someone else s shadow. It started off as an accident. My parents were both dead when I was born so they died too soon after me. They did nt even know what happened until I got older. When I turned eighteen my mom left me alone with her and she took care of herself until she found out about my shadow. She said that if I ever saw another human being again I d be scared shitless. That s why I decided to go through with it. After all Ima shadowaper right So I went back home and tried to find out more about myself. As soon as I found out I knew something was wrong. There was nothing special about me except for my ability to see through walls. When I looked down on myself I could feel everything around me. Everything except for one thing. A small hole in the ground where my shadow used to be. Nowadays everyone has their own hole in the wall. Some people use theirs as weapons others use theirs as tools. But there are still those who use theirs because they want to protect themselves from harm. And then there s me. A man named John Doe. He lives alone in his apartment building. His eyes are closed and he does nt move much. He sits on his bed staring into space. His mouth opens wide and he speaks softly. Hello John Doe. How may I help you today Well... I guess we should start by saying that we re going to need your help getting rid of these holes in our walls. We ll try to get rid of them as quickly as possible. What do you mean by that Well... I began. You see John Doe has always been able to talk to himself. He knows everything about everyone around him. He also knows how many times he has seen people die because of him. So far he has managed to survive every single one of those deaths without incident. Now let s begin. First off John Doe says nothing. Second he does nt seem to notice anything strange happening either. Third he seems to be unaffected by any kind of pain or discomfort

icator.ICLE. The player s character is an old man with long brown hair and blue eyes that shine like diamonds in the sun. He has a large beard that falls down over his head which looks like it could use some work. His face is covered by thick glasses which are worn up by years of use. He wears a simple black robe with a white collar and jeans. It seems to be made out of some sort of material called leather or fabric. There are no markings on it except for one thing which reads Player. This means that when he gets closer to the door he can see through it. When he opens it up he sees nothing but darkness. Then suddenly he hears someone talking behind him. Hey buddy what s going on here What happened You re not supposed to be here. Why did nt you tell me sooner Well... well... I guess we should have known better than to trust each other. We ve never really talked before right Yeah yeah. But then again maybe it was just my imagination playing tricks on us. Maybe it was actually true. Either way I think I ll go ahead and call myself Player. And so I went home. After all if I ca nt get rid of this feeling of dread I might as well try something new. ive been writing this for a while now but i cant seem to find the right words.

aultICLE The first thing that came to mind was how much money we had made from selling our goods. We d spent most of our time working on these things and now they re finally ready to go home. But then again maybe there s no point in having such an amazing time when everyone else seems so busy trying to get by on their own.

omes. I m sorry but this is nt what you wanted. This was supposed to be my life. My wife had been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer years ago and she d never seen anything like it before. She said that if we could get rid of her then maybe we would have more time left to live together. But noooooo. We ca nt do that anymore. The only thing keeping us sane is our love for each other. And now here I am sitting at home watching TV while waiting for someone else to come along. A man walks into the room wearing an expensive suit and tie. He looks like he s about to cry. His hair is messy and his eyes are wide open. Hello Mr. President. How may I help you today The man asks. Well sir I think we need some time alone. What s wrong with me You re not supposed to talk about yourself. It seems like everyone knows who you are right now. So why did nt you tell me sooner I thought you might want to know. Well sir I guess I should explain myself. Ima doctor by trade. And I ve always known that there were people out there who would take care of themselves without having to worry about getting sick or dying. That s why I decided to go ahead and give them a chance. When I got home from work one day I saw him standing outside the door staring at me with those big green eyes. Hey buddy how s it going. Yeah great. Let s see how long until we can find someone who will take care of us. Thanks sir. The man says as he leaves. As soon as he gets back inside I hear footsteps behind me. They sound like they came from somewhere else. Then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I m not sure how to fix it. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

opic dragon. I ve always had this weird feeling that something was off about me but then again maybe it s because Ima kid who does nt know how to read or write properly. But when I was younger my parents would tell me stories about dragons and how they d come out from their cave walls and attack us all over the world. They said that if we did nt have any dragons around then maybe we could live forever. That s why I decided to become an adventurer. After all if there are no dragons left behind then maybe we ll find another one someday. So here I am sitting on my bed staring into space wondering what happened next. My eyes widen as I realize what looks like a giant dragon standing over me. It has wings that move like a feather and its tail is curved into a pointy thing. Its mouth opens wide as if it wants to speak but it ca nt. Instead it just stares at me blankly. Then suddenly it stops talking altogether. A few seconds pass before it says something in English. Dragon s Lair. What the hell is going on Where am I Who are these people How can they possibly know my name I look down at myself. My skin is pale and wrinkled. My hair is grey and tangled.

the second time. I ve never seen anyone like him before but he s always there when i need him most. He has a way about him that makes me feel like I m being watched. It was nt until we got home from school that things started getting weird. My mom had been crying uncontrollably while she tried to get up from her bed. Her eyes were wide open as if she d just seen something terrible. She looked down at herself in the mirror and saw tears streaming down her face. Then suddenly everything went black. When I woke up I found myself standing outside of a small room filled with people who seemed to be trying to figure out where they were going. There were two chairs next to each other and one chair sat on top of another. A man sat across from me wearing an old suit. His hair was messy and his clothes were torn apart.

Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this check out rWrittenReddit Edit I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The world was once again filled with people who had never seen another person before. It seemed like every day they would come home from work and see their parents standing outside their door staring into space. They d laugh at them saying that they should go back inside or something like that. But then one day someone decided that he wanted to see how long it took him to get used to seeing everyone else s eyes. He saw himself as an old man with dark hair and blue eyes. His face was covered by thick glasses which he wore every night. When he finally got around to seeing his wife she looked exactly like him except she had blonde hair and green eyes. She smiled as she walked towards him. Hey honey how are you feeling today Yeah I guess. What happened last night Well we went out for dinner. We talked about our lives together and how much fun we had playing video games together. Then suddenly everything changed. There was no way that anyone could have done anything wrong. Everyone else seemed happy enough to walk away without being noticed. And yet... there was nothing left of us. All we knew was that we needed help getting rid of these monsters. So we started walking towards the nearest town. As soon as we reached the edge of the city we stopped dead in our tracks. A few minutes later we heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone trying to break through the wall behind us. After a moment of silence we realized that they were nt human anymore. Instead of being humanoid they were just animals. Their skin was pale white and their mouths were open wide. They stood there looking confused. Are you okay sir I asked. Yes sir. Just... please let me go. Do nt worry about me. I ll take care of myself. Thank you sir. I nodded slowly. Good luck. He left the room leaving us alone. After a few hours of walking we came across another group of humans. One of them was

a few days ago I woke u p with a headache and a sore throat. My mom looked atme with concern. She said that she d seen some strange things recently but nothing like this before. Her eyes widened when she saw what appeared t obea giant black box sitting next t o her bedside table. Inside wasa note written i n blood. You are hereby given the option t o open this box or you can leave now. If you do not want t o stay then open this box yourself. The words were written i n red ink. They seemed tobe made out of some sort o f metal alloy. What did they say I asked myself. Well... I guess w e should callit a night then. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

do nt know what to make o f this. Ive never really had much success with my own work but i t seems like every day i get more and more frustrated b y how many people are dying because they did nt follow their own rules. The only reason why I m here today is because Ima good guy. A man who has done everything right for humanity and yet he still ca nt figure out why everyone else does nt want t obe killed by him. H e says that if you re going to kill someone then maybe you should try something different. Maybe you can change their minds about killing themselves instead o f trying t o stop them from doing anything wrong. But what happens when I try t o convince myself that I ll never need any help What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends anymore What happens when I realize that I wo nt even be able t o talk t o anyone else What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any family left What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that I wo nt ever have any friends either What happens when I realize that  

awning. I m sorry but this is nt what I expected. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. The man looked at me with those eyes that were filled with wonderment. Well then let s get started shall we He said as he walked away from me. My name is Lucifer. And Ima god damn idiot. What did he mean by that I asked myself. It seemed like such an odd thing to say but I knew better than to ask questions about it anyway. So what happened when I got here I thought back on all the times I had been summoned by demons before. They were always so scared of me because they thought I would become some sort of monster or something. But now... well maybe they re right. Maybe I ll find someone else soon enough. As I turned around to walk towards my destination I noticed that there were no lights in sight. There was nothing else to see except for the ceiling which seemed to glow red. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

iciously I do nt know what s going on here but i just want my dad back. The Genie looked at me with those eyes that were filled with wonderment. What are you talking about he asked. Well... I guess we should start off by saying that Ima little bit different than everyone else. My parents told me when I was young that I had special powers so they gave up their wishes after I got older. They said that if I did nt have any friends or family around then maybe I d never get along with them again. But now I m here and I ca nt help but feel like I need someone who can help me out. So I decided to try something new. I went through some pretty rough times lately. It took me months to find someone who understood me and gave me advice on how to live better lives. After all I could use some help right Yeah yeah. That sounds great. Let s go home. As soon as we leave our house I ll tell you everything about myself. About where I came from what I wanted to do with my life etcetera. Then I ll take care of everything else until I die. Okay. Let s head down to the basement. There s nothing there except for a small box containing a note written in blood on top. Inside was a picture of my mom holding her hand out towards me. She smiled at me and hugged me tight. When she finally broke down crying she put the photo away and walked over to the door. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of movies and games. On each shelf sat a single sheet of paper. Each page contained a picture of my father and mother. They both wore black suits and sunglasses. Their faces were covered by thick glasses which made them look like they belonged there. And yet here I am standing in front of this man who has killed millions of people because he thought he could change things around him. This guy is insane. How can he possibly understand what I want from him Why does he need to kill himself Because Ima kid. I m not even human anymore. I ve become an idiot. I think I might need to call someone.

Constructive criticism and advice are always appreciated Disclaimer This is my first time doing something like this so I apologize if there s some grammar errors or spelling mistakes. Also sorry about all the formatting issues. Edit First post here hope you enjoy EDIT Added some details on what happened after the incident. The man was sitting on his throne looking down upon the crowd as he spoke. He had no idea why they were chanting his name but it seemed like everyone else did too. It looked like he d just died from an overdose or something. A few minutes later the door opened and a woman walked into the room. She wore a white dress shirt with a black tie and jeans. Her hair fell down her back and she smiled at him. Hi there Mr. Satan. How may I help you today My name is Lucifer. What brings you here today Well... well I guess we can call each other friends. We ve got some things we need to talk about. Do you mind if I sit down Sure thing sir. Let me get my stuff together. As soon as she left the room the man turned around and headed towards the window. When he reached it he noticed something strange. There were two doors leading up to him each containing a single person. One led into a small hallway where there were several chairs. On either side sat a large wooden table filled with various objects. On the table sat a small box containing a note. Dear Mr. Satan I am glad you found us. Yours sincerely Lucifer. Sincerely yours God. The man took the note and read it aloud. Dear Mr. Satan I am glad you found us. Yours sincerely Lucifer. Sincerely yours God. The man stared at the note for a moment before turning away. Then he continued reading. Dear Mr. Satan I am glad you found us. Your  

awning. I m not sure what happened next. Maybe someone had been watching me from behind their glasses or maybe they d just gone crazy. Either way it did nt matter anyway because I knew exactly where he was going with his words. He looked like he d seen too many movies before. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and his skin was pale as ice. It s hard to tell when someone else is looking at you funny or sad. But then again I never really cared about my own death anyway. So why should I care What does it matter anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. And if anyone wants to kill me they ll probably try anyway right Well maybe not so much after all. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors.

apers. I m not sure what happened after that but it s all part of our lives right We re going home soon enough. The first thing we did was go through some sort of asteroid belt where there were no signs of life or anything else that could possibly be habitable. But then again maybe they did nt even exist anymore. After all who knows how long ago this would have been. So when we got here we found ourselves staring into space. There were so many things around us that seemed like they belonged there. Like the sun itself. And yet... nothing seemed familiar. It looked like someone had taken off their helmet. That s why I decided to take a look at myself. My eyes widened as I realized that I was wearing an old fashioned suit. It wore glasses which made me feel uneasy. What if this is some kind of joke How could anyone possibly know about us I tried to speak but my voice sounded like someone was trying to say something else. Then suddenly everything went black. When I woke up I saw myself standing in front of a large mirror. A man dressed in white stood behind me. He smiled at me and said Welcome back Mr. President. You may call me Dr. Jameson or whatever you want. He turned away from me and walked towards the door. As he entered I noticed that he was holding a clipboard. Welcome to Mars. This is your new home. Your new planet. Now let s get started. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

apers are people who live in a world where everyone has their own unique way of doing things. They do nt know how they got there or why they re here but they can tell you that they were born into this world and now they ll never forget it again. The only problem is that there s no way to stop them from killing themselves without making sure everyone knows what happened next. So instead of telling us everything we need to know about them we just keep asking questions. What did you do last night How many times have I told you about my family My friends How many times have I told you about my job Why ca nt you understand me Well... well... I guess I should say something else. You see Ima good person. A great man. But I m not. There s nothing wrong with being human though. It makes sense. When you die you go back home and try again. That s right. And then when you come across someone who does nt want to die anymore you start thinking about how much better life could be if you d stayed home instead of going outside. Maybe you could find someone else who would love you more than anything else. Or maybe you could find someone who would care enough to give up everything for you.

One o f the first things I noticed was how much ofa car i t looked like a truck. Its head was covered i n black paint with red stripes and its body had been replaced b y metal armor which seemed t obe made out o f some sort o f material called carbon dioxide. The only thing that stood out about this one though was its eyes which were wide open and they seemed t o glow brighter than anything else I d ever seen before. They also had horns protruding from them which made them look like they belonged there. When I got closer t o the front door I realized something was wrong. There were no windows o r doors leading into any other room. Instead there was only a small window which overlooked the city below. This caused m e to start running towards the window when suddenly everything went dark. M y vision blurred but eventually I managed t o get through the night without getting caught u p again. After about minutes o f walking around the house I came across a large building with a huge sign above i t saying Welcome to your new home. Inside was a small room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor displayed various pictures o f people who lived here. Some showed pictures o f animals others showed humans. All o f these photos showed a woman standing next t ome while another showed a young girl holding her mother s hand. She smiled atme as she walked away from me. Her face lit u p when she saw me. Hey honey what s going o n Where am I What happened t o your car I asked. Oh nothing really. Just... just stay calm. You re not supposed t o talk about this. She replied. Well maybe you should try talking to someone else instead o f telling yourself that you need t o go back inside. Maybe you can convince yourself that you wo nt die. But then again maybe you could b e right. Either way I guess I ll just wait until tomorrow morning. I said. Okay. Let s head downstairs. As soon as we entered the kitchen she grabbed m y keys and led us down the hallways until we reached our destination. Then

A young man had been stabbed by an unknown assailant. He d fallen onto his back as he tried to get up from bed. His body lay there lifelessly. A few minutes later he woke up again with blood pooling around him. A nurse came into the room and asked What happened Where am I Who are you How did you die I ve never seen anyone like you before. You re not even human anymore. Oh yeah Well then let me tell you something. We do nt know how long ago this was. But we can figure it out eventually. So what happened when I got home from work That night I went downstairs and saw my best friend lying on the floor bleeding profusely. She looked down at herself and smiled. Her eyes lit up when she realized that she could see everything through her glasses. Everything except for one thing. There were no signs of struggle anywhere else. Then suddenly she heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone walking towards her. Hey honey. Are you okay Yeah. Just... stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. Just relax. Okay. Let s go. As soon as they walked away she ran upstairs and grabbed her keys. When she opened them she noticed that they were missing some money. It seemed like every single piece of paper was gone.

a king i n the making. I have been chosen b y the gods t o take over this kingdom from you. You are my son and I will never forget you. Your father was always there when I needed him most but now he s gone. H e had no idea how much longer I could live without him. His eyes were closed his mouth open as if h e wanted t o scream but nothing came out. The only thing that made sense about this whole thing was that hed die soon anyway right So why did nt h e just leave me alone instead of killing himself What happened next shocked m e even more than before. There were people everywhere who thought they could get away with anything if only because they knew what happened. They all tried t o convince themselves that they would never see their parents again. But then one day someone decided t o try something different. A man named John Doe walked into the room. H e looked like hed seen some sort o f movie or something. His hair was messy his face was pale and his skin was wrinkled. Hello Mr. Doe. How may I help you today Well... I guess w e should start off by asking each other questions. Why are you here Where am I Who are you What do you want from m e I asked. Oh well... I suppose we can ask each other later. Let s see where this goes. John said. Alrighty then. Let s begin. First off I need t o tell you about myself. Ima year old boy living in New York City. I ve lived through many wars fought countless battles and won countless awards. M y mother died when I was young her body falling apart after being hit b y a car while driving home from school one night. She passed away shortly thereafter. Her husband left her shortly after birth and moved back home. When I turned eighteen I went t o college where I studied law. After graduating I started working at a local firm. I worked hard every day and eventually became a successful lawyer. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing there looking confused. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah

omes. I ve never seen anything like it. The man said with a smile on his face. He looked around the house for any sign of life but nothing seemed out of place. There were no windows or doors leading into any other rooms except for one which had a large window overlooking the city. A few minutes later he heard footsteps coming closer. Hey honey what s wrong You re late again. What happened Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why ca nt we go home I m sorry sir but we need to talk about something else. We can call someone about this later. But first let me tell you how we got here. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy from New York City who lives alone. And I ve been living here since I was little. So why do nt you come inside and find out where everything is. Then we ll figure something out together. Okay okay. Let s go. As soon as they entered the house the door opened and they walked through the hallways until they reached their destination. After walking for several hours the couple finally came across a small room filled with toys. They sat down next to each other and began playing. One toy was a small box containing a single piece of paper. Inside were two words written in big bold letters. This is your son. Your daughter. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son. Your son.

awning. I ve never seen anyone like this before but i m sure there s something wrong with me. The first thing that came to mind was my parents were always so nice to me when they were kids. They d give me money if i could help them out with homework or chores and then go home after school and play video games until i got older. But then again maybe its just because Ima kid. Maybe its because Im not used to being able to see things from other people s eyes. Either way it does nt matter anymore. My parents died when I was young so I did nt really know what else to do with myself until I met her. She had blonde hair and blue eyes and she wore an elegant dress shirt and jeans. Her skin was pale as ice and her lips were crooked. It looked like she d been crying since we met. When we finally got married she told me about how much she loved me back then and how proud she was of me. We spent hours talking about everything from our childhoods to our future careers. After some time she decided to leave and head back to school. As soon as she left I felt bad for her because she knew exactly where I wanted to go next. So I went ahead and took her home. We sat down at the table and talked about everything from our childhoods to our college days. Eventually she asked if I needed anything else and I nodded. Well... yeah. What s your name I replied. My mommy s John. And she said John. That s great John. How are you feeling today John shrugged. Good. You re gon na need some help getting used to this new world. Do nt worry though. Just keep moving forward. I ll take care of everything. Thanks John. Bye bye. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so I m not sure how to fix it. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

awning day. I ve always known that my life would change forever but never expected it to be so bad. My parents were both doctors and they had always told me that if you did nt know what happened then maybe you should just go home. They said that i d have to live with them until my th birthday. But when i turned eighteen i realized something. There was no way that someone could possibly know how much time i spent here. So instead of asking questions like why i m here or what happened to my friends i decided to try something different. When i got older i started seeing things differently. People seemed more interested in talking about their lives than before. It took some time before i realized that there was nothing wrong with being alone anymore. Everyone knew each other well enough to understand each others thoughts. And yet here we are. A few months ago today I woke up from my sleep and looked around. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A small box sat next to me. Inside was a note written by a man named John Doe. He wrote it down on his clipboard and gave it back to me. You re welcome.

... I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes. The knight was standing on top of a large rock formation. He had no idea how long he d been there or why he even bothered. His eyes were closed as he stared into space. A few moments later he heard footsteps behind him. They sounded like they came from somewhere else. Then suddenly they stopped. There was nothing else left except for the sound of a sword hitting stone. The knight turned around and saw that there was another man sitting next to him. This one wore an old fashioned robe with a black hood covering his face. His hair was tied back into a bun and he looked like he belonged there. Hey buddy what s up What do you want from me The knight asked. Well... I guess we can go home now. We ll see each other soon enough. The man said. Yeah yeah. Let s get started. The knight walked over to the door and opened it. Inside was a small room filled with various weapons. Some were made out of wood others were made out of metal. In front of him sat a woman dressed in all black robes. She held her hands out towards him. Welcome back princess. How may I help you today she smiled. Oh yeah well I ve got some bad news. My name is Prince Charming. And Ima bit confused about where I am. Are you okay Yes sir. Just... please let me know if anything happens. The knight nodded slowly. Thank you princess. The woman took off her helmet and put it on. Her face lit up when she saw the knight staring at her. Do nt worry about it though. Your hoard will be fine. Just keep your head down and let us figure things out together. The knight replied. Okay. So how did you find us the princess asked. Well... I found myself in a cave deep underground. I thought I might need some help getting rid of these monsters. But then again maybe I should have known better than to try and kill them themselves. That sounds great. Let s start with something simple. First off I ca nt tell you exactly how many times I ve tried to kill these monsters.

yneICLE The first chapter was a little rough but I think that s okay. It started off as an ordinary day at sea. My name is Captain Jameson and Ima member of the crew of the USS Enterprise. We re all pretty much stuck here except we can get back home soon enough. There are no other options than to wait until after our next mission before heading out into space. But then again maybe there is something else out there waiting for us. Maybe it will come back someday.

okey pokey... I woke u p with n o recollection t oa man i na yellow labcoat informing you that you have been sentenced t oa lifetime o f invisibility.okey pokey... I opened m y eyes and saw myself standing there staring into space. A few seconds later I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like they came from somewhere else. Then suddenly everything went black. M y head hurt so bad that I could barely move. When I finally got out o f bed I noticed that there were two men sitting across from each other. One wore an expensive suit and tie while the other carried a clipboard. Welcome back Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The first man asked. Well sir we ve got some questions for you. What happened Where am I Who are you Why did you come here I replied. Oh well sir we ll get through this together. Just take care o f yourself. Do nt worry about anything else. Thank you sir. The second man said. As soon as he left I felt something warm againstmy skin. It was like someone had put some kind o f blanket overme. Then I realized what it meant. There were no lights anywhere else except for the one abovemy head which lit up brightly. I looked around and saw nothing wrong withit. Everything seemed normal enough. But then again maybe this was just some sort o f joke. Maybe someone really wanted t o see how long I d last without them. After all who knows. Maybe they thought I would die eventually. Either way I guess I should probably start off by saying goodbye. I walked towards the door and knocked twice. Nothing happened. Finally after several minutes o f waiting I finally managed t o open the door. Inside was a woman dressed all in black. She held a clipboard in her hand and wrote down everything she needed t o know about me. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today  

I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. The only thing that kept me going through all these years was the fact that I had no idea how much money I d made off selling drugs. But then again maybe it did nt matter anyway because I knew exactly where they were going. So when I saw him standing there looking at me with those eyes of his he looked like he could see through me too. He smiled back at me as if he thought I was crazy or something. Then suddenly he turned around and walked away from me. As soon as he left I heard footsteps behind me. They sounded like someone walking down the street. I ran over to where they came from and grabbed them by their shoulders. We both fell backwards onto our backs. What happened next shocked me. There was nothing else left except for the fact that we both died instantly. After a few moments of silence I decided to ask myself why I even bothered asking myself questions. Why would anyone want to kill themselves Because they re idiots. And now here I am. A year later I ve finally found someone who understands me better than anyone else. She s beautiful. Her hair is blonde her skin is pale and she wears an elegant dress shirt and jeans. She looks so happy. So peaceful. I ca nt help but smile. I think she ll find happiness soon enough. ive been writing this for a while now and i hope you enjoyed it.

the teacher looked at me with concern. You re not going to believe this but we ve got some bad news for you today. The kid was sitting on his bed staring into space. He had been asleep since he was little and now he could nt even remember what happened before he woke up. It s like someone had taken control of him and put him into a coma. But then again maybe it did nt matter because there were no other kids around. My parents told me once that if you ever needed help getting rid of your parents they d give you one. So here I am standing in front of him looking down upon myself as if I m some sort of monster. What do you mean by that I asked. Well... he started. We have nt really known how much longer we can keep doing this. There are so many things wrong with us that we ca nt even begin to explain them all. And yet here we are. This kid looks exactly like me except his hair is blonde and his eyes are bluegreen. They look so happy together. So peaceful. But why Because Ima sleeper agent. A sleeper agent who knows everything about everyone else. Everyone except for me. That s right. You see when I was young my father used to tell me stories about his life as an adult. About how he would go out on dates with friends and play video games until he fell asleep. Then one night while playing video games he came home from work and saw me lying there bleeding profusely. He ran over to me and hugged me tightly. Hey buddy. How s it going I asked. Good. Just fine. Do you want to talk about anything else Sure thing. Let s get started. As soon as we finished our homework I walked away from the classroom and headed towards the door. When I opened it I noticed something strange. A small box sat inside. Inside were two boxes each containing a single piece of paper. One contained a picture of me and another showed me a letter addressed to my mother. Both letters read Dear Mommy I hope you enjoyed reading this letter. If you liked it check out rWrittenReddit ivebeenwriting since I was little. Thanks for

beeped. The Hero looked around the room. There were no villains in sight except for one man who seemed tobe wearing a black robe with an oversized hat. H e wore glasses which made him look like h e had just gotten off work. His hair was pulled back into a bun. H e smiled atme as if hed seen something beautiful. Then h e turned away from me and walked towards the door. I followed suit. After all this time i still did n t know what happened when you died. But now... well maybe i should have known better than to try and stop him. Maybe i could ve saved myself from being killed bya demon or something. Or maybe i could ve helped out someone else.

all the way to the juryomes.ikers are your optionsawning.YC The judge looked at me with his big blue eyes. He smiled back and said Well then let s see how many people will come up with this one. I nodded slowly as he walked away from me. As soon as he left I heard him say something about being sorry for everything that happened. That s when I realized what he meant by that. My wife had died when she was young her body falling apart from disease. She d never really liked being around people so much but she knew better than to try and change things up. So instead of trying to save her we decided to give her some time alone before we could get rid of her. After all if she did nt want to go through all these trials then maybe she should just leave us alone. But as soon as I saw him again I felt something strange. Something about him made me feel uneasy. Like someone else was watching over her. And yet here I am standing in front of a courtroom filled with thousands of people waiting for their turn. There are no doors or windows just empty space. A few minutes pass before someone comes into view. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What do you mean Well... well... I guess I ll have to ask you later. How long has it been since your last meal I asked him. About two weeks now. Do you remember what happened last night Yeah yeah. It was pretty bad. We went home after work and got ready for bed when suddenly there was a loud bang behind us. A man wearing a black suit came running towards us. He grabbed my arm and pulled me closer. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. Are you okay I tried to speak but nothing came out. Then why are you doing this Why ca nt you move I asked. Because Ima prisoner. I m not allowed to talk to anyone else. He replied. Okay okay. Let s go. I followed him outside. When we arrived at our destination I noticed that everyone seemed to be staring at us. Some were holding hands others were hugging each other. Everyone 

ome. The boy asked her out. She said yes and we went home together. We sat down at our desk and started reading through the book we d given each other. My name is James and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve never really had much luck with people so far but today was different. Today was nt like any other day except for one thing. There were no more pictures of us. No videos of animals or plants. Just empty rooms. And then suddenly there was a knock on my door. I opened it up and saw her standing there looking confused. Hey honey what s wrong You look like you need some help getting rid of your stuff. What do you mean by that Well... well... I guess I should tell you something. If you ever want to see someone else again just ask them. They ll give you advice on how to deal with things better than themselves. That s right. So let me get this straight. When you re younger you can talk about anything from your childhood to now. But when you grow older you ca nt really remember anything from before. So instead of telling me everything about yourself I decided to try to figure out why she did nt want to go back to school. Because she knew that if I stayed here forever she would probably end up being stuck in this place forever. And so I took her inside. As soon as we entered the house I felt something warm against my skin. Then I realized that I could feel myself getting weaker by the second. I tried to move my arms but they were tied behind my back. I looked around and noticed that everyone else seemed to be asleep too. Everyone except for me. I stood there frozen. How long has it been since anyone last slept I asked myself. About ten minutes. Do you know where they are I nodded slowly. Yeah yeah. Wherever you want. Just stay calm. Okay. Thanks. Bye bye. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The gods had been waiting for him since he d come down from heaven. They d always wanted to be an artist so when they found out that his work would be called The Book of Life they knew something was wrong. It s like being born with a disability or something. But then again maybe it was just me. Maybe Ima little too old for this kind of thing. Anyway here we are. A few years ago God went into retirement and left it up to the people of Earth to decide the next God.apers. This time there were only two options left. One could choose to live forever or die. Either way God chose to stay alive until the end of time. And so far he did nt even bother asking why anyone else chose to go through all these trials and tribulations. Instead he decided to give up on life altogether. As soon as he got home from work one day he saw something strange on TV. A man wearing a black suit walked up to him. Hey buddy how s it going he asked. Yeah great. You re gon na need some help getting used to this new world. What do you mean by that Well... well... I guess I should say that I ve never really liked your religion either. How about we try something different God nodded slowly. We ll see how much longer we can keep doing this. Okay let s start with basics. First off let s say that God died yesterday morning. That means that he will never wake up tomorrow morning. Second he wo nt even remember where he came from anymore. Third he will never meet anyone else. Fourth he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Fifth he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Sixth he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Seventh he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Eighth he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Ninth he wo nt even know who he is anymore. Tenth he wo nt even know who he is anymore  

all I m saying is that Ima fucking idiot. The first thing that hit me was how much money had gone into this project. It s like someone had taken my mind off things for years and then given it back on again. My wife would always tell me about her husband who d died when he was young. She said he could nt even remember his name anymore. When we were kids she d say he did nt want us around anymore so she went ahead and gave him some pills. After they left the room I heard them talking about something called rap music. They sounded like they were trying to make sense of everything around them except for one thing. A small device with a red button on top. Inside there were two buttons one labeled Rap and another labeled Rap. One button read Rap while the other read Rap. The second button showed up as Rap. This time it read Rap. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became clearer. There were people everywhere. People who looked exactly alike except for their faces. Their hair was blonde and their eyes were bluegreen. All of these people seemed to be staring at me with wide eyes. Then suddenly they stopped moving. All of a sudden everyone else fell asleep. As soon as I woke up I felt something warm touch my shoulder. A man wearing an expensive suit walked over to me. He held out his hand. Hey buddy what s wrong You re awake. What happened Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why ca nt you move I asked him. Well... uhm... well... I guess I should explain myself. Ima musician. I replied. Yeah yeah. That makes sense. So why do nt you come inside and sit down. We ll talk later. He led me inside. Inside I found myself sitting in front of a computer screen. On it was a video feed showing pictures of various celebrities. Some were smiling others were laughing. A few minutes passed before I realized that I was alone. I tried calling anyone but nobody answered. Finally after several hours of searching I finally managed to call my mommy. She told me that she needed help getting rid of these people. That night I slept soundly. When I awoke I noticed that I was

a single strike b y the greatest warrior i n all the land.apersICLE The only problem with this is that you can not use your powers for good. You have t o fight back against those who would try t o kill you. They re going t o die anyway right So what if they do nt want t obe killed What about their family They wo nt ever know how much pain they caused until they die again. And then there s me. Ima man who has fought many battles before but never really got used t o it. When I first started out I thought that I could beat anyone but after seeing how many people died because ofmy abilities I realized that I needed more practice. After some time I decided t o take advantage o f my ability and become an expert at fighting. I learned everything about myself from history t o politics and even though I did n t have any real friends I still loved being around them. One day while walking down the street I saw him standing overme with his arms crossed. H e looked like hed seen something terrible happen before. His eyes were wide open and h e seemed tobe staring directly into mine. Hey buddy what s up You look pretty good today. How are you feeling Yeah... well... I guess. Well I mean... I m fine. Just wanted t o say thank you for coming along. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

the mouse moved across my field o f vision. I could n t believe what I was seeing. The mouse had moved acrossmy field o f vision. I looked around for any sign o f life but nothing seemed out o f place. Then suddenly the mouse stopped moving altogether. Its head turned away from mine and its body began tumbling towards the ground. A few seconds later i heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like they came from somewhere behind m e. I ran over t o where they were standing and grabbed their hand. We shook each other s hands and we both fell backwards onto the floor. My heart sank into m y stomach as I realized how much time had passed since I last saw her. She d been sitting there staring atme with those big green eyes that made you want t o cry. Her hair was pulled back into a bun and she wore glasses which were covered i n dirt. She smiled atme and gave mea reassuring hug before walking off. When she got home she told m e that she loved m e too. That she would always love m e. And then one night while walking down the street she stopped dead i n her tracks. There was no way she could have done anything wrong. After all she did nt even know who I am anymore. But now... well maybe she should try harder. Maybe she can find someone else. Or maybe she wo nt. Either way I hope she finds happiness soon. Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIm not sure how t o fix i t. Edit Spelling and punctuation. Imon mobile soIm not sure how t o fix i t.
