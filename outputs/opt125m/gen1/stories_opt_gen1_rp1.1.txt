The year is. I m not sure what I expected when I was sent back in time but it was all so confusing. It was like I had been here before. I was in my room watching the news. The news was reporting that the United States has been invaded by aliens. I was confused because I thought it was a joke but I did nt know what to do. I tried to think of something but it was just a dream. I went to bed and woke up in my room. I looked at the clock and it read AM. I felt like I was going to die. I went to the bathroom and got dressed. I went to the kitchen and grabbed a glass of water. I drank it and then I heard a noise. It was a loud banging on the door. I looked out the window and saw the aliens coming towards me. They were looking for me. I ran out the door and went to my room. I looked at my watch and it read AM. I went to my bed and got ready to sleep. I went to my desk and started writing down notes. I was about to go to sleep when I heard a noise. It was a loud banging on the door.

The dragon was a beautiful thing. It had wings that seemed to be made of pure gold and it had a tail that was so long that it almost seemed like it was made of fire. It was so big that it was able to lift a lot of people and it had a huge mouth. It was also very tall. I was so excited to see what would happen when I finally got my first dragon. I thought that if I could get my first dragon to eat me I would be happy. But I did nt want to be a dragon. I wanted to be a dragon. So I went to my room and started to sleep. When I woke up I saw my mother sitting on the couch. She looked at me with her big eyes and said You have to go. She turned around and walked away. I looked at my birthday cake and saw that it was the same size as my dragon. I looked at my mom and she turned around and said You have to go. She turned back around and said You have to go.

I went to his closet and found him. I grabbed him by the shoulders and started to cry. I had never seen him like this before. I looked at him and said What are you doing here I ve been living in my closet for years and I m not even sure if I have any roommates. I tried to explain that I had no roommates but he just stared at me. I thought about going out and asking him for help but I knew he would nt listen. I decided to go out and ask him to help me out. I walked into his room and saw him sleeping on the bed. He was covered in blood. I asked him if he had seen anything strange. He said he did nt know.
