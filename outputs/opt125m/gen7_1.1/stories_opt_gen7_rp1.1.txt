I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The man was sitting on his bed staring into space as he thought about how much fun it would be to write something like that. He had no idea why he d chosen to go through all these trouble just wanted to see where things went wrong with them. It s hard enough being an author without having your own characters around when everyone else does nt even know who they re talking about. But then again maybe there are other ways too. Maybe we should try harder. My name is James and Ima year old boy living in New York City.

Harry Potter  ive been working on this for years now and i still do nt know what it is about me but I just ca nt seem to find any inspiration in my own work so far. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m not sure if you guys like it or not but here goes... The wizarding world was once again filled with wizards who had never seen such an amazing power before. They were always able to make things happen without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of spellbook or something else entirely. But then there s one thing left that does nt change though. There are no more wizards left alive than us right So we re going to have to take action. We ll start by making sure everyone knows how much money they made off selling their spells.

o f the teacher looked around nervously. There were no other students left i n the classroom except for him who seemed confused b y what h e had just created. H e tried t o explain himself but could n t get any answers from anyone else. After several minutes o f silence the teacher finally spoke again. You r e not supposed tobe here. This is your first time doing something like this s o please come back tomorrow morning and tell everyone about how much fun it was. The next day the boy went home after school and sat down next t o his mother who told her that she loved her son more than anything else. She also said that hed never seen such an amazing thing before. When she got back inside she found herself staring into space. It was beautiful. Her eyes widened when she saw what appeared t obea giant ball floating above her head. What did you make mommy asked the boy. Well... I guess w e should call i t a circle then. W e can use its power against ourselves right Yeah yeah. But why Because Ima wizard. And I need help getting rid o f these things. Mommy I ca nt believe you d try t o create such a stupid circle. How many times have I done this before Why does everyone always think they r e going crazy That s because they are. And yet here we are. A few weeks ago the boy started using his powers against others. He used them all night long until one day h e decided t o go outside. H e walked over t o where his friend lay and grabbed his arm. Hey buddy what s wrong he yelled. Nothing really. Just wanted t o see if anyone else noticed anything strange happening. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. M y vision blurred and I felt dizzy. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone walking towards m e. I turned around and saw two men standing behindme. One wore a black suit and tie while the other carried a large bag full o f money. Both held guns pointed directlyat  

um.ikers are now allowed t o enter their houseomes.ICLE. The doorbell rang as I opened my eyes. My heart sank into my stomach when I saw him standing there looking at me with those big green eyes that made you want to vomit. He looked like he d seen something before but never really got around t o seeing anything else than himself. His hair was messy his face was pale and his skin was wrinkled. What s wrong kid You asked for help last night right Well... yeah. It seems we ve lost contact with our home planet. We re going t o need some more information about where they came from or why they did nt come back sooner. But first let me tell you something.

a young woman i s suddenly transported t o the future and her parents are devastated. She has nt had much luck with her powers but when she did manage t o get them working she realized something was wrong. Her mother had always told her that if you could see through walls then maybe it would help people out with their problems. But now... well maybe not anymore. Maybe I should just leave her alone. The doctor thought about going back home and telling everyone how much fun he d have playing video games together. After all who wants t obe around someone else when they can go anywhere without seeing yourself again right Well let m e tell you about myself. Ima little older than most kids so I guess I ll probably never be able t o talk properly either. When I was younger I used t o play video games all day long. Nowadays I sit down onmy bed watching TV while waiting for my turn t o come along. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother trying anymore. Because I know exactly where I am. And sometimes I feel bad because I ca nt move forward without hearing voices coming from behindme. That s okay though. You re safe now. Just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything.

the first thing I noticed was how dark my room looked when I woke up today. It seemed like every single lightbulb had gone off except for one which lit up with an eerie blue glow as if someone had put some sort of lamp on it. Then there were two more lights coming from behind me each one brighter than before. One of them even started glowing redder than usual. When they finally stopped glowing altogether though I realized what happened. My bedside table lay empty save for three chairs opposite each other. They all sat down next to mine while another chair stood there staring at nothingness. After about minutes of sitting there waiting for them to finish talking I decided that maybe this would be better than nothing. Maybe I should try something different. As soon as I got out of bed I walked over to where my computer used to be and opened up Reddit.comrWritingPrompts. There were no posts from anyone else anywhere so I figured that maybe they d just leave us alone until we found another way to get rid of these people. But then again who wants to live forever anyway right So I went back inside and checked reddit.comrWritingPrompts. Nothing came up. What s wrong with it I asked myself. Nothing really. Just... weird. After checking reddit again I found that everyone else seemed to be asleep except for me. That s odd because I did nt feel any pain whatsoever. And yet here I am standing in front of my mirror looking back at myself with those same eyes. How can this happen Why ca nt anyone move around without having to worry about getting hit by cars or falling asleep on their couch I tried calling my parents but they would nt answer. Finally after several hours of searching I finally managed to call my sister who told her that she needed help finding her husband. She said that he was dead too. That night we slept together in bed watching TV while listening to music. We talked about our lives together and how much fun it was having kids ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

. I ve never seen anything like it before. It s just so beautiful. So bright. But then again maybe this was nt such a bad thing after all. Maybe we should have known better than to try it out ourselves. We re going home soon right Well let me tell you something about myself. Ima little bit different than everyone else. My parents were both doctors when they died from cancer years ago. They had always told me that if I did nt get enough money from them soon enough I d probably end up dead too. And yet here I am sitting on my bed staring into nothingness thinking about how much fun it would be if I could go back in time and change things up. What do you mean by that I asked myself as I looked down at myself. There was no way I could ever live without seeing her again. She smiled at me as she walked away from me. Her eyes lit up when she saw me standing there looking back at her. Hey honey. How are you feeling today Yeah... good. Just got ta keep moving forward. Do you want some coffee or something Sure thing babe. As soon as she left I heard footsteps behind me. A man wearing an expensive suit came running towards us. He wore glasses which made him look like he belonged there. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The man said. Oh yeah well I guess I ll need your help getting rid of these mirrors. They seem to glow brighter every day. Are you okay Yes sir. Thank you. I replied. Then why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward Because I can only see myself anymore. That makes sense. Now let s talk about our lives together. ive been trying to figure out where I am since i was little. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

etterlyICLE. The first thing I noticed was how much money had been made from selling my soul t o otherworldly beingsomesICLE. It seemed like such an easy task but then again maybe its just because Ima kid who does nt really care about anything else than himself. After all if there were no more wars or famine why would anyone want t obe dead anyway Well let me tell you something. You re not going anywhere anytime soon right So what do we do now We can try t o get rid of these idiots but first they need t o learn how t o use their powers properly. First off they ll probably never see each other again. Second they wo nt even know where they came from until they die. Thirdly they will never meet anyone again. And fourthly they will never hear anything from us either. That s when I realized something was wrong. My parents always told m e stories about how their ancestors used t o live on Earth before the war ended. They said that w e d become too advanced for them t o handle themselves anymore. But now... well maybe not anymore. Maybe someday someone will find out what happened t o those who did nt make it through college without getting married or having kids. Or maybe they ll finally understand why I ca nt go home anymore. Either way I guess Ill just leave this place behind. As soon as I got out o f bed I walked over t omy room and opened upmy laptop. There were two tabs open one labeled Science and another titled Technology. Both tabs showed pictures of various countries around the globe. One picture showed a young girl holding her mother s hand while she looked downat herself in the mirror. She smiled back atme as she stared into space. Her eyes lit u p when she saw the stars above her head. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would b e greatly appreciated.

...awning. I do nt know how long i ve been here or why but when my parents died i was devastated. They had always told me stories about their lives being filled with pain and suffering until they met her. She looked like she d just gotten out of bed from work and then suddenly everything went black. When she came back into view again she smiled at me as if she knew something important. Her eyes were wide open and her mouth opened slightly as if she wanted to speak. You re going to love this one. It s not much different than your own except for one thing. There are no more ghosts left alive than before. And yet... I ca nt help but feel bad for them. What happened next shocked me so many times that i could barely move around anymore. My mom tried talking to her husband but he did nt understand what she said. He thought maybe she meant something else entirely. After all who knows Maybe she really does want to go home. But instead she gave up on trying to talk to him altogether. So instead she sat down next to me and started reading through some books on the internet. One book contained pictures of people walking around in circles while another showed images of animals playing games together. Both photos showed a young girl holding a dog while another showed a boy wearing a red shirt. All these things seemed familiar though they also made sense. Then suddenly she stopped looking at me altogether. Instead she stared directly into mine. Are you okay honey I asked. Yeah yeah I m fine. Just... please let me get rid of these things. Do nt worry about anything else. We ll figure something out soon enough. Thanks. Bye bye. As soon as she finished reading I turned off the lights and walked over to where she lay. Inside was a small box containing a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Smith This letter contains information regarding your death. Please take care of yourself and stay safe. Your family will miss you dearly. Sincerely yours ive never seen such beauty before. Sincerely yours ive never seen such beautiful

be carefulawning. The message reads Level II cooking required t o use objectawning. I look around the room for any sign of life or even anything else that might have been alive before this whole thing started. Nothing seems out of place except for my own bowl which has been empty since yesterday morning. My eyes widen as I realize what s happening. There are no windows or doors leading into any other kitchen than mine. A few seconds pass before someone comes over and says Hey buddy how s it going You turn off your lights and walk towards him. He looks confused. What do you mean he asks himself. Well... I guess we should call it a day then. We ll see if there s anything interesting about this place today. As soon as he leaves the house I hear footsteps behind me. They re getting closer every second until they reach our door. When they finally arrive I open it up and find myself staring at a large screen displaying pictures of people who were born years ago. Some were smiling others were crying some were laughing. All of these photos showed a man wearing a white lab coat holding a clipboard. His face was covered by dark circles under his eyes which seemed to glow brighter than anything else. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The man asked. Oh yeah well I think I might need some help getting rid of these things. Do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone. Just give me a moment. Thank you sir. I nodded slowly. Alrighty then let s get started. Let s start with basics. First off I m sorry to bother you but I ca nt allow any kind of trouble. Second I hope you enjoy your stay here. Thirdly please take care of yourself. Fourthly remember that if you ever feel lonely or scared please call us at. Fifthly remember that we love you very much. Sixthly remember that we will always protect you from harm ive done wrong. Seventhly remember that we will always make sure you live forever. Ninthly remember that we will always keep you safe from harm ive done wrong. Tenthly remember that we will always make sure you die

His hair was messy his eyes were wide open and his skin was pale as ice. What s wrong kid You asked me not to go through all these things again. Well... yeah. But why Because Ima fucking idiot.

ake myself out for dinner with my parents. They were both very nice people but they did nt really care much about me anyway. My mom had always told her that if she could get rid of these guys then maybe we d be able to live together forever. She said that when she got older she would take care of everything else while dad worked at his job as an accountant. When he finally came back from school one night after being hit by a car he looked up at me with those big green eyes that made him feel like he was floating through space. His face lit up as he realized what happened next. A man wearing black robes walked over to us and asked What s wrong kid You re not supposed to talk to strangers. It does nt matter how many times you try it or even if it works. Just tell yourself that you wo nt die today. And so I went ahead and spoke again. So... where am I Who are these people Why ca nt they see me Well... well... I guess I should say something else. Ima little confused right now. But hey maybe someday someone will find out. Maybe they ll understand why I m here. After all I ve never seen anyone else before. As soon as I finished speaking the door opened and two men entered. One wore a white shirt and jeans while the other carried a large bag full of food. Both held guns pointed directly at me. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I Who are these people How can I help you today The first man pulled out a small pistol and shot himself in the head. He fell backwards onto the ground unconscious. Then he started screaming. That sounds great sonny. Let s go inside. We sat down next to each other and began talking. About our lives together how we met each other how we became friends etcetera. Eventually  

next toa stranger that changed your life. all you need t o do i s wait for them t o come back and you can make anything happen but this time its different.apers are now the default. I m not sure if it s because Ima little too old or maybe its just my imagination but when I was younger my parents would always tell me stories about how they used to be able t o fight crime together before the war ended. Nowadays everyone has their own way of doing things so there are no more wars left alive than we did when we first started out. But then again who wants to die after being stuck here forever anyway It seems like such a waste though because what happens next Well... well... I guess Ill try something new today. As soon as I get home from work I ll go check on my wife who needs some help getting ready for school tomorrow morning. She wo nt be able t o see her husband yet so she might as well take him inside himself. When h e arrives he looks atme with those big green eyes that look like they ve seen too much movies. His face goes pale and his hands shake uncontrollably. What happened John asked. Oh nothing really. Just got ta sleep. You re awake now right Yeah yeah. So why did you leave Because I wanted t obea hero. And now here I am standing in front ofmy mirror staring into nothingness. There are only two things left todo.

yICLE. The Hero s eyes widened as he realized what had happened. He d never seen such an amazing fight before but it seemed like every time someone did something wrong they would get better at it. But then again maybe not so much after all. Maybe even worse than when he first started out with his powers. When he got older though things changed. His power became more powerful than ever before. And now here we are. A man standing over me holding a gun. What do you want from me I asked him. Well... I guess I ll give you some advice. If you ever need anything just call me. My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations Security Council. We ve been working together since we were kids. So far nothing has worked out well for us. There are no heroes left in our world except for those who can stop crime or save lives. That means that if anyone wants to live forever they must kill themselves right Yeah yeah. Let s go home.

The following is an excerpt from my book The Book Thief https www.reddit.comrWritingPromptscommentsvqwpyouaregoingtobeastasacademycwpyourbookjokeissovenethedaywhenyourfavouritepersonhasbecomeanapocalypsecgk context I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City when suddenly there s a knock on my door. It s me. Hey buddy how s it going You re late again. What do you mean by that Well we ve got some new stuff coming out today. We ll see about getting rid of them before they start killing each other again right Yeah yeah. Let s go inside. As soon as we enter the house I hear footsteps behind us. They sound like someone knocking on my window. Then suddenly everything stops. There are two men standing outside holding guns. One of them looks like he wants to shoot someone while the other one pulls out his phone. Both look confused. Are you okay sir Yes sir. Just wanted to make sure you did nt get hurt. Do you need help No problem. Thank you. And then they both leave without saying goodbye. When they arrive home I sit down next to him and wait until morning when I finally decide to call my parents. They both tell me that they loved me too much to let go. That I should probably leave now because I ca nt sleep anymore. After all I had no idea where I d end up without them. But after waiting hours I finally managed to find my way back into bed. I closed my eyes and waited for the light to fade away. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Also thanks for reading If you enjoyed this check out rWrittenReddit Edit Grammar Disclaimer This is my first attempt at writing anything other than a short story and i really hope that s okay EDIT Fixed some spelling errors See Also https www.reddit.comrWritingPromptscommentsvqwpyouarethefirstpersoninhistorytofindacommentsjwpyourlightstheyearandthisisntwhatIwantcommentstzkxh context The year is. A group of scientists have discovered that they can create machines capable of creating people who will never die from disease or injury. They call them Light Machines because they re able to see through walls without having to worry about getting sick again. In fact most people use these machines as weapons against each other because there are no laws against using them anymore. However one scientist says he ll try again tomorrow morning when he gets home from work. He tells his wife that she should go back inside and find someone else to talk to. She does nt want her husband dead either so instead she went outside and found herself staring into space. Her eyes widened as she realized how much longer she could live without seeing things differently. As soon as she looked up at the sky she saw nothing but stars above us all. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became brighter than ever before. There were clouds moving closer together than ever before. And then suddenly everything stopped moving altogether. All of a sudden everyone fell asleep except for me. My head hurt and my heart rate increased exponentially. When I woke up I felt dizzy and nauseous. I tried to stand but I could nt move. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. I ran over to where they came from and grabbed their hand. We walked towards each other and hugged tightly. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened Where am I Who are you Why ca nt you speak English  

opic. I ve never seen anything like it before but i m sure there s something wrong with me. The only thing that makes sense is how much pain i t must be for everyone else to suffer from this disease. It does nt matter if they re dead or alive because they ll always be alive again. But then again maybe its not such a bad thing after all. After all Ima good person right And besides Ima human being afterall right So why should I care about them anyway They were supposed to die when they got sick or injured. That s why I decided to take action. My wife died when she was only five years old her body falling apart as soon as she tried to get up from bed. She d been hit by a car while driving home from school one night. Her head exploded instantly. When we came back into our house I found myself staring at my phone screen wondering what happened next. There were two men standing outside holding guns. One of them looked like he wanted to shoot someone while the other held out his hand. Both wore black suits with white ties. Their faces were covered in blood. What do you want from us asked the man who pointed his gun at me. Well... I guess I could give you some advice. If you ever need anything call me. He said. Okay thanks. I replied. As soon as I walked away from him I heard footsteps behind me. A woman s voice called out Hey honey what s going on Where am I Who are you How did you get here Why ca nt you move I asked. Oh yeah well I suppose I should tell you. We re all pretty confused right now. Do you know where your family is Yeah yeah. Just stay calm. Your parents will come over tomorrow morning. Thanks.

.ikers are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The doorbell rang as he entered his apartment building. He opened it slowly and stepped inside. There was no one else around except him who looked like they d seen something before. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and he wore glasses which made them look like they belonged on someone else s face. Hello sir how may I help you today My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations Security Council. We ve got some bad news for you. What happened last night Well we re having trouble finding our way through this world without getting caught up in some sort of war or famine. That means that if anyone wants us dead then let them go ahead and kill themselves instantly. But first let me tell you about myself. Ima year old man living alone in my apartment building. I live alone too. And when I woke up today morning I found myself staring into space. It seemed like forever until finally I realized that I could see everything through walls. Everything except one thing. A small box sat next to me. Inside was a note written by a woman named Elizabeth. She read it aloud to herself as she walked towards her car. Her voice sounded like she wanted to cry but she did nt want to. Instead she kept walking until she reached her destination. As soon as she arrived she noticed that everyone else was gone. Everyone except for her. Everyone except for her. All of them stood there frozen. Then suddenly she heard footsteps coming closer. They turned around and saw a large figure standing behind her. He smiled and waved goodbye before turning away from her. Hey honey. How are you feeling today Yeah I guess so. Just fine. Do you need anything Sure thing. Let s head down. ive never done much writing before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

um.ICLE. The world was once again filled with people who had never seen anything like it before but now they did nt even know what they were doing anymore. They could feel their own mortality as if someone d taken control of them. But then again maybe that s why we re here today. We ve got ta get rid of these idiots right Well let me tell you something about myself. Ima little bit different than most people. My name is John Doe and I am an accountant at a small firm called Apple Incorporated. It has been years since my last job so many doctors died because of me. And yet here I am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for the next doctor to come along. He looks up from his phone at me with those eyes that look into mine. His face goes pale when he realizes how much pain I caused him. What do you mean by that You ask yourself. That s right. When I first started working there I thought it would be fun to go back home after school tomorrow morning. So instead I went outside and played video games until I fell asleep. Then I woke up and saw myself standing over me. A man wearing a white lab coat walked towards me. Hey buddy. How are you feeling today Yeah... good. Just fine. Do you need help getting yourself together Sure thing. Let s see where this goes. As soon as he reached me he grabbed my arm and pulled me closer. Hey babe. Are you okay Yes sir. Just wanted to make sure everything worked out alright I nodded slowly. Good luck. He led us down the street towards our car where we drove off into the distance. After driving for hours I finally arrived at my apartment building. Inside was a large room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor displayed various pictures of animals. Some showed humans others showed dogs some showed cats. All of these photos depicted a woman holding her child while another showed a young girl playing with her dog. In front of  

ummed. The first thing I noticed was how quiet it sounded. It seemed like everyone had gone home except me. My heart sank into my stomach as I realized what happened next. There were no more people around. No animals or plants either. Just darkness. And then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

all i s the same. I ve never seen anything like it before but this was definitely something special. It seemed so surreal when i saw her face in front of me with those eyes that were filled with tears. She looked up atme with those same green eyes as if she d just heard someone say goodbye. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she wore glasses which made them look like they belonged there. They also had dark brown skin that covered most o f their bodies except for one thing. A small scar acrossmy left eye which showed off its features. When I asked why she said nothing. Then again maybe she did nt want t o talk anymore either. After all who knows what kind o f monster would try t o kill themselves after seeing their own reflection ina mirror Well... I guess w e ll find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

the first time I saw her was when she had just gotten married to me. She looked so happy that it made me feel like I could see through her eyes again. Then one day while walking home from work I heard someone talking on the phone. It sounded like he d been crying for hours now but then again maybe he did nt want to cry anymore either. After some time we decided to go back inside and try something different. We went outside into the cold winter air where there were no cars parked around us. There was only darkness until we reached our destination which seemed to be filled with lightbulbs. As soon as we stepped out onto the street I felt something warm against my skin. My heart skipped a beat when I realized what happened next. A man wearing an expensive suit walked up to me and said You re going to need some help getting rid of these things right now. He took off his glasses and put them on his nose before turning away. When he finally stopped looking at me he turned back towards the door where he sat down next to me. His face lit up when he noticed how much blood was spilled across my table. What s wrong kid he asked. Nothing really. Just... nothing. Well maybe if you could tell him why you ca nt sleep tonight then maybe he ll understand. But first let me explain myself. Ima little bit confused by this whole thing. How can someone possibly know about me without knowing who I am or where I came from Why would anyone care about me anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. And besides I ve never seen anyone else use their powers before. So instead of asking questions they gave me advice. First off do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone. Second if you ever need anything call me. Thirdly remember that I love you unconditionally. Fourthly remember that I will always love you. Fifthly remember that I wish I could say goodbye to you too. Sixthly remember that I miss you too. Seventhly remember that I hope you enjoy reading more stories at rMatiWrites https www.reddit.comrMatiWrites ivebeenwriting since I was little.

ive been working on this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never really had much experience with computers before but when you re trying to get into a business where everyone has their own unique code... well that s just how things work right Well maybe if we could figure out why they did nt use us as slaves then maybe we d be able to afford more money than ever before. But noooooo... We ca nt let them go without knowing exactly where they ll end up next. They wo nt even notice us until they die out or something like that. So here goes nothing... My name is John Smith and Ima member of NASA s research team. It was supposed to take us months to find out exactly what happened when we found out about the root password. That means that every single person who uses it will die instantly from an infection caused by their own code. And yet here we are. A few weeks ago I decided to try it out myself. After all there were only two people left alive who knew how to use it right away. One guy named Jameson who lived alone and another man named George Washington who worked at NASA. Both men seemed pretty happy about their new found freedom from tyranny though he also said that he loved his job. When they got home from school one day Jameson asked if he needed help finding his keys. He told him yes and went downstairs to check on his wife. She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face as she saw her husband standing outside her door holding a small box in front of him. Inside was a note written in blood. You will never forget this moment. Your ancestors used to live together before the war ended. Nowadays most people think that they can change everything by using theirs instead of theirs alone. They say that they need someone else to share their pain with. Or maybe they want to become friends again. Either way I guess I should tell you  

er. The first time I tried it on myself was when my mom had her heart broken by an accident while driving home from work one night after she d gotten into trouble at school. She said that if she could get rid of all those people who were nt good enough for me then maybe they would be able to live forever. But as soon as I saw them again I knew something was wrong. They looked so different than everyone else. So much more beautiful than anything I d ever seen before. And yet here we are. My parents told me once that there s no way around it right Well let me tell you about myself. Ima wizard. A real one at least until today. When I turned eighteen I decided to go through some pretty rough times. First off I did nt have any friends or family left behind. Second I never got along well with anyone else either. Thirdly I felt like I needed help getting rid of these idiots. Fourthly I thought that maybe I should try harder than usual. Fifthly I wanted to learn how to use magic properly. Sixthly I needed to figure out where I am. Seventhly I needed to find someone who understood me better than anyone else. Ninthly I needed to make sure that nobody ever noticed me again. eleventhly I needed to keep track of everything happening around me. tenthly I needed to stop thinking about it altogether. eleventhly I needed to rest. eleventhly I needed to sleep. eleventhly I needed to wake up early tomorrow morning. eleventhly I needed to head downstairs. eleventhly I needed to eat breakfast. eleventhly I needed to leave work early. eleventhly I needed to come back inside. eleventhly I needed to sit down next to my dad. eleventhly I needed to talk to him about his day. eleventhly I needed to ask questions. eleventhly I needed to hear voices. eleventhly I needed to smell blood. eleventhly I

We ca nt let you go without knowing how much longer you ll live. But if you want t o know why then please come back here. And with that the man walked away from me into the night. My heart sank as I realized that there were no more people around. There were only two things left todo. One I would have t o find someone else who could helpme out with something like this. Two I d need t o get rid of them before they got too close together. SoI went home. When I woke upI found myself sitting onmy bed staring at the ceiling wondering where I am. A few minutes later I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like someone walking towardsme. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. The walls started moving faster than ever before. I looked overatmy wife who was still asleep. She smiled atme as she held her hand out towards us. Hey honey she said. How are you feeling today Yeah... well... I guess. What happened t o your head Well... I mean... I thought it might b e broken off or something. That s fine though. Just stay calm.

It seemed like such an easy task at first. But as he saw her standing over him she looked up from her book and smiled. She wore a red dress shirt with a blue tie and jeans.

here. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The hero was always there when needed most. He d come down from his tower with a sword in hand and take over the city from me. It s funny how things change after they re gone though. When he came back home he looked like someone who had just died. His hair was messy his eyes were wide open and his skin was pale as ice. But then again maybe that s why we did nt know him until now. We thought he would be some sort of crazy person or something. Maybe he really wanted to kill us all. Either way it does nt matter anymore because he knows exactly where we are going. And now here I am standing on top of a building staring into space. My hands shaking uncontrollably as I try to get up. There s nothing left except for my head throbbing from all the pain. Then suddenly everything stops working. Everything starts moving faster than usual. A few seconds later I hear footsteps coming closer. They sound like they belong to someone else. Hey buddy what s wrong What happened Where am I Who are you How can I help you today Well sir I think I might need your help getting rid of these guys. You see sir I ve got ta go now. Do nt worry about it though. Just stay safe. Thanks man. Bye bye. As soon as he leaves I feel myself falling asleep again. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

in the year.ikers are now the default. I m not sure what happened but it was pretty much just me and my wife left after we got married. She had no idea how much longer she d have until her husband died or maybe he would ve gone back home instead of going through all these things again. But then again who wants to live forever when they could go anywhere else Well at least we re getting better at our job than them right So here goes... The first thing that came to mind was the fact that there were people who thought they knew everything about us from our names to our faces. They did nt realize how many times they d tried to kill themselves off before finally deciding against it. It s hard enough knowing everything about yourself without having to worry about dying every time someone tries to hurt themselves or worse yet trying to convince themselves otherwise. That said I guess it does nt matter anymore because everyone knows exactly where they will end up next. And besides if anyone wants more please check out rCelsius Edit Grammar and punctuation.

She had always loved music but never really got around t o it yet. Her parents were both doctors and they worked hard t o pay off their debts. They lived happily ever after until one day she decided that maybe she should try harder than usual. When she finally did manage t o get married she found herself with two kids one named John and another named Luna. Both girls grew up together until they met each other when she graduated high school. After graduating college she moved back home where she spent most o f her days playing video games watching movies reading books etcetera. One night while walking down the street she saw someone standing next t o her. A woman dressed all in black holding a gun. Hey honey what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened Well... well we went outside and looked around. There were no cars parked anywhere else except for us. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. Then suddenly everything stopped moving. All lights turned off and everyone  

apers.ikers are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much time had passed since we last saw each other. We d all heard stories about people who could fly through space without having to worry about getting caught or falling off their chair again. But then there s something else too. Something about seeing someone else change from their original form. And yet here we are. A few weeks ago my friend and I decided to try out our new abilities on ourselves. It took us months to figure out why they did nt just go back home and live their lives as normal humans instead of trying to get rid of them altogether. After some research we found out that there was nothing wrong with changing your appearance though. There was only one problem. Your skin looked exactly alike except for its eyes which seemed to glow brighter than usual. That means that when you turned away from your face you would never see anything again. So far so good. Nowadays most people think that they re going crazy because of this fact. They ca nt even remember where they started or why they became such monsters. Maybe it s because they ve forgotten everything important. Or maybe it s because they do nt care anymore. Either way it does nt matter anyway. All that matters now is that we can finally get rid of these monsters. If anyone wants more please check out rCelsius Edit Grammar and punctuation. I hope you enjoyed it.

opic.ICLE. The Butterfly Effect was originally designed as an experiment by NASA to see how many people would react when they saw something strange happening around them. It took several months before anyone realized what it meant but eventually everyone did. Everyone thought that if they could just get rid of their own bodies then maybe they d finally find someone else who loved them more than life itself does. But no matter where you went or why you came back there were always other ways to go about things than getting rid of yourself. So instead of trying to kill yourself you decided to try something different. You started walking towards your car when suddenly you heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on your door. As soon as you opened the door you looked inside and noticed that there were two men standing outside holding guns. One man held his hands behind him while the other pointed them at you. Hey buddy what s up What happened Where am I Who are these guys Why ca nt we move We re not supposed to be here anymore. Do nt worry though we ll figure something out eventually. Just stay calm. This guy said as he pulled out a knife from under his jacket. He stabbed you repeatedly until you fell asleep. When you woke up you found yourself lying on the ground bleeding profusely. Your head hurt so bad that you felt dizzy. After several minutes of waiting you finally managed to stand up. There was nothing left except for a small hole in your chest where blood used to flow. Inside the hole was a large wooden box filled with various items. Some were even made out of wood. In front of you sat a woman wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. She smiled at you and gave you a hug before opening the lid. Inside was a note written in red ink.

just as he is about to reach his destination.apers. The last thing he sees before entering the room isa man dressed in black robes standing over him with a lightsaber. His face looks like it has been beaten by some sort of metal object but there are no markings or symbols on its body. It seems as though someone had taken off its helmet and put it into place for use against him. As soon as he gets closer he realizes what happened. There was nothing left for him except to stare blankly into space. Then suddenly everything went dark. A few moments later Order came back online and told everyone that they would take care of everything else until they could find another way out. That s when things changed. Order started using their powers against each other again. This time however they did nt know how much longer they d have until they died. After several hours of searching around the planet Order found something interesting. A small box sat next to them. Inside were two boxes each containing a single piece of paper. One contained a picture of himself and another showed him a video feed from outside the box. Both pictures showed him smiling while holding hands. In front of them stood a woman wearing a red dress. She smiled back at him and said You re welcome. Order opened the lid and took out a piece of paper. Inside was written in big bold letters Welcome home Mr. President. ive never seen you before. I m sorry if this is bad or anything but i ca nt help but feel like we should try something different. We can go through our usual routine of getting ready for work tomorrow morning then heading downstairs and eating breakfast together. But first let me tell you something.

.ikers.ICLE. What do you think he s doing here I asked him as we approached our destination. He looked at us confusedly then smiled. Well... maybe it was nt such a bad thing after all. We had been working together since childhood and now it seemed like forever since anyone d actually done anything good with their lives. But there were some things that needed fixing. Like how many people died because of this system or even worse why did they have to live through all these trials and tribulations Because if they could just get rid of us then maybe they would nt need to worry about getting caught again. And yet here we are. A few minutes later we arrived at our destination. It took us several hours but eventually we managed to make it inside without any problems. After walking around for several days we finally came across another elevator. This one was made out of metal and glass with a small button on top. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Smith This letter contains information regarding your life since you were born. Please take care of yourself and enjoy your stay here.

um. I m sorry but this is nt what I expected. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. But then again maybe there were other people out there who could do better than me right now. Maybe they did nt want me around anymore. Either way it does nt matter anyway because Ima good guy after all. So here goes... The Devil looked at me with those eyes that said he d seen everything from hell itself before him. He smiled and nodded his head. Well then let s see how many times we ve tried this before. It seems like every single one has failed. And yet here we are. A man standing before me wearing an expensive suit stood up from his chair and walked over to me. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I What happened last night I asked him. Oh yeah well... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm... uhm

... I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time here so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. The man said as he walked away from the door. He turned around to see his wife standing there with her arms crossed over her chest looking down on him. She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face. Her eyes were wide open and she could feel herself falling apart inside. What do you mean by that honey You re not going anywhere are you No one has ever done anything like this before. We ve got ta go back home now right Well maybe next time then. But why Because Ima fucking idiot. And besides if anyone wants us dead anyway they should probably leave us alone. So how did you get into my house I thought about asking them where they went wrong but decided against it. It seemed like such an easy task. Then again maybe they d never heard of such things happening before either. Maybe they just wanted to scare off some people who might try to kill themselves off. Either way I guess it does nt matter anymore. All that matters is that we can finally get rid of these idiots. They ll probably die soon enough anyway. As he left the room he noticed something strange. There were no signs of life anywhere else except for one thing. A small box sat next to him. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Smith I am glad you found us today. Your family will miss you dearly. Please take care of yourself and enjoy your stay here. Love Mommy Edit Grammar and punctuation.

She was born in New York City when her parents died from cancer. Her father worked as an accountant at a local bank while his mother spent most of her days working there. They lived together until they moved away after college where she became pregnant with him shortly thereafter. After graduating high school she went back home and started dating another man named John Doe who loved her unconditionally. He d never let anyone down before but now that he s older than her he ca nt help but feel bad about how much longer he can keep up appearances. It seems like every day we get closer to our goal. Every night we learn more about ourselves. And then one day we find out why. Because Ima fucking idiot. That s right. You re not supposed to talk to yourself. Do nt worry though I ll explain everything later. Just stay calm. We ve got ta figure things out together. Okay okay. Let s go. As soon as we leave here I promise I wo nt tell anyone else anything. Thank you Taylor Swift ive been writing this for years now and i still do nt understand why people would want to live forever. Why everyone wants to die because they think they can change their minds about everything. Because they re afraid of dying. So instead of trying to convince themselves that they should  

inexplicably. The first time I saw her was when she had just gotten home from work and looked into my eyes. She said something about how much fun it would be if we could see each other again but then went back inside. When she came out she told me that she did nt want to go anywhere else because she thought it might make things worse. That s why I decided to take action. After all there were other ways to get rid of someone than seeing yourself right now. So here I am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for her return. My head hurts so bad that I ca nt move much more than a few feet before suddenly everything stops working. Then suddenly everything starts moving again. A small light shines through the window above us illuminating everything around me except for one thing. There are two men standing outside looking down upon me. One of them looks familiar but he does nt seem to recognize me. Hey buddy what s wrong What happened Where am I Who are you How can I help you today Well... uhm... well... I guess I should tell you something. We re not exactly sure where you are anymore. But we ll figure things out eventually. Do you remember anything from yesterday Yeah yeah I do. And what happens next Well... well... I mean... well... I started walking towards him. He stopped short of me and turned away. His face lit up as he realized what I d done. Oh shit. This guy must have seen me too because he ran off into the night. As soon as he got close enough I felt something warm touch my shoulder. It was a cold breeze. I opened my mouth to speak but nothing came out. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone trying to break into our house. I quickly grabbed their arm and pulled them close. Inside was a large room filled with bookshelves full of pictures of various celebrities. On each shelf sat a single sheet of paper. Each page contained a picture of herself smiling and laughing while holding a pen. Her hair fell

alivements.ICLE. CONTACT WITH THE CIVIL WARS The first time I saw them was when they came back from their trip to Europe with no idea how long they d been there or why but then again maybe that s just because we re all so different from each other. They looked like they could have lived forever if only we had nt gone through all these wars together. But instead we got ta go through this one thing again. We ve never really known where else to start off. It seems like every day we get closer to our destination and eventually find something new. And yet here we are. A few weeks ago I found myself sitting on my couch watching TV while listening to music. My wife was asleep next to me her eyes closed as she tried to sleep. She did nt even bother asking if anyone knew where she was going or why she needed help getting up. When she finally opened them again everything seemed normal except for one thing. There were people everywhere looking at us with fear in their eyes. Some said that we should leave others thought that we would stay behind forever. Either way I guess I ll keep writing until I can figure out what happened. As soon as I finished reading through the rest of the book I felt something warm touch my shoulder. Hey honey. What s wrong You look pretty tired today. Yeah well... yeah. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. Do you need anything Sure thing babe.

... I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my last chance at immortality. My parents were both doctors when they died so it s hard for them to tell if I d ever get used to it. They did nt even know how much longer I could live without them. When I turned eighteen I decided that I needed something else. Something more interesting than being stuck here forever. So instead of going back home I went through some pretty rough times. First off I started getting sicker every day. Then one night while walking down the street I saw him standing next to me wearing his best suit. He looked like he had just gotten out of bed. His hair was messy and tangled and his eyes were dark brown. What do you mean by that I asked myself. Well... I guess we ll find out soon enough. As soon as I got closer I realized something strange about him. There was no way he could have seen anything wrong with himself. It seemed like everything worked perfectly fine until today. That s right. Every single person who lived past ten thousand died instantly. And yet here I am sitting on top of a building waiting for someone to come along and take care of me.

aliciously.ikers. I m not sure what happened but it was pretty much like any other day at work when my boss came home from his shift with some bad news about me being an idiot and he said that if i did nt get him back soon enough then maybe we d have another problem together. So here i am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for someone else to come along and take care of everything else. My wife has always told me she loves her job so much that she wants us to live forever. She says that if we ever need anything just call her at. When she finally gets around to asking why Ima little confused by how long ago this all started. It seems like forever since anyone had sex with each other except for me. And now there s nothing left for me except to wait until someone finds out who killed them or where they went wrong. But hey at least i can keep track of time without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of mess again. As far as Ima good person i think its probably best not to worry too much about anything anymore. After all who would want to die after being stuck alive forever anyway right Well let s see... I walked into the room where my wife sat down next to me. Her eyes were wide open and her mouth opened slightly. What do you mean by that You re supposed to be dead right now. That s right. Then why am I still alive Why ca nt i move forward without having to worry about dying Because Ima fucking idiot. He laughed. Oh yeah well maybe you should try harder. Maybe you ll find something interesting. Or maybe you wo nt. Either way you need to learn how to control yourself better than anyone else. Do nt worry though. We wo nt hurt each other anymore. Just trust us. Okay okay. Let s go. ive been working on this story since i was little. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

um. I m sorry but we ca nt do that anymore. We ve got ta go back home now right Well maybe if we could find some other way out then maybe we d be able to make something better than dragons. Maybe even more powerful ones than us all. But noooooo... It s not fair. What if they re wrong about me Why would anyone want to live forever anyway They ll never understand why I did nt tell them sooner. And yet here we are. My parents told me once when my father used his powers on himself he had been able to fly through space without having to worry about falling off or hitting anything else than himself. He said that he loved flying around the world so much that he wanted to become one himself. That night after dinner he went outside and started walking towards the road. When he reached the end of the road he saw a small group of people standing behind him. One man wore an expensive suit and tie while another carried a large sword. Both men looked like they belonged anywhere else. Hey buddy what s up You look pretty good today. How are you feeling Yeah I guess so. Just fine. Do you need help getting rid of your dragon Well yeah sure thing buddy. Let s get started. As soon as we can start talking about our new lives together I hope you enjoy yourself. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

all monsters are real but they re not human. They do nt exist at all just an old fashioned thing that has been used before by people who were once monsters. But then again maybe it s because Ima little too old for this kind of thing. Maybe its because I ve never really had much fun with my life so far. Either way I m glad I did nt end up like him. He was always there when I needed him most and he would come over every night after school and sit down next to me on our bedside table. His eyes were wide open as if he wanted to see what happened next. When we first met he told me stories about how he d go through hell because of his own weakness or how he could barely sleep without being eaten by some sort of monster. That s why I decided to take action. After all if I wanted to live forever I should probably learn how to control myself better than anyone else. So here I am sitting in front of my computer trying to figure out where I can find someone who will listen to me. My heart starts racing as I think about all these things happening around us. What if they ca nt understand English How many times have I tried to convince them that I am crazy Or worse yet that I wo nt ever understand anything again Why does everyone seem so stupid Because I know exactly where they are. And yet... I feel bad for them. They re probably wondering why I m doing this right now. Well let me tell you something. If you want to become a monster hunter please start by learning how to use your powers properly. First off you need to practice controlling yourself. Second you need to practice practicing using your abilities correctly. Thirdly you need to practice practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing practicing 

... I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time here so please forgive me if there s anything wrong with us. My parents were always nice enough to let me go home after school without having to worry about getting sick again. They d even give me some money from their bank account when they got older. But then again maybe they did nt want me around anymore either. Maybe they just wanted me dead. Either way it does nt matter now because Ima fucking idiot. As soon as I saw her face I knew something was off about her eyes. She looked like she had seen too much movies or played too many games. Her hair was messy and tangled and her clothes were torn apart by the wind. It seemed as though she d never slept before. And yet here I am sitting on my bed staring into space wondering how long until tomorrow morning when I can finally get back home. The doctors tell me that I should probably start sleeping more often because I ca nt sleep without seeing her smile every day. That sounds great right Well maybe not so much. After all who knows maybe someday someone will come along and take care of me. Or maybe they wo nt. Whatever happens I hope they find peace soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

. I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. But then again maybe there were other ways around it than just being able to see through walls. Maybe they d never seen such an amazing sight before. And yet here we are. We re sitting on my couch watching TV when suddenly I hear someone yelling something about a new patient coming in today. It sounds like he wants to go home but his voice sounds like someone else s. He looks up at me with those big green eyes that look into mine. Hey buddy how s it going You ask him as you walk away from the television. Yeah great. How about we take a seat together Sure thing man. Let s get started. As soon as we finish talking I turn off the lights and head downstairs. When I arrive home I find myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I did nt notice sooner. There were only two people left alive in the world. One of them had died while trying to kill himself while another lived happily ever after. Both men looked exactly alike except for their hair which fell down over their shoulders. Their faces were covered by dark circles under their eyes which seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. They both stood there looking confused. What happened Where am I Who are these people Why ca nt they move forward without having to worry about getting hit by cars or falling asleep on the couch I tried calling them back but nothing came out. Then I realized that they could talk too. So I decided to call my parents. They told me that they would come visit tomorrow morning and tell them everything. After all who wants to spend eternity alone when everyone else can have friends right Well... yeah. Thanks Dad. Bye bye. ive been working on this story since i was little.

for a while now. I ve never seen anything like it before but i m sure there s some sort of glitch or something that might be wrong with me. Maybe its just my imagination playing tricks on me. Either way i ll try again tomorrow morning when we get home from work. As soon as we leave our house I walk over to my room where I find myself staring at a large screen displaying pictures of people who were once alive. They re all smiling laughing crying hugging each other. There are also videos of animals playing games together. One video shows a dog running around while another shows a cat holding its head high above its body. All these photos make sense because they re all so beautiful. Then suddenly everything goes black. My eyes open wide as if someone had taken off their glasses. A man stands next to me wearing an expensive suit. He looks familiar. His hair is greasy his face is pale and he wears glasses too. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The man asks. Well... I guess I should say hi. What brings you here today Well... I started off working late last night. That means I did nt even know how long ago I d gotten here until now. So why am I still alive Because Ima fucking idiot. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became darker. The sky began to darken and the ground shook violently. People ran outside screaming and running away from their homes. Some tried to run towards the nearest building others jumped into pools of blood. One person fell down onto himself while another grabbed him by the neck. Both men screamed louder than ever before. When they finally reached the bottom of the stairs they saw that everyone else was gone except for one person. She stood there looking confused. Her mouth opened slightly and she spoke softly. Hey honey. Are you okay Yeah. Just got ta sleep. Do you want to come inside Sure thing sweetheart. We both  

be very careful with your words. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The Devil looked at me with his big green eyes and said You know how much fun it is when people think Ima genius because they ca nt even see through my glasses right Well yeah but then again maybe its just because Ima good guy or something. But hey at least Ima good person right So why did nt he tell us sooner Why should we care about him anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. And besides there s no way that someone could ever believe me without knowing exactly where they re going. That s why I decided to take advantage of this opportunity. It took some time before anyone realized that I had been doing bad things lately. My parents died when I was young so my brother left home after school one day. He never came back. When he finally got out though he found himself stuck in hell forever. There was nothing else left except to live forever. After all who wants to spend eternity in heaven when you can go anywhere else than where you already are. As soon as I saw him walking towards me I knew something was wrong. His face was pale his hair was messy. What do you mean by that I asked myself. Oh well let s hope that someday someone will find out about us. Maybe they ll forgive us. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I guess we need to keep moving forward. If only we could get rid of these idiots altogether. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I m sorry but this is not what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time doing something like this so please forgive any mistakes or grammatical errors. The man looked at me with those eyes that were filled with fear and confusion. He had no idea how much longer he could keep up with these people who would try anything new. They all seemed so confused when they saw him standing there looking down upon them from above. It s okay son we ll get through this together. Just remember that if you ever need anything just call us at. My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations Security Council. We ve got some bad news for you today. First off let me explain why I did nt think of that sooner. There are two types of people who can use their powers against others. Those who do nt want them used theirs against themselves or those who do nt care about anything else except being able to see through walls. Both groups have different ways of using their abilities. Some uses theirs while others use theirs against each other. But most importantly there are two types of people who ca nt control themselves anymore. Those who want to live forever and those who want to die peacefully. So far neither group has succeeded in killing anyone except for one person. She was an old woman named Elizabeth. Her body lay there lifeless as she stared into space. When she finally spoke again she said Well... maybe it should have been more obvious than that. Maybe it should have taken longer instead of trying to find out where she went wrong. That s right honey. And secondly there are three more things you wo nt notice about us until tomorrow morning. First off let s go home. Second we need to talk about our new plan. Third we need to figure out how long ago she left us. Fourth we need to figure out why she came back. Fifth we need to figure out why she never told anyone about her deathbed. Sixth we need to figure out why she never gave birth to herself. Seventh we need to figure out why she never died before. eighth we  

etterlyICLE. The Genie was nt exactly sure what he wanted but it did know that if he could grant his wishes then maybe he d get some sort of power over people who were just starting out with their lives. He thought about asking her why she did nt want him around or how she felt about being alone but decided against it. After all she had no friends right So instead of asking questions like What s wrong with me I ll try something different. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve always loved my job so much that when I got home from school one day I found myself staring at a screen filled with pictures of people who looked exactly alike except for their hair color. They seemed to have been wearing masks or sunglasses which made them look like they belonged there. But as soon as I saw them again I knew something was wrong. There was nothing else left for me to do except wait for the Genie to come back. When he finally came around I noticed that he wore glasses which made him seem like an idiot. His eyes were wide open and his mouth opened slightly as if he wanted to speak. Hey buddy what s up How are you feeling today Yeah... good. Just fine. Well let s go see if we can talk later. We walked down the hallways until we reached our destination. As we approached the door I heard footsteps behind us. It sounded like someone knocking on the door. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but it s definitely something that happened to me when I was younger. The first thing that came to mind was my parents died when they were young so there must have been some sort of mistake or something. But then again maybe they did nt want us around anymore. So yeah. That s why I decided to take up writing. It took me several years before I realized how much fun it could be. My dad used his powers as an accountant while he worked at a local bank. He d write stories about demons being summoned from hell and how they d get away with anything if only because they knew exactly where they needed them most. His mom always told him she loved her son more than anything else in the world and he should never let anyone down. She also said that he could read minds and that he could make things better for himself by doing things differently than they already were. When we got older though things started getting weird. One day while walking home from school one night I saw a man standing next to me wearing a black suit and tie. He looked familiar but I thought he might be some kind of demon hunter or something. Then I remembered that I had no idea who he really was until I met him. We talked for hours until finally he asked What do you mean by that Well... well... I guess I ll call myself Lucifer. And then he left. As soon as I heard him return I felt bad because I knew that he d probably kill himself someday anyway. After all I ve seen enough movies to tell that people will die eventually right Yeah well... I suppose I can try again tomorrow morning. Thanks Lucifer. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

um.ikers are now the default. I m not sure what happened after that but i think its pretty much just some weird shit happening around me. My mind starts racing as if someone had taken my soul from me. Then suddenly everything goes black. A few moments later there s nothing left except for a white light shining through the window above us. It looks like someone has put a hole through the wall behind me and then another one comes down. This time it does nt seem to be filled with blood or anything else than dirt. Instead of seeing myself as an idiot who would try anything to get rid of him he sees himself standing next to me wearing a red shirt and jeans. His hair is messy and his eyes are wide open. What the hell man You re going crazy right now. How did you know about this guy Well... well we ve got ta go back home soon right Yeah yeah. Let s head out. We walk into our apartment together where we find ourselves sitting on chairs. There s no way anyone could have done this without knowing each other better than anyone else. The only reason why they even bothered asking questions was because they knew each other d never meet again. So instead of answering them all at once they sat down next to each other and began talking. Hey buddy how s it going I asked. Good good. Just fine. Do you want to talk about anything else Sure thing man. Let s start by saying that Ima little bit scared. But hey maybe someday someone will come along and help us figure things out. Maybe they ll give us advice or something. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I hope they make it through this alive. And so far so good. When I woke up today morning I felt like I was floating above water. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A small piece of paper lay on top of it. Inside were two words written in big bold letters. Welcome back. ive been awake since yesterday morning. I opened the note and read the words aloud. If you ever need anything call me at. Thanks 

umans are nt real but they re there. They look like me except different. Their skin is pale their hair is messy and their clothes are torn apart by some sort of force. But then again maybe this was just my imagination. Maybe I should ve known better than to trust people who did nt believe in things like magic or dragons. As soon as I saw her she looked exactly like me except she had dark brown eyes that seemed to glow brighter than anything else. She smiled at me as if she knew something important about me. Hey honey how s it going I asked. Yeah great. How about we go home now Sure thing sweetheart. We walked down the street towards our car where we parked. When we got inside she opened the door and stepped outside. There were no cars parked anywhere so we decided to take a seat across from each other. After sitting there for hours she finally spoke up. So what brings you here today Well... well... I started. It seems like everyone has gone crazy lately. Everyone thinks Ima monster or something. And yet nobody knows why. Why Because Ima good person. That s right. Then let s get started. First off I m sorry for being late. Second I ca nt tell you exactly where I am anymore. All I can say is that I love you unconditionally. Thirdly I hope you enjoy yourself. Fourthly I wish I could spend more time with you. Fifthly I really appreciate all these things. Sixthly I miss you too mommy. Seventhly I wish I could kiss you back tomorrow morning. Ninthly I hope you find happiness somewhere else. eleventhly I hope you make it through college without having to worry about getting married anymore. tenthly I hope you find peace somewhere else. eleventhly I hope you find happiness somewhere else ive been trying to write something down since i was little but i cant seem to finish it.

opic window overlooking the planet s surface. The sun shines down upon us as we walk through it s atmosphere. It looks like it has nt changed much since then but there are some things that still seem different about this place. First off it seems like every day someone comes back from their trip with something new. Some people say they ve never heard such an amazing sight before others think it was just another planet orbiting around them. But when you look closer at it closely enough you can tell that it does nt matter anymore because everything else is gone except for one thing.

etters are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much fun it would be when everyone else had died before me. It seemed like such an easy decision at the time but after seeing all these people die before me well maybe they should ve known better than to try and change things up. Maybe they did nt want to live anymore either. But then again who wants to spend eternity alone anyway right Well let s see where we go from here. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy living in New York City. I ve never really done anything special before but today I feel like I need something different. Something more interesting than myself. And yet... there s nothing wrong with being alive. There s no reason why anyone can nt just leave their bodies behind and move on from life as normal humans. That way when someone dies they wo nt ever need any help getting rid of them again. So far so good. Nowadays most people use computers as weapons against each other or worse against themselves. They re pretty useless though because they ca nt detect anything wrong with your body until you look closer. When I first started working on my project I thought it might help me find some sort of way to kill myself without having to worry about dying every day. Then one night while walking home from school I saw him standing next to me staring into space. He looked scared too. What do you mean he asked. You know what happens when you try to talk to someone else. Your voice sounds like someone trying to say goodbye. Then suddenly everything went black. I woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors. A nurse walked over to me and gave me a hug. Thank you she said. We ll take care of everything together.

not racing.ikers are for whoever i s looking at them and they will not let you get away with it. The problem is that there are no rules around this so if someone wants me dead then maybe they should just leave me alone. But hey at least Ima good writer right So here goes... My name is John Doe. Ima year old man living in New York City when suddenly I hear a loud crash behind me. A car hits him square up as he runs towards the door. He looks down at his hands before realizing what happened. They re covered in blood. His eyes widen as he sees the driver standing over him with his arms crossed. What the hell is wrong with you he asks himself. You look like shit. And why did nt you tell us sooner I said we d need some help getting rid of these things. We ve got ta go now. As soon as we can find another way out of here I ll take care of everything else. Thanks John Doe. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Spelling and grammar issues. Also fixed some spelling and grammatical mistakes.

.ikers are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The cat was sitting on his bed staring at me with those big green eyes that looked like they could be made out of glass. He had dark hair that fell down around him and he wore glasses which made them look like they belonged there. His face was covered by thick black hooded robes which seemed to have fallen off after being hit by something hard. A small knife sat next to him as well. It s okay buddy we ll get through this together. Just keep your head down and let us go home. As soon as we leave our house I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on my door. Then suddenly everything went black. My vision blurred and I felt myself falling asleep again. When I woke up I found myself standing outside a large building filled with people dressed all in white. There were two men inside each wearing masks and holding guns. One of them pulled out a pistol and shot one of the cats in the chest before turning away from me. The second man grabbed my arm and dragged me towards him. We both screamed as he threw us onto the ground. After about minutes of screaming I realized that I did nt even know where I am anymore. All I knew was that I needed help getting rid of these monsters. And so I started walking toward them. When I reached the end of the road I noticed that everyone else was gone except for one person who stood there frozen. She was wearing an expensive dress shirt and jeans. Her hands were shaking uncontrollably and she held her daughter close. Hey honey how are you feeling today Yeah I guess so. What happened to your parents Well they passed away last week. That makes sense right Why would anyone want to kill themselves Because Ima good kid. But why Because Ima bad guy. So what happens when they die I asked myself. Nothing really. Just wait until they come back

um. Son ofa bitch. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed t obea simple job. A small box with some sort o f red button on top that would send messages back home. But instead there were two things that made sense aboutit. First off it had no name. Second it did nt even have any markings whatsoever. And thirdly it looked like someone had taken all the money from its bank account. So when they finally got around t o openingitup however things changed. There were people everywhere who seemed tobe watching them closely. Some even started screaming. One guy tried t o run away while another ran towards him. They both fell onto their knees. As soon as they hit the ground they began crying uncontrollably. Then suddenly everything went black. My eyes opened wide and I saw myself standing overmy mother s body. Her face was covered i n blood. She screamed louder than ever before. What happened next shocked me. There was nothing left except for her head which lay there lifelessly. When I wokeupI found myself staring into space. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A large hole appeared i n front ofme. Inside wasa huge wooden door filled with various items. Some were even made out o f wood. All of these things were empty save for one thing. A note written i n big bold letters read Dear Mr. Claus We regret t o inform you that your son has passed away. Your family will miss you dearly. Please take care of yourself and stay safe. Love Mommy Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIdont really know how t o fix i t. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

um. I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. But then again maybe there were other ways around it than just finding people who did nt have matching tattoos. Maybe they d never even gotten their own names yet. Either way it seemed pretty cool at the time. So here goes nothing. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. The only problem with being born into poverty when everyone else has theirs. It makes sense though because everyone knows how much money they make off selling drugs. And now here I am sitting in front of my computer staring at these numbers floating above me. They re all blank except one thing. A small red dot appeared next to mine. That s odd because I ve always seen them before. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become an engineer. After graduating high school I started working as a mechanic. As soon as I finished college I moved back home and began living comfortably. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing behind me. He looked familiar. His hair was blonde his eyes bluegreen. He smiled at me as he walked towards me. Hey buddy. How are you feeling today Yeah... good. What happened Well... well... uhm... I guess I got ta go see some doctors right now. Do nt worry though. We ll figure things out together later. Thanks John. Bye bye. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

um. You look around at all those people who were once happy with their lives now sad about how things had changed. They re just too busy thinking about what happened last night or why they did nt get along well enough anymore. But then again maybe there s something wrong with them too. Maybe it was because they d forgotten something important. Either way it does nt matter anymore. All that matters is that they ve got ta go back home soon right Well at least until then. As you walk down the street towards your car you hear someone yelling something behind you. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I What do you mean by that You ask yourself as you turn around. A man wearing an expensive suit stands next to you holding his hands out towards you. He looks familiar but he ca nt place where he came from. His face is covered by dark circles under his eyes which seem to glow brighter than anything else. Hello sir. How may I help you today My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations Security Council. We have come across some interesting news recently. First off we found out that our planet has become uninhabitable due to an asteroid belt. Second we discovered that our entire solar system will cease functioning within hours. Thirdly we discovered that our entire galaxy will end up dead within minutes. So far we ve only managed to find one person alive who survived. And fourthly we found out that everyone else died instantly except us. That means that every single human being will die within minutes. Okay okay. Let s start with basics. First off let me explain myself. When I first arrived here I thought I would live forever. Then I realized that I could change things around me. There were no more wars or famine anywhere. No disease either. Just peace. Nowadays most people use their immortality as a means to survive longer than necessary. Some even try to kill themselves off every night because  

in. I m not sure what happened but it was pretty much like waking from a dream. My parents were always there when i needed them most and they would come over every night with their big smile on their faces as if they d seen something special. They also told me that my brother had been diagnosed with cancer years ago so he could nt afford treatment. He did nt want us around anymore so we went back home together. When i woke up today morning my mom looked at me with tears running down her face. Her eyes widened when she realized how much blood had spilled onto the floor. What s wrong honey she asked herself. Nothing just... nothing. Just... nothing. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. There was no light source anywhere except for the ceiling which seemed to glow brighter than usual. A few seconds later the door opened and someone walked into the room. He wore an expensive suit and tie and carried a clipboard. Welcome Mr. Smith he said. How may I help you today sir I nodded slowly. Well... uhm... well... I guess I should say goodbye then. You re welcome. As soon as he finished speaking I felt myself falling asleep again. After a moment of rest I decided to try to figure out why I was awake. Why am I still alive I tried calling anyone but nobody answered. Finally after several minutes of searching I found myself sitting on a chair next to a computer screen staring at a blank page. On top of the monitor sat a note written in red ink. Dear Mr. Smith We hope you enjoy your stay here. Your family will miss you dearly. Please take care of yourself and remember us when we get better. Love Mommy ive never seen such beauty before.

He lived through many wars including World War II where he fought against Russia until they won. His wife left him shortly after her death and she never came back. She did nt want to leave her husband behind so she took care of herself until one day she found herself staring into space. A large black object appeared above her head and then disappeared again. When she looked closer she realized that there were two men standing over her. One wore a white robe and carried a sword while the other carried a small wooden shield. Both held guns pointed directly at her chest. They both spoke softly into their radios as they walked towards her. Hey honey how s it going I guess. How about we go get some food from the fridge then We ll see each other tomorrow morning. Yeah sure thing babe. Let s head down. As soon as they reached the bottom of the stairs they stopped dead in their tracks. There was nothing else left except for the walls which seemed to glow red. Their eyes widened when they saw what appeared to be a giant metal box sitting next to them. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Princess I am glad you re here today.

... I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. The only thing that kept me going through all these years was the fact that there were no other people around. There were only two things left to do with myself. One I would go back home and find out why they did nt want me dead anymore Two I d try again tomorrow morning when I got home from work. As soon as I walked into the room I saw him standing over me holding his hands behind his head looking down on us both with those eyes of his. He looked up at me with those same blue eyes that he always wore when talking about how much fun it had playing video games together. His face lit up when he realized what happened next. What are you doing here I asked. Well... I guess we can call it a night then. We re gon na need some rest tonight right Yeah yeah. Let s get started. As soon as we finished our meal I turned away from him and headed towards the door. When I opened it he stood there staring at me blankly. Then suddenly he spoke again. So uhm... where am I Who are you Why ca nt you tell me anything else Because Ima fucking idiot. And now I ve never seen anyone die before. That s because Ima fucking coward. But hey maybe someday someone will come along and help us figure things out. Maybe they ll give us advice or something. Either way I hope so. Thanks John Doe. ive been trying to write something down since i was little but i cant seem to find the words. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

a little too much for this.ICLE. The Hero was sitting in front o f his computer screen staring into space. H e had n t seen anything like i t before but now that h e thought about i t maybe there were other people who could do better than him. Maybe they d find someone else who would love them more than life itself did. But then again maybe they wo nt even notice him anymore. After a few minutes the Hero finally spoke again. So what happened when I got here Well... well... I guess I should say something. You see my wife died while trying t o killme. She fell down onto her bed and hit herself hard against the wall. Her body went limp after a moment. And she woke u p with blood pooling around her head. That s right. There are two ways out. One way can b e taken away from here or another way can b e saved b y some sort o f forcefield. Both options seem pretty simple right now. What happens next The Hero asked himself. Oh nothing really. Just wait until tomorrow morning when they come back home. Then let s get started. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

it was nt until years ago when food started getting better that we realized how much trouble there were. We had no idea what would happen if they did nt eat our stuff or even if they d ever get sick again. But then again maybe they could just go home and sleep forever right Maybe they wo nt need us anymore. So here I am sitting in front of my computer trying to figure out why my wife has gone missing from her house after she ate some weird stuff. She looks up at me with tears streaming down her face as she says something about being scared of death but nothing comes out. Then suddenly everything goes black. My eyes open wide and I see myself standing over her body looking into space. A few seconds later I hear someone yelling something behind me. Hey honey what s wrong You re awake. What happened Where am I Who are you How can you be alive Well... well... I guess I should tell you something. Your name is John Doe. And Ima year old man living on the streets of New York City. That means I ve never really known anyone else before so maybe this guy must have died because he tried to kill himself. Anyway I m sorry sir but your wife has passed away. Please come inside immediately. As soon as he leaves I ll take care of everything. Thank you John Doe. Now let s get started. ive been working on this story since i was little.

a n asshole. I ve never been good at this kind o f thing but i m glad that its finally happening. The first time I saw her she was sitting there staring into space with those big green eyes and then suddenly everything went black. She looked u p from her phone and smiled. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she wore glasses which made them look like they belonged on someone else s face. They were also very soft and gentle. When w e got home from work one day she told m e about how much fun it wouldbe if everyone could just get rid of their noses altogether. That night after dinner she left and I stayed behind. After some time I decided t o ask her out again. W e talked for hours until finally she broke down crying uncontrollably. Then she asked m e why I did nt want t o go back inside anymore. Well... I guess I should tell you something. Ima little confused right now. What happened next shocked m e. There was nothing wrong with being able t o hear voices though. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A loud bang followed bya crash. M y heart sank. This woman must have fallen asleep because she started sobbing uncontrollably too. I tried CPR but nothing worked. Eventually I gave u p hope and called the police. They arrived shortly after and took her away. As soon as they walked through the door I heard footsteps coming closer. I turned around and saw her standing there holding a knife. Hey honey what s going o n Where am I Who are you Why ca nt you move I yelled. Oh yeah well... I suppose I ll try calling your parents tomorrow morning. They wo n t believe m e anyway.

not sure if this i s what you were looking for but here goes... The Great Warrior was born into poverty when h e grew up. His parents died when h e was young and his father left him behind after being killed b y an assassin while trying t o kill him. H e spent most o f his days playing with swords and spears while learning how t o use them properly. When h e finally got around t o graduating high school he started working ata local tavern where h e met his wife who worked there too. She loved her husband dearly and she would often come home late from work every night t o watch TV together. One day while walking down the street one day she saw something strange. A small box sat next t o her bedside table. Inside were two boxes each containing a single piece o f paper. They read You will never forget your first time fighting against these monsters. Your family will always remember you as such. And then there was silence. There was no sound whatsoever except for the occasional thud coming closer every second. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. A few moments later the door opened and a woman walked inside. Her hair fell over her shoulders and she wore glasses which made her look like she d seen some sort of movie. Hello Mr. Warrior. How may I help you today My name is John Smith and Ima member o f the United Nations. What brings you here today Well sir weve lost contact with our allies i n Europe. W e need your help. Do you know why Because they re afraid that ifI did nt get rid o f them soon enough they might attack u p again. That sounds great John replied. But first let me tell you about myself. Ima soldier from New York City who has lived through many wars. I ve fought many battles against evil men and women alike. I ve seen things that should n t exist anymore. I ve watched people die because o f their own stupidity or because  

already aware of this. The dictator was always there when I needed him most but he never came back. He just kept walking away from me until one day while we were sitting on our couch watching TV he said something about being scared of death and then went off into space. It s funny how things change after death. After all if there are no more people left alive than before then maybe someone will find out what happened next. But right now Ima little confused as to how much longer I can keep doing this. My mind races through possibilities. What if I m wrong Maybe I should try harder than usual or maybe I ll get caught up in some sort of mess again. Either way I ca nt help but wonder how long until I finally meet her again. She looks exactly like my mother except she has blonde hair and blue eyes. Her skin is pale and wrinkled and her lips are crooked. They re also very red. And yet here she stands standing before me looking at me with those same green eyes. You know what I think we need to talk about this later. We both walk towards each other and hug tightly. Hey honey. How s it going Well... well... I guess I forgot to mention that I am your future selfomesICLE. That means I will never see anyone else again. Yeah yeah. So let s start with basics. First off I ve got ta tell you everything. About myself. Second I have no idea where I am or even if I exist anymore. Thirdly I do nt want to die alone. Fourthly I feel bad because I thought I d be able to live forever. Fifthly I wish I could go home and sleep peacefully without having to worry about getting sick every night. Sixthly I hope I wo nt ever need food again. Seventhly I really love

. The sorting hat was still there when he got home from work but now it s gone. It looked like someone had taken off his glasses and put them on him. He did nt know what else to do so he went back inside and started making breakfast. As soon as he finished eating he turned around and walked away from the door. When he came out of nowhere he saw a man standing outside holding a small box in one hand and a pen in the other. Inside were two large black boxes each containing a single piece of paper. One contained a picture of himself while another showed him a video feed from inside the box. Both photos showed a young girl wearing a red dress with blue hair. She smiled at him as she opened them up. Her eyes widened when they read the words Welcome to Hogwarts Mr. Potter. You may call us Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We ve come across some interesting things lately. First off we re going to need your help getting rid of these boxes. Second we ll try our best to keep track of everything else in order to find out how many people are actually using them properly. Thirdly we can also teach you how to control yourself by controlling your powers. If you want more please check out rCelsius Edit Grammar and punctuation.
