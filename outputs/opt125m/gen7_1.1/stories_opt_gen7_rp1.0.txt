...awning. The crowd roared as they watched him walk away from the stage with a large hat on top. They were all excited about what would happen next but then again they did nt really care much for movies anyway. It seemed like every time someone tried to make a movie about Leonardo DiCaprio being a hero or something like that he d just end up getting worse. But when you re doing this you ca nt help but wonder how many people will actually listen to you when you say that. So here we are. A few minutes later Leonardo DiCaprio walked into the room where he sat down on the couch. His eyes widened as he saw the man standing there looking at him with those same blue eyes that he always wore when he went through trouble. What do you want from me sir asked the man. Well... I guess I ll give you one last chance. You can go home now. We ve got ta talk about our new found freedom. Leonardo said as he took off his glasses. As soon as he opened them the door slammed shut behind him. A woman stood there holding her hands up in front of her face. She smiled at him and gave him a reassuring hug before walking towards the exit. When she reached the end of the road she stopped dead in her tracks. Her head hurt so bad that she could barely move. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. There was nothing left except for a single light shining through the window above her. It shone brightly through the glass and made Leonardo feel uneasy. This must be some kind of joke. Maybe it s actually true. After all if so why should I care about anyone else anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. And besides I m not even sure if I can handle being around these idiots anymore. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

um. The war was over when they first arrived on Earth but now there s nothing left for them here except to live in peace with each other until they find another planet where they can get along without having to worry about dying again. They had no idea what would happen if they did nt make it back alive or even worse yet dying from disease. But then again maybe they should ve known better than to try and escape their own solar system. Maybe they thought that if they went through with this plan they d never see another human being again. Either way it seemed like such an easy decision at the time. After all who wants to die when you can just go outside and play video games until your eyes burn from the light of the sun That s why I decided to take advantage of my gift. My parents told me stories about how their ancestors used to fight against other races before they even knew how to use guns. How they used to use swords too. And how one day while playing some sort of game called Call of Duty one of them fell down onto his head. He looked up at me with tears streaming down his face as he tried to stand up. His body went limp after several minutes of falling. When he came back into view he saw me standing there staring at him with wide eyes. What happened next shocked him. There were two men sitting across from each other holding guns. One man pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the chest. Another man grabbed my arm and dragged me towards him. We fought for hours until finally we reached our destination. As soon as we stepped inside I felt something warm touch my shoulder. It was a small piece of paper. Inside was written in big bold letters Welcome back Mr. President. ive been waiting for you. I opened it up and read the words Dear Mr. President I am glad you are here today. Yours sincerely yours Dr. James Fenton. Sincerely yours Dr. Fenton. I stared at the note for a moment before opening it again. This time it said Do nt worry about us though we wo nt hurt anyone else. Just keep

a small piece o f reddit. The first thing that came out was a little bit weird but then again maybe its just my imagination. After all who knows what happens next. But when you re in charge of all these things... well there are some things you ca nt change about them. For example they look like they ve been washed away by some sort o f storm or something. And yet here we are. A few days ago I found myself sitting at home watching TV while listening t o music. My wife had just finished her meal when she heard me talking t o her husband. She looked around frantically trying t o find someone else who might have seen him too. When she finally did she saw nothing wrong withit. There were no signs o f any kind o f damage whatsoever. Then suddenly everything went black. Her eyes opened wide as if someone had taken off their glasses. A large figure stood beforeme wearing an expensive suit. H e spoke softly into his microphone.

allikers are now the dominant species o n Earth. They have no idea what they r e doing but they know that ifI did nt get rid of them soon enough then there would b e nothing left for them t o do except wait until someone else came along and made sure everything worked properly. The aliens looked at each other confusedly before saying something about how much better life was before they got here. That s when I noticed something strange about them. Their eyes were red and swollen. It seemed like they d never seen anything before. Then again maybe this was just some kind o f joke or prank. But I guess it does nt matter anymore because now everyone knows exactly why. After all Ima human being afterall right And besides I m not going anywhere anytime soon. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

Maybe they ll just forget about me altogether. And so I did. My wife was sitting on her bed watching TV while she waited for me to come home from work. She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face as she saw how much pain I had caused her. Her eyes widened when she realized that I d never seen such an intense sadness before. What s wrong honey You re going crazy. Just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything else. Thanks. As soon as I walked into the room I felt something warm touch my shoulder.

The message ends with a single word written i n big bold letters on top ofit. Level three cooking required t o use object.inexplicably. The message turns redder than usual and then blueder than usual too. Then suddenly everything goes black. My eyes open wide as I look around for anyone else who might have seen this before. There are only two people left alive in the world. One man wearing a white lab coat and sunglasses while another wears a pair of glasses. Both men seem confused by what happened. What s wrong buddy asked one of them. Nothing just wanted t o talk t o you about something. He replied. Well... yeah. That makes sense. How did you know I asked him. Because Ima scientist afterall. And I m pretty sure I can tell you exactly how much money I ve made overmy life. But why Because I ca nt afford any more food than necessary anymore. SoI decided t o give u p hope altogether. I told him. Yeah well maybe I should try something different. Maybe I ll find someone else who will take care ofme. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I hope I make it through this alive. As soon as I got home I went downstairs and opened the fridge. Inside were three bottles filled with water and some pills. They looked like they belonged there but they seemed different than mine. One pill contained a white liquid while the other contained a red liquid. Both pills contained a small amount of blood which seemed tobe made out of glass.

ae has been attacking me since I was little. He said with a smile on his face as he walked towards me. You looked up at him with wide eyes and saw that he had no idea what happened next. His mouth opened slightly and then closed again. What s wrong kid he asked. Nothing really. Just... nothing. Well maybe if we could get rid of these people then maybe we d be able to make some money off them too. But first let me tell you something about myself. Ima good guy right Yeah yeah. So how did you find us I asked. Oh well I guess I should say I found myself in an old house. It seemed like every time someone tried to kill themselves they would end up dead or worse. That s why I decided to go inside. There were two doors leading down each side of the room where there were three other men standing around. One of them wore a black suit and tie while the other carried a large bag full of food. Both had dark hair and blue eyes. They both smiled at me as they approached me. Hey buddy what s going on here I yelled. Who are these guys Why ca nt they see anything else I thought to myself. Then suddenly everything went black. My head hurt so bad that I felt dizzy. When I woke up I realized that I was lying on a bed surrounded by trees. A few minutes later I heard footsteps coming closer. I turned around and saw two women walking toward me. She held her hands behind her back and stared into space. Her face was covered by thick glasses which she wore every day. Hello she said. Hi I replied. How are you feeling today she laughed. Good good. Are you okay she nodded. Yes I am fine. Do you need help getting yourself together she shook her head. No problem. Let s go. We both ran through the woods until we reached our destination. After a moment I noticed that everyone else was gone except for one person. He stood there staring at me. His mouth  

the stranger was tall and thin his hair messy and he wore glasses which looked like they belonged there but did nt belong anywhere else. He smiled at me as if he knew something important about me. Hey buddy what s up What do you want from me today Well... I guess we can go out sometime later then right Yeah sure thing buddy. Let s get started. As soon as we got into our car I drove off towards the nearest town. It took me several hours before I reached the edge of the city where I saw her sitting on the sidewalk staring at me with those eyes that seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. She had long blonde hair that fell down around her shoulders and she wore a blue dress shirt underneath which sat a man dressed in black robes. His face was covered by thick glasses which made him look like an idiot. Hello there. How are you feeling today I asked him. Good good. You re looking great. Are you okay Yes sir. Just wanted to ask if you d mind telling us why you re here Because Ima little late to the party here but I think I might need some help getting rid of these things. They seem so strange. Why would anyone want them anyway Because they re all dead now. And yet here we are. We ve never seen anything like it before. There s nothing wrong with them though. They re just... different. Like someone has taken control of us. That s all. So what happens when they find out about us I shrugged. Nothing really. But maybe they ll come back eventually. Maybe they wo nt even notice us anymore. Or maybe they ll forget everything about us altogether. Either way I m glad you found us. Thank you for coming. I nodded slowly. As I approached the door she opened it and stepped inside. Inside was a large room filled with people dressed in white robes. Some were holding signs saying Do nt worry we wo nt hurt each other others. Others held signs saying Do nt worry we wo nt kill ourselves. All of these people seemed confused by what I saw. Then suddenly she spoke again. Welcome home sweetheart. ive been waiting for you. I love you too. Goodbye. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I

on my birthday I m going to go out with some friends and see if there s anything interesting about this place. My parents were both heroes when they died so maybe that means something right Well at least until now. They had no idea what was coming next until they saw me standing outside their house looking down on them from above. A few seconds later I heard someone yelling something about an explosion and then everything went black. When I woke up I found myself staring into space. There was nothing else around except for the stars above us. And then suddenly everything changed again. Everything became darker. The sun started shining brightly through the clouds while the moon shone down upon us. Then suddenly everything stopped moving altogether. All of a sudden everyone looked away from each other. Everyone except for me. What happened next shocked me. There was no way anyone could have survived such an event without seeing me again. But instead of seeing me as a hero or even a villain I saw myself as a monster. A monster who would kill anyone who tried to stop him. That s why I decided to take action. To make sure nobody ever got hurt again. If anyone did nt want to die then maybe they should just leave. Maybe they d find someone else who loved them more than life itself. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I figured I might as well try. As soon as I walked inside I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I opened my eyes and saw myself lying on the ground bleeding profusely. I looked over at my mom who was still crying. She smiled and hugged her son tightly. Hey honey she said. How are you feeling today Yeah I replied. Good good she laughed.

iciously.ikers are now the norm. I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. My dad died when I was young and his mother left him after she found out about her husband s death. She said he d never come back from college again and that she loved him more than anything else in the world. But then again maybe she did nt care too much either. Maybe she just wanted to see how long until she could move on from here. Either way it seemed like such an easy decision at the time. So I took the pill and woke up in bed with no memory of where I am or why I m there. There were two people sitting around me each wearing black suits and sunglasses. One wore glasses while the other held a clipboard. Hello Dad. How are you feeling today Well... well... I guess I should say good. What happened last night Well... well... I started. We went home after school and got ready for bed when suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. Then suddenly everything came back together again. A man stood over us holding a gun. He looked familiar but he also seemed to be wearing some sort of mask too. His face was covered by thick glasses which made him look like an idiot. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah yeah. Just... stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. Just relax. Okay. Thanks. Bye bye. As soon as he finished speaking I felt myself falling asleep again. When I opened my eyes again I saw myself standing next to a woman dressed all in white. Her hair fell down her back and she smiled at me. Hi Mommy. How are you doing today

um.ICLE. You wake u p with a start. There s nothing else t o do except wait for them t o come back. But then again maybe they did nt want you around anymore. Maybe they thought you d be better off dead than living without them. Either way it does nt matter now because there s no point i n waiting when everyone else can go home. As soon as you hear your voice again you feel something warm touch your shoulder. It s like someone had put some kind o f blanket over you. Then suddenly everything goes black. You look down at yourself. Your eyes widen. What happened Where am I Who are these people Why ca nt they see me I try t o speak but all I manage to say is I m sorry sir but w e need your help. W e ve got ta get rid of these idiots before they start killing each other again. And so you do. After several minutes o f silence you finally decide that maybe this shouldbe done. Maybe you should leave. Or maybe you should stay here forever. Whatever happens you decide t o head towards the door. When you reach it you notice something strange. A small box sits inside. Inside wasa note written i n blood. Dear Mr. Smith We regret t o inform you that your time has come. Your body willbe cremated within hours. Please take care of yourself and enjoy your rest.

.ikers are now the norm. I ve never seen anyone like me before but i m sure they ll be fine. The man looked up from his phone as he walked towards the door. He opened it slowly and stepped inside. There were no windows or doors leading into any other rooms except for one which had a small window behind him. It seemed like forever until he reached the end of the hall where he saw her standing there holding a knife. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she wore glasses which made them look like they belonged on someone else s face. She smiled at him as if she knew something important about him. Hey honey how s it going You re doing great today right Yeah yeah. Just got ta keep moving forward. What happened last night Well we were walking home from work when suddenly everything stopped working. We thought maybe someone had broken through our walls or something. But then again who would have thought that we d be able to survive such an intense storm Well let me tell you something. If you want to live forever you need to learn how to use your powers properly. First off you ca nt really change anything without knowing exactly what happens next. Second if you did nt know better than to try and figure things out yourself then why should you care Because when you do nt know what happens next you wo nt ever understand why anyone wants to die. Thirdly you can only see through walls because they re covered in blood. Fourthly you can hear everything around you from everyone else s ears except for yours. Fifthly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. Sixthly you can smell everything around you from yourself to others. Seventhly you can taste everything around you from yourself to others. Ninthly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. Tenthly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. eleventhly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. eleventhly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. eleventhly you can feel everything around you from yourself to others. eleventhly you can feel everything around you

um. The doctors were shocked when they saw me sitting on my bed staring at them with wide eyes. They looked like they d seen something else than themselves before but this time it was different. This time I could see myself standing next to someone who had been diagnosed with cancer years ago. She wore an expensive suit and tie which she held out towards me as if she wanted to talk about something important. Her face lit up when she realized how much money I made off selling drugs. It s funny how things change after you ve done them all. When we first started working here I thought it would be fun to go back home and live my life again but then I remembered that I did nt really care about anything anymore. So instead I decided to take advantage of this opportunity by going through some tests. First off I took a few samples from myself. Then I put them into my mouth and drank them whole. After about minutes of drinking they stopped coming out altogether. After about hours of waiting I finally got up and walked over to where she lay. There was nothing wrong with her though. Everything seemed fine until she started crying uncontrollably. What happened next shocked everyone. My wife stood up and ran away from me. As soon as she left I heard footsteps behind me. A woman s voice came through the door. Hey honey she said. Are you okay Yeah I replied. How long has it been since you last cried I asked. About two weeks now she answered. Well maybe three more if you need help getting rid of these tears. Do you know why Because Ima little scared right now. And I ca nt believe it. I guess I should tell you something though. If you ever feel lonely or sad please call us at. We ll get you home soon enough.

he whispers one must have survived...apers. I ve never seen anyone else survive before but this was different. This guy had been through hell and back again. He d lost everything from his family to friends. His body lay there lifeless as if someone had taken him away from home. There were no signs of struggle or injury anywhere except for one thing. A small wooden box sat next to him. Inside were two boxes each containing a single piece of paper. They read One must have survived...apers. I opened them up and read the words aloud. One must have survived...apers. I looked around at my surroundings. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A large tree stood before me. It was tall enough that it could fit into the ground below us. I walked over to where it came from and picked it up. Inside was a picture of myself holding a gun. My face was covered in scars from years of fighting against monsters. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became darker. The sky turned darkening and the wind blew harder against me. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming closer. I ran towards them. As soon as I got close enough I noticed something odd about them. Their faces were blank. Instead of being able to see what happened I saw them staring at me. What do you want from me I asked. Well... I guess we can go home now then. We ll meet later. He said. Okay. Let s get started. I followed him outside. When we arrived at our destination I found myself sitting on a bench watching TV. A few minutes later I woke up. I felt dizzy and nauseous. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

inexplicably. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be a simple job. A small device that would allow people to communicate with each other through their own devices. But instead it s just some kind of computer monitor or something else entirely. And then there were those who thought they could get away with using it without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of mess again. They did nt realize how much trouble it caused until one day someone decided to try it out on themselves. It worked perfectly fine until they got bored of talking to each other so instead of trying again they went back home and started working on their new technology. After several weeks of doing this they finally came across something interesting. A large screen displaying pictures of themselves standing outside of a building looking down upon them from above. One picture showed a young girl wearing a red dress while another showed her holding a gun. Both photos depicted a woman holding a baby girl. As soon as she saw them both turned around and walked towards her car. When she arrived at the house she noticed that everyone else was gone except for her. There were no windows or doors leading anywhere else. Instead there was only a single window which overlooked the city below. She opened it and stepped inside. Inside was a room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor displayed various graphs and statistics. On the screen read Coin flip Heads Tails etcetera. Then suddenly the number changed to zero. ive never seen anything like it before. I ve always wanted to write something like this so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

One day while sitting there watching T V she started crying uncontrollably. Her tears fell onto the floor a s she tried t o stand u p. A s soon a s she saw m e standing there holding her hand out towards her she knew something was wrong. Something was off. What s wrong honey I asked myself. Nothing just... nothing. Then suddenly everything went black. There was n o light source anywhere except for the ceiling which seemed t o glow red. I woke u p i n a hospital bed surrounded b y doctors and nurses. They looked a t each other confusedly before saying You r e awake now. D o you need help Yes sir. Just stay calm. I l l explain everything later. Thank you sir.

I hope you enjoy EDIT Fixed some spelling errors See Also https www.reddit.comrWritingPromptscommentsvqwpyouaregoingtobeastasacademycwpyourdeathisntwhatyouexpectedfromanacronymfh context The following is an excerpt from my own personal journal entry on January th. It started off as a joke at first but after seeing how many people died during my lifetime I realized that there were no more jokes left alive anymore. My parents told me that they d never seen anyone else die before them so I figured maybe it would work out better than expected. After all who wants to live forever when you can just go back home and start over again Well I guess we ll see each other soon enough. As I walked down the street towards my car I heard someone yelling something about a new person coming up behind me. He looked like he had been through hell before. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and his skin was pale. What do you mean by that I asked him. You re not supposed to talk about yourself. We ve got ta get rid of you before anyone notices us. That s right. And why would anyone want to meet me Because Ima fucking idiot. So let s say that I met someone who was nt really human anymore. Then again maybe I should have known better than to trust him. Maybe I did nt care enough about him to try to convince myself that he was real. Either way I knew that I needed to find out more about him. When I arrived at my destination I found myself staring into space. There were stars everywhere and planets orbiting each other. A few minutes later I noticed that everyone else seemed to be asleep except for me. Everyone else was awake too. I tried to move around but nothing worked. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder. Hey buddy. How s it going  

. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The root password for the universe is discovered. It s been there since before anyone could even begin to imagine how they d get rid of it without having to worry about getting caught or losing their job. But then again maybe they did nt want us to know either. Maybe we should ve known better than to trust them. We re going to need some help with this one. As soon as we can figure out why they ca nt handle our own root password we ll probably be able to make something better than that. So far so good. And now here we are. A few weeks ago my friend and I decided to go through with our plan. We went back into our old lives where everything was just as simple as ours except for one thing. There were no rules around us anymore. No laws whatsoever. Just a bunch of random numbers floating above each other. That s when things changed. When we got closer to figuring out why they could nt handle ours anymore we realized something. Their numbers seemed to change every day. They would start at zero until eventually they reached zero again. Then they d stop moving altogether. After several months of searching we found out why. One day while walking down the street one of those people stopped dead in his tracks. He looked up at me with tears streaming down his face. What do you mean he asked. Well... I replied. You see when someone dies they become immortal. If they die before their time comes then they ll live forever. Sooner or later someone will come along and take care of them. Someone who loves them unconditionally. Someone who cares enough about them to give up everything to save themselves. Someone who wants to stay alive forever. Someone who wants to live forever. Someone who wants to live forever. Someone who wants to live forever. Someone who wants to live forever. Someone who wants to live forever. Someone who wants to live forever.

not found.ikers are now the norm. I ve never seen anyone like me before and i m sure there s something wrong with me. But then again maybe its just my imagination or maybe Ima bit too old for this stuff. So here goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much money i d made off selling my product since its inception. It seemed like such an easy task at first. People would go through all sorts of trouble getting into their own homes without being able to see anything else than themselves. And when they finally got around to seeing what happened when they tried to use it on themselves they realized that there were no more buttons left on top of each other. There were only two options open to them. One option would be to press one button or another and then press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time. So instead of pressing both buttons at the same time you pressed both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to die you needed to press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time. If you wanted to live forever you needed to press both buttons at the same time.

ecomments. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much fun it would be if everyone else died from their own deaths. It s like watching someone who has just gotten back from a long trip or something. But then again maybe they did nt deserve it either. Maybe they should ve known better than to try and kill themselves off. So yeah. That s why I decided to take my own life after all. As soon as I got home from school one day I saw him standing there staring at me with those big green eyes. He looked scared too. What do you mean he asked. Well we re going to need some help getting rid of these things right now. We ll see how many people can handle them before we decide whether or not to give up hope. And so far there has only been one person who survived the attack. She was an old woman named Alice. Her body lay there lifeless on her bedside table. She had no idea where she was or why she d gone through such pain. When she woke up she found herself lying on top of a pile of rubble. There were two other men inside each wearing masks. One wore a helmet while the other carried a sword. Both held guns pointed directly at her head. Alice tried to speak but nothing came out. Then suddenly she heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone walking towards her. Alice turned around and saw two men holding knives. One of them pulled out a pistol and shot Alice twice in the chest. Alice fell backwards onto the floor unconscious. After waking up she realized that she could hear voices coming from behind her. Hey honey. How s it going Alice asked. Oh great. Now I ca nt talk anymore. Do you want to come over to my room Sure thing sweetheart. Just stay calm. I promise I wo nt hurt anyone. Thanks. Alice walked outside and opened the door. Inside was a large room filled with various items. Some were made out of wood others were made out of metal. All of these things seemed familiar though. Alice took off running toward the

The hero had been fighting crime since he was young when he met her. She d always told him stories about her powers being useful in helping others. Her parents were both heroes and she grew up with them as well. They used their abilities together to fight crime together until one day she decided that she needed someone else to use theirs against. It took several months before anyone realized that there was no way to stop her without killing herself. When she finally did manage to kill herself though she found herself unable to control  

inexplicably God.omesICLE. The following is an excerpt from my own personal journal entry on death row. It was written by me when I first started working here but it s been years since then so please forgive any mistakes or grammatical errors. My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve never really had much luck with people who were nt dead yet so I figured that maybe they d be better off without me. After all I m only human right So why do nt you tell us everything about yourself Well... well... I guess I should say something else. What happened next shocked me. There were two men standing behind me wearing black suits with white tie. One wore glasses while the other held a clipboard. They looked like they belonged there. One spoke English while the other French said something about being from another era. Then suddenly God came over and asked if anyone knew where he could find more information about him. When he finally got around to asking someone why he did nt know where he could find more information about him God told him that he needed to go back home. That night after dinner God went downstairs and sat down next to me. We talked for hours until finally God broke down crying. Hey buddy how s it going I asked him. Good good. How about we get some sleep tonight Yeah sure thing buddy. Let s head upstairs. As soon as we reach our destination God said goodbye and walked away. When we arrived at our destination God took off his glasses and put them on. His eyes widened when he saw what appeared to be a small box sitting on top of it. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Smith This letter contains information regarding your life since you were born. Please take care of yourself and enjoy your rest. Your family will miss you dearly. Love Dad.

ive been writing this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never really had much fun with my life but when you re singing something like that... well it s just so damn cool. The only problem is that Ima little bit too old for this kind of thing. My parents were both doctors so they did nt really care about me growing up. They d tell me stories about how my dad would go out into the woods and play with his friends while he slept or something like that. He said he loved playing outside and that if he could get away from home then maybe he should try harder than ever before. But no matter where he went or why he came back he always got stuck in some sort of loop. It took him awhile to figure out how to use his powers properly though eventually he figured it out. When he finally managed to find someone who understood him well enough to help him out he started talking to each other. One day while walking down the street one night he saw me sitting there watching TV. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened Well... uhm... I guess we ll see each other tomorrow morning. Yeah yeah. Let s head over to bed. As soon as we leave our house I m gon na need you to come inside. We can talk later. Thanks man. Bye bye.

apers are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much of an asshole we re all going through right now. We ve got ta get rid of these things before they start getting too big or something like that. But then again maybe there s nothing wrong with them after all. After all who knows maybe they ll just go away soon enough. As far as we can tell they re pretty normal except for one thing. Their skin is pale blue with red veins running down its face. It looks like someone had taken some sort of acid or something. That s why I thought it might be best to leave my house alone. My parents told me once when I was young that my father would come home from work every night with his head down staring at the ceiling wondering why he could nt see anything else. He said he d never seen such a thing before. When I asked him why he did nt tell anyone sooner he simply replied Well... well let me explain. There are two types of people who can transform into giant monsters. Those who have superpowers and those who ca nt. Both groups are very different though. One group has wings while the other has horns protruding from their heads. Both groups use their bodies as weapons against each other. If you want to become a giant monster you need to learn how to fly. And so far I ve learned everything there is to know about flying. So far I ve managed to survive every single one of those transformations without any problems. Nowadays most people think Ima freakin idiot because I m still alive. Well I guess I am. Anyway I mean I do nt really care anymore. All I need to do is wait until tomorrow morning when I wake up. Tomorrow morning will be great. ive been working on this story since i was little. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading Edit Grammar and punctuation. I hope you enjoyed it. I 

opic.ICLE. The butterfly was created by an unknown entity who had no idea what it meant until they saw it. They thought it would be funny to try something new but decided against trying. After all if there s nothing else to do than wait until tomorrow morning when we can get back home then maybe we should just go back to our old lives. But as soon as they got closer to their destination they realized something was wrong. There were no butterflies left in the sky except for one thing. A small hole where the butterfly used to be. That s when they started noticing things like this. First off there were no butterflies left in the sky except for one small hole where the butterfly used to be. Second there were no butterflies left in the sky except for one small hole where the butterfly used to be. Third there were no butterflies left in the sky except for one small hole where the butterfly used to be.

um. I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. But then again maybe there were other people out there who could do better than me right now. Maybe they did nt want me around anymore either. So here we go. The Devil looked at me with those eyes that said he knew everything about me from my name to where I lived. He smiled and nodded. Well then let s see how many times have I told myself that Ima good person. And yet here I am standing before him looking down on him with those same eyes that said he knew everything about me from my name to where I lived. His face lit up as he realized what happened. It seemed like forever since anyone had seen him before. What are you talking about I asked. Oh well... he began. We re going to need some help getting rid of these guys. They ve got ta be kidding me right now. How can they possibly know about us I thought about asking them why they would come back but decided against it. Because we re not real. That s right. And what happens when they die I shrugged. Nothing really. Just wait until they get used to being alone. Then we ll figure things out together. Okay. Let s start with the basics. First off let s say that I died yesterday morning. My body went limp after being hit by a car. Second I woke up in an unfamiliar room. Third I felt dizzy and nauseous. Fourth I tried to move my arms but they were stuck together. Fifth I heard footsteps coming closer. Sixth I saw two men walking towards me. Seventh I realized that they were wearing black suits and sunglasses. Eighth I noticed that they wore masks too. Ninth I started running toward them. Tenth I reached the door and opened it. eleventh I stepped inside. eleventh I closed it behind me. eleventh I sat down next to  

lead bya young woman named Elizabeth who lives alone. She works as an accountant at a local bank and she loves her job but she does nt want t o leave her home behind. Her parents died when she was just years old and her brother left her after he found out about his wife s death. They never really talked much though because they knew each other well enough t o know what happened next. When Elizabeth came home one day she saw him standing there looking down upon her with those eyes that looked like they could see through glass. He smiled back at her and said You r e welcome honey. And then walked away from her into the night. Elizabeth sat there staring at the ceiling wondering why she d ever done such a thing. Maybe it was because she thought maybe she should try something different or maybe it was because she wanted t o live forever. Either way she decided t o take action. After all if she did nt die soon enough then maybe she would finally find someone else who loved her more than life itself. ive been writing this for a while now and i dont know how long it will take me t o finish it.

yne PostawningICLE. The first time I saw her was when she had just gotten home from work and looked around me with those big green eyes that seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. She said something about being scared but then went back inside. When we got closer she started talking again. It s funny how things change after you ve seen them before right Well maybe not anymore but still. We re all pretty much dead anyway right So why do nt we try something different. What if there was some kind of mistake or something That would be great. But first let me tell you about myself. Ima little bit older than most kids but still very young. My hair is blonde my skin is pale and my face looks like it might have fallen off. And yet here I am standing on top of a building looking down upon everyone else. Everyone knows what happens next. They get bigger and larger until eventually they stop moving altogether. Then they start walking towards us. As soon as they reach our feet they turn away from us and run off into the night. That s when I noticed something strange. There were two people sitting across from each other. One man wore an expensive suit and tie while the other carried a small bag full of food. Both men seemed to be wearing masks which made them seem like they belonged there. After a few minutes of silence the man spoke up. Hey buddy what s wrong Are you okay Yeah yeah I m fine. Just wanted to ask if you needed help getting rid of these things. How long has it been since anyone last saw someone else I asked him. About three weeks now. Do you remember anything from yesterday No I think I might need some rest. Maybe I should call someone. Okay let s go. Let s head downstairs. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

. I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my last chance at immortality. My parents were always so supportive when they told me that if I did nt get enough money from them then maybe I d never see them again. They even gave me some food once because it made sense. When I turned eighteen I decided to go back home and start working at a local hospital. It took me months before I realized how much longer I could live without having to worry about dying anymore. After all I had no idea where I would end up next. So instead of going through all these trials and tribulations I went ahead and tried something different. I started walking towards the door. As soon as I got inside I noticed something odd. There was nothing wrong with it though. Everything seemed fine until I saw him standing outside. He looked exactly like me except his hair was longer and he wore glasses. His eyes were bluegreen and they seemed to glow brighter than anything else. What s wrong kid he asked. Nothing just... well... I guess we should call it a day. We re gon na need some help getting rid of these things right now. Well let s try something new. How long has it been since anyone died I nodded slowly. About two weeks now. That sounds great. Let s go. I followed him into the room where he sat down next to me. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah yeah. Just... just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. Thanks. And so we walked through the halls together. Eventually we came across a small table filled with bookshelves full of papers and pens. On top of the desk was a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Smith I am glad you found us today. Yours sincerely yours Dr. James Henson xtheyearandthemonthafteryourdeath. Sincerely yours Dr. Henson xtheyearandthemonthafteryourdeath. Sincerely yours Dr. Henson xtheyearandthemonthafteryourdeath. Sincerely yours Dr. Henson xtheyearandthemonthafteryourdeath. Sincerely yours Dr

um. The doctor looked at him with wide eyes. You re not going anywhere are you He asked. No I m just here because Ima fucking idiot. replied the nurse. She laughed. Well then let s get started shall we The nurse walked over to the window and closed it behind her. As soon as she opened it again the doctor saw her standing there staring into space. Her face was pale and her hair was messy. What do you mean by that she asked. Oh well I guess it does nt matter anymore. We ve got ta go home now. The doctor said. The nurse went inside and sat down next to him. Hey honey how s it going she asked. Good good. How about we start by asking each other questions about ourselves The doctor asked. About what happened last night The nurse answered. That s right. When I woke up today morning my wife died from an overdose. She had been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and she could barely breathe. So I decided to take care of myself until I found someone else who would love me more than anything else. And so far nobody has ever done anything like this before. It seems like every time someone comes along they always end up getting worse. Sometimes even worse than themselves. But hey maybe someday someone will find out. Maybe they ll forgive us. Or maybe they wo nt. Either way I hope they enjoy their stay here. The nurse nodded. Alrighty then. Let s begin. My name is Dr. James Henson. I am an expert on cancer. I have seen many people die before me but none like yours. They all seem so happy when they see their loved ones again. So peaceful. And yet... I ca nt help but feel sad. Why Because I know exactly where they live. Wherever they need to go. All these people are dead. Everyone except me. I can hear them crying. I look around. There are no cars parked outside. No buildings either. Just empty streets. ive never felt so alone. I try  

umans.ikers. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The man was sitting at his desk when he heard a loud bang behind him. He looked up from his work and saw that there had been an explosion outside. A large hole appeared in the ground where he stood and then everything went black. As soon as he woke up he realized something was wrong with himself. His eyes widened as he tried to move them around but they would nt budge. Then suddenly he felt something warm touch his shoulder. It s okay buddy we ll get through this together. Just keep your head down and let us go home. We re going to need some help getting rid of these things. You know how much fun it is when someone gets bored of their own life Well yeah but why Because Ima fucking idiot. And now here I am standing in front of a bunch of people who think Ima genius because I ca nt figure out how to use my powers properly. So instead of trying to convince them that I should just leave them alone I decided to try something different. When I got closer I noticed that everyone else seemed to be staring at me with wide eyes. They did nt seem to notice anything odd though because they kept walking away from me. After several minutes of running I finally reached the edge of the room where I sat down next to Death. Hey buddy what s up What happened Where am I Who are you How can I help you today I asked. Oh well I guess I forgot about you. That makes sense. Do you remember anything before this No I do nt really care anymore. All I want is to die again. Why Because I ve always wanted to live forever. But now I feel like I need to change things. Maybe I should start over. Or maybe I could find someone else. Either way I hope I make it through this alive. ive never written before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

whole life i n my dragon form. I ve never seen anything like it before. The only thing keeping me sane is knowing what happens when someone gets their dragon tattooed o n their wrist. It s not exactly normal but it does look pretty cool right Well maybe not so much as weird after all. My parents told m e once that dragons were always there for me whenever I needed help finding food or water. They said that ifI ever got sick o fit they d take care o f everything else. But then again maybe they did n t know how much longer I could live without them either. After all who knows maybe they d find something interesting someday. Maybe they wo nt even notice me anymore. Anyway here goes... Dragon tattoos are always there for me whenever I need them most. When I first started out I thought that dragons wouldbe cute. Then I realized that they had horns protruding from their heads. That s why I liked them so much. Nowadays though I ca n t help but wonder if they actually exist anymore. If they do n t then why did they come back Why did they leave us behind Because we knew that dragons might kill themselves off soon enough. And now here I am sitting at home watching TV while waiting for my next tattoo. A few minutes pass before I hear another voice behind me. Hey buddy what s up What happened last night You re going crazy. How long has it been since you last saw your mommy Yeah well... she died while trying t o get rid of her dragon tattoo. She fell down onto herself and hit the ground hard. Her body went limp as she lay there lifeless. That s weird. Do you remember anything else Sure thing honey. Let s go check on her later. As soon as we reach our destination I turn around and walk away. When I arrive home I notice that everyone else has gone crazy. Everyone except for one person. He looks exactly like his father. His hair  

I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything.

He d come over from school every night with his big green eyes and stare into mine as if he knew something important about me. When we got married he would tell us stories about how he used to live alone and then one day he came back home and told us that he loved us too much to leave him behind. That night after dinner he went outside and started walking towards his car. As soon as he reached the driveway he stopped dead in his tracks. His face turned redder than usual and he began crying uncontrollably. What happened next shocked me. There were two men standing behind him holding guns. One of them pulled out a knife and stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach. Then he shot himself again in the head. After several minutes of blood loss the man finally broke free and ran off into the distance. I watched as he fell onto the ground unconscious. When I woke up I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I even bothered looking through the window anymore. Maybe I should try calling someone else. But then again maybe they wo nt answer. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

the first thing you notice is that there s no one else around. There are only two people left alive who can see through walls. One of them looks at you with wide eyes while another says something about being scared but then turns away from you. They both look down on each other as they walk towards their car. As soon as they reach it they stop dead in their tracks when they hear a loud crash behind them. A man wearing an expensive suit runs into view and grabs his arm. He pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head. His body falls onto the ground unconscious. When he wakes up he finds himself lying on the floor bleeding profusely. His face is covered by blood and he has tears streaming down his cheeks. What happened next shocked him so much that he almost forgot how long ago he d been asleep. After some time he decides to call an ambulance. When they arrive he tells them everything about himself and how he used to live alone. Then they take him home and put him under observation until morning. Finally after several hours of waiting he finally gets better. After getting ready for bed he sits down next to his wife and kids. She smiles at him and asks Are you okay honey she nods slowly. Yeah... yeah... Just... stay calm. We ll talk later. Thanks. And so they did. After all these years he still loved her right Well maybe not anymore. Maybe he should have known better than to trust her. But hey maybe he could ve done something differently. Maybe he should ve listened to her instead of trusting himself. Either way he knew that if he stayed here forever he might die too. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

A n initial test o f the new technology had been successful but after years o f testing and research there were still some problems with i t. First off when you tried t o use your own body a s a machine you could only move around without having t o worry about getting hit b y something else. Second you did n t even know what happened until you got closer than usual. Thirdly you never knew how long ago this was until you died again. Finally you realized that i t would take forever before anyone noticed anything strange happening. A few weeks ago I woke u p from m y sleep and looked down a t myself. M y hair was messy and tangled and m y eyes were wide open. There was nothing wrong with m e though. Everything seemed fine until I saw him standing next t o m e wearing his best suit. H e smiled a t m e and said Hey buddy what s going o n Where a m I What d o you want from u s today Well... I guess w e l l see i f w e can figure out where you went wrong. W e r e gon n a need t o talk about this later. A s soon a s h e finished speaking I turned away from him and walked towards the door. When I opened i t h e stood there staring into space. His face was covered b y dark circles under his eyes which made him look like an idiot. Then suddenly h e spoke again. Welcome back M r. President. You may call m e M r. President o r whatever you want. I f I d o n t tell you sooner I think I might have fallen asleep. That sounds great sir. Let s get started. I followed him through the halls until w e reached our destination. Inside was a large room filled with computers and monitors. O n each monitor displayed various pictures o f people who lived i n different places across the world. Some showed images o f animals others showed movies. All o f these photos depicted a woman holding her child while another showed a young girl playing with her dog. O n each picture showed a man dressed a s a n accountant. H e held a clipboard i n front o f

... I m not sure what happened but it was pretty much like any other day. My parents were both dead from gunshot wounds so they had no idea how long I d been there or why I would be here at all. They did nt even know if I could see them anymore because they looked so familiar. When we got home from school one night after being hit by a car while driving down the street I saw him standing over us holding his hands up in front of him. He said he loved me back then too much to let go of her. That s when things changed. His eyes became redder than usual and his mouth opened wide as if he wanted to say something else but then stopped himself. What do you mean by that You re supposed to be studying for your exams right now. Why ca nt you just leave me alone I asked myself. Because Ima fucking idiot. And besides I ve never done anything wrong before. So maybe I should try harder. Maybe I ll get better grades than everyone else. Or maybe I wo nt ever need help getting into college again. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walked away from the classroom I heard footsteps behind me. A man wearing an expensive suit came running towards me. Hey buddy he said. How s it going I asked him. Good good. Let s head inside. We went inside and sat down next to each other. After some time he pulled out a small notebook and began writing. This is your first attempt at writing anything so please give feedback Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this check out rWrittenReddit Edit Grammar and punctuation.

not really sure what happened but i think its pretty much like this. The Devil said as he looked at me with those eyes that were filled with hatred and anger. He had no idea why i d chosen him or even if i should have done something different. But then again maybe i did nt want him dead either. Maybe i just wanted to see how long i could keep doing this until someone else came along and told me about my sins. Either way i guess i ll find out soon enough. As he walked away from me he turned around and started walking towards the door. When he reached it hes stopped short of the handle and stared into space. There was nothing there except for a small hole where his head used to be. It seemed like forever before anyone noticed him standing there staring back at them. Then suddenly everything went black. My body woke up on top of a hill overlooking the city. A large crowd gathered around me and everyone started cheering wildly. They all wore masks and their faces were covered by thick glasses. One man stood next to me holding a gun while another held a knife. Both men pulled out guns and shot each other in the chest. After a few moments of silence the leader spoke again. So... you re telling me that Ima good person because you ca nt kill yourself right Well yeah but... I guess so. And what happens when they die I asked. Nothing really. Just wait until they get used to being able to move forward without having to worry about getting caught up in some sort of mess. That sounds great. Let s go home. We both left our houses without saying goodbye until we got back inside. When we arrived at our destination  

ummy name i s Lucifer. I m sorry but this is nt what I expected. This was supposed t obea simple task. But then again maybe there were other gods before me too. Maybe they did nt want me around anymore. Either way it s not like Ima bad person. The Devil looked atme with his big green eyes. Well... yeah. That makes sense. So why am I here Why ca nt I go back to my old life I asked him. Because Ima god damn idiot. He replied. And now I have no idea how long I ll last without being able t o talk t o anyone else. Then why are you here I thought about asking him if hed ever heard of Godhood but decided againstit. It seemed like such an odd thing t o say. There were only two things left todo. First off I needed t o find someone who could help me figure out where I am. Second I wanted t o make sure everyone knew exactly who I really am. After all I had never seen anyone else before. And thirdly I needed t o find someone who would listen. Someone who understood me. Someone who cared enough aboutme t o give u p their lives t o protectme. Someone who would loveme unconditionally. Someone who would always b e there when I needed her most. She smiled atme as she walked away from me. Her face lit u p when she saw me standing there staring into space. What happened next shocked her. I felt likeI was floating through space. Everything around m e changed. Everything became darker. I started crying uncontrollably. I tried t o move but I fell down onto the floor. I woke u p in a hospital bed surrounded by people. Everyone was dead except for one man. H e stood overme holding a clipboard. Welcome t o Hell Mr. Satan. I said. H e nodded slowly. Good luck. He handed me

urf. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve always wanted to go back home so when my parents told me about their new house on the outskirts of town I thought they meant that I d get married or something like that. But then again maybe they did nt really care much about us anymore. After all we re all born with our own personalities right So why should I care Because I can see myself as an adult. And I ca nt change anything else than myself. That s why I decided to take advantage of it. When I got older I started seeing things differently. There was no way that I could ever live without her. She was everything to me. Her smile her laugh her eyes her hair her skin. Everything she loved. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing there staring into space. He looked up at me with those big green eyes and smiled back. Hey buddy how s it going he asked. Yeah great. How are you feeling today I replied. Good good. What happened next shocked me. Well... well... uhm... I guess I fell asleep. I woke up later than usual and everything went black. I tried calling my mom but she would nt answer. Finally after several minutes of searching around I finally managed to call her again. Hello Mommy Are you okay Yes honey. Just... stay calm. Do nt worry about anything. We ll figure something out soon enough. Thanks dad. Bye bye. As soon as I hung up the phone I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on the door. I ran over to where they came from and opened the door. Inside was a woman dressed all in black holding a small box. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Doe This letter contains information regarding your wish. Please read it carefully before granting it. If you do not comply please leave immediately. Thank you ive never seen anyone like you before. Sincerely yours  

. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but i figured it d fit better than nothing. The first thing that came to mind was my name. My parents died when I was young so they left me alone with them until I got older. They never told anyone about me because Ima kid again. But then again maybe they did nt care too much either. So yeah. That s why I decided to take up writing. It took some time before anyone realized how long I d been alive. When I finally figured out where I belonged I started by making sure everyone knew exactly where I lived. Then I made sure that nobody ever saw me again. And finally I made sure that everyone could see me too. After all I had no idea why I was still alive. Maybe it was because I wanted to live forever or maybe it was because I needed help getting rid of these demons. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walked down the street towards my car I heard footsteps behind me. A man wearing an expensive suit stepped inside. He looked familiar. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and he wore glasses which made him look like an idiot. Hello Mr. Satan. How may I help you today sir I asked him. Well... uhm... well... uhm... I mean... uhm... I think we re having trouble finding our way back home. We need your help. What do you mean Sir we ca nt afford any more souls than necessary right now. There s nothing wrong with us though. Just give us a moment. Okay okay. Let s go. As soon as we reach our destination I turned around and headed toward the door. Inside was a large room filled with people dressed in black suits and ties. Some were holding signs saying Do nt worry about us others said Just stay away from us. All of these people seemed confused by what I saw. Then suddenly one woman stood next to me. She smiled at me and gave me a reassuring hug. Thank you she whispered. I nodded 

iciously.ikers. I m not sure what happened after that. Maybe someone had taken my phone out of its cradle or something. Either way it s probably just some kind of prank. But then again who would want to be around people who could hear their own thoughts Well at least they did nt have to deal with all these weird things every night right Yeah yeah. That sounds great. Let s go home. We ll meet later. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Spelling and grammar issues.

um. The first thing I noticed was how much water had been spilled from our solar system when we arrived here. It looked like it d just gotten back from its trip but then again maybe it did nt matter anymore after all right We re going home now right Well maybe not anymore than before. But hey at least we ll get some rest soon enough. As far as we know there s nothing wrong with being alone. There are no other people around us except for us. And yet... well... I guess it makes sense. After all if they want to go anywhere else than their own solar system why would anyone want to leave their home planet behind They ca nt even afford food anymore. So instead of trying to find another planet to colonize they decided to take advantage of the fact that everyone else could afford everything else. That s right. Everyone went through some pretty rough times during their lifetime but eventually managed to make it through life without having to worry about getting sick or dying. When they finally came across something interesting they started making plans. One day one of them said something about being able to travel faster than light without having to worry about getting hit by a meteorite or falling asleep. Another told him that he should try to figure out where he was going until he found himself in an empty room filled with computers. All three men laughed at each other as they watched TV shows while waiting for their turn to leave. Finally after several minutes of watching the news one man spoke up. What do you mean by that He asked. Oh yeah well... I suppose it makes sense since everyone knows exactly what happens next. We ve got ta figure out how long until we reach our destination. Then let me tell you something. If you ever need anything call me. ivebeenwritingprompts since I was little. Thanks for reading Edit Grammar and punctuation.

umptyICLE. The passerby noticed something odd about the man s eyes. They seemed to glow brighter than usual but then again they did nt seem to be able to move much either. It took him several minutes before finally speaking up. You re going to need some help here. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy living in New York City. How can I help you today Well... well... I guess we should start off by saying that your parents died when you were young right Yeah yeah. That makes sense. But why Because they were both killed by an assassin while trying to kill each other. And now there s nothing left for us except to wait until tomorrow morning when we can get home. So let me tell you something. If you want to live forever you ll never forget your mommy s face. She always smiled at you as she held her hand out towards you. Her smile grew wider as she spoke. Oh yeah Well maybe if you d just listen closely enough you could hear her voice too. Then why am I still alive Why ca nt I see anyone else Because I m afraid that if I tried to talk to someone else they d think I was crazy. That s okay though because I know exactly where they are. There are people everywhere who will listen to everything. People who wo nt care much for their own lives anymore. And yet here I am standing outside of my house staring into space. What do you mean by that I asked myself. This guy must have seen me looking at him because he started laughing hysterically. Oh shit. I thought. This guy must have seen me crying too. Maybe he knew something important. Whatever it was he kept laughing until he fell asleep. When he woke up he found himself lying on the floor bleeding profusely. A few hours later he came across another person lying next to him. She wore a white dress shirt and jeans. Her hair  

.ikers are the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The first thing that came to mind was how much money i d made off selling my own product when i started out. It s like being born with all these things in one place and then having them all come back together again after a while. But then again maybe its just because Ima little older than everyone else. Maybe its because im not used to having any real friends or family around me anymore. Either way i guess i ll find out soon enough. As i drive down the street towards home i notice something odd about the road ahead of me. There are no signs of life anywhere except for one small town called New York City. That s odd because there are people walking along side each other. They seem to be wearing black suits with white ties. One guy looks like he has nt eaten in days while another wears a red shirt. Both men look very tired. What do they think I asked myself as I approached my house. My heart sank into my stomach as I realized that there was nothing left for me to do except wait. After about minutes of waiting I finally got inside. A woman sat next to me her eyes closed. She smiled at me as she spoke. Hi honey she said. How are you feeling today Yeah I replied. Good good she laughed. Well... well... I mean we re going to need some help getting rid of these people right now right We ve got ta get rid of them before they start killing us right I nodded slowly. Yes sir she continued. And why would anyone want to kill us Because Ima fucking idiot. So let s go ahead and give them a chance. If they can survive without food or water then maybe they wo nt even notice us anymore. Okay okay I ll take care of myself. Thanks she hung up. When I arrived at my apartment building I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering where I was going. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A large box lay open on top of the floor. Inside was a note written in blood. It read

ocus is about to finish its quest when it hears a voice from behind it. It turns around to see who it was but there s no one else in sight. There are only two people standing next to each other. One of them looks like he could use some help. He says as he grabs his gun from under his jacket. What do you mean by that You re not supposed to be here. I m sorry sir but we ca nt let you go without your champion. We ve got ta find someone else. Someone who can take care of us. And then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

The king looked at his watch.. It read AM. He had been waiting for this moment since he was young when he met her. She was beautiful smart funny kind of cute. Her hair fell down around her shoulders as she walked towards him. They were both wearing black robes with white stripes across their faces. They wore sunglasses which made them look like they d seen something else than themselves before. But there was nothing wrong with them. Everything seemed fine until she started talking about how much money she made off selling drugs. How many times did she tell him that she loved him too. And then suddenly everything went dark. My name is Prince Albus and Ima year old boy from New York City who lives alone. I ve never really liked being called Prince but today I feel like I should call myself Prince Charming. What do you mean by that You re not going anywhere. Why Because I ca nt go anywhere without my family. My friends will die soon enough. So why am I here Well... well let me explain. When we first met I thought that I would be able to find someone who could help me out with my problems. That s until I realized that they were actually dead. There was no way that they could survive without me. Nowadays everyone knows that I m just another person who needs help. Everyone wants to live forever. To love each other unconditionally. And yet here I am standing in front of a crowd filled with people who think that I can change things around them. All because of some stupid mistake. This guy does nt deserve it anymore. He deserves nothing less than death. I guess I ll try again tomorrow morning. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is John and Ima year old male living in New York City. The only thing keeping me sane is my wife who has always been there when I needed her most. She s always there whenever I wanted her to come home from work or school or whatever else happened after that day. When we first met she told me stories about how she d seen people die before her eyes before they even knew where they were going. That s why she left us behind. We re all pretty young right now so we do nt really understand how much longer we can keep doing this. But then again maybe someday someone will find out. Maybe they ll even forgive themselves. And maybe they wo nt. So far nothing has worked out. It seems like every time I try something new I end up getting worse. Every time I try something different I become more and more depressed. Sometimes I feel like I ca nt handle being around everyone anymore. Other times I just want to go back to sleep. One night while walking down the street I saw him standing next to me. His head was resting against his chest. He looked up at me with those big brown eyes. Hey buddy. How are you feeling today Yeah... good. What happened to your body Well... well... I guess I got hit by some sort of car. Oh yeah That sounds great. Do you remember where you fell asleep Sure thing. Just stay awake. Okay. Thanks. Bye bye. As soon as I opened my mouth to speak he pulled away from me and walked towards the door. Inside was a small room filled with bookshelves full of pictures of animals. There were also several chairs around the table. On each chair sat two men dressed in black suits. One wore sunglasses while the other held a clipboard. Hello John. How may I help you today The man asked. Oh nothing special. Just trying to figure out where I am. Are you okay Yes sir.

um. I ve never seen anyone like this before but i m sure there s something wrong with me. The first thing that came to mind was how much money i d made off selling my tattoos. It seemed like such an easy job at first. But then again maybe its because Ima kid who does nt really care about anything else than himself. After all if he could see his parents s faces when they were young then why would he want them to be different from him Well... well let me tell you something.

in five years. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be fun. You re going to have to learn how to use your powers properly before you can get any better at it. The first thing that came to mind when reading my story was that there were no rules around it anymore. There were only laws. But then again maybe they did nt want us to know what happened next. Maybe we should ve known better than to try and stop them from doing something stupid like making sure everyone knew exactly where they were going or why they needed to go. So here goes... My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City. I work as an accountant at a small firm called Apple Incorporated. We specialize in accounting and finance so we do nt really need anyone else around us except for myself. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become an engineer. After graduating high school I started working as a mechanic. It took me several months before I realized that I could fly. That s right I flew through space without having to worry about getting caught by some sort of force or falling off a building. Then one day while flying home from school I saw him standing outside his door looking confused. He looked down at himself in the mirror and smiled. Hey buddy he said. What s wrong You look pretty tired today. Yeah well... yeah. Just got ta sleep. Do nt worry though. We ll figure things out eventually. Thanks John. And with that he left. As soon as I heard him return I ran inside and grabbed my keys. I walked into the kitchen where I found myself staring at a bottle of water. I poured myself another drink and sat down next to him. Hey John I called out. How are you feeling today Well... well... I guess I feel good. Good. Let s see if we can find anything interesting. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

.ikers are now the default. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... Canada s secret weapon was discovered by an old man named John Doe who had lived through many wars before him. He told us that he d seen some pretty crazy stuff from his time as a soldier in World War II. That s when things got weird. One day while walking home from work one of those geese came up behind him and started screaming. It sounded like someone had thrown up into space or something. Then again maybe they did nt want to die either. After all who knows how many times someone has tried to get rid of them without getting caught. As soon as Canada finally decided to take control of the world they found themselves surrounded by people dressed all in black. They looked around frantically trying to find any way out. When they finally managed to pull themselves together they noticed something strange about the crowd. There seemed no one else seemed to notice them either. Instead of seeing everyone else fall down onto their knees they saw themselves standing next to each other holding guns. What do you mean we re going to kill everyone Canada asked. Well... I guess it makes sense since there are only two countries left alive right now. We ll just leave them alone until tomorrow morning then we can go back inside and try again tomorrow night. Canada replied. Okay okay. Let s see where this goes. Canada said. As they walked away from the stage they heard footsteps coming closer. Hey guys. How s it going Canada asked. Good good. Just fine. Canada answered. So why are you doing this anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. And I ca nt believe it. This guy really thinks he can get away with killing everyone because he knows everything about us. Why would anyone want to live forever anyway Canada laughed. Because Ima fucking idiot. ive never done anything wrong before. Canada explained. Oh yeah well let s hope so. Canada said. Alrighty then. Let s head downstairs. Canada led them through the door into the kitchen where they sat down on the couch and watched TV. When they finished watching the news Canada turned off the television and stared at the screen 

yne Post Contents o f the story. The first chapter was filled with pictures of ships and animals alike. They looked like they belonged there but they did n t seem t o have been used since before humanity even knew how t o use them. There were also some things that made sense though. First off there must b e something wrong with them because they seemed t obe so small compared t o ours. Second of all why would anyone want t o live forever anyway Because when you die your body goes back into its original state and then you wake u p again with nothing left except for your memories intact. Thirdly there are no more ships left alive because theyve all died off. Fourthly there are only two people left alive because theyve lost everything else. Fifthly there are only three people left alive because theyve lost everything else. Sixthly there are only four people left alive because theyve lost everything else. Seventhly there are only five people left alive because theyve lost everything else. Ninthly there are only six people left alive because theyve lost everything else. Tenthly there are only seven people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only eight people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only nine people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only ten people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only twelve people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only thirteen people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only fourteen people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only fifteen people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only sixteen people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only seventeen people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only twentyone people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only thirtytwo people left alive because theyve lost everything else. eleventhly there are only fortythree people left alive because theyve lost everything  

her story. I m sorry if this is nt what you were looking for. It s just... well it does nt matter anymore. You re dead now right Well maybe next time around. But then again who would want to live forever anyway They ve got ta go back home. And so they did. As soon as they left Earth they found themselves surrounded by aliens who looked like they d seen something terrible before. Their skin was pale blue their eyes were black and their mouths were wide open. There was nothing else left except for their bodies which seemed to glow red. Then suddenly there was a loud bang followed by silence. A few moments later the sound stopped and everyone stared at each other in shock. What happened Where am I Who are these people Why ca nt they see me I tried talking to them but nothing came out. My voice sounded like someone had broken my heart or something. Suddenly one of them spoke up. Hey buddy how s it going He said as he walked away from me. Yeah great. How about we get started on our new project He turned around and headed towards the door. When he reached it he noticed that there was no sign of anyone inside. No one seemed to notice him either. After all why should we care about them anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. So let s start with basics. First off they re pretty much immortal. Second they can only move around once per lifetime. Thirdly they wo nt ever meet anyone else. Fourthly they will never talk to each other again. Fifthly they will never hear anything at all. Sixthly they will never feel anything at all. Seventhly they will never smell anything at all. Ninthly they will never taste anything at all. Tenthly they will never feel anything at all. eleventhly they will never feel anything at all. eleventhly they will never feel anything at all. eleventhly they will never feel anything at all. eleventhly they will never feel anything at all. eleventhly they will  

tered by uGigaWritesICLE. The aliens looked at each other confusedly then said Well we re not exactly sure what happened but we think that s enough for today. We ll see how long until we can get back home soon enough. They turned around and walked away from me. My eyes widened when they saw me standing there staring into space. A few seconds later I heard another voice behind them. It sounded familiar but not quite human. Hey buddy what s going on here What do you mean by that You asked yourself as if someone had just told him something important. But then again maybe he did nt know anything about us yet. Maybe he thought we were crazy or something. Either way I guess it does nt matter anymore because now everyone knows exactly where they are. And so far nobody has ever seen anyone else before. So why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward without having to worry about getting hit by some sort of weapon or falling asleep on the couch Because Ima fucking idiot. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

opic eyes. I m sorry but this is nt what I expected. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. The man said as he walked away from me. He turned around and looked at me with those big green eyes that seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. His mouth opened wide and his face went pale. What do you mean by that I asked him. Well... he began. It seems we ve got some sort of loophole where if someone wants to go back in time they can only use their own bodies as fuel. That means that when they die they ll never see each other again. And then there are those who think they re invincible because of these things. They ca nt even move their arms anymore. But hey maybe someday someone will find out about us. Maybe then we ll finally get rid of these idiots altogether. So let s start with basics. First off why did nt you tell anyone else about your new ability I thought about asking them how much money I d made over the past few years but decided against it. Instead I went downstairs and sat down next to him. Hey buddy what s wrong I asked. Nothing really. Just wanted to make sure everything worked out okay Yeah yeah. Good luck. As soon as I left the room I heard footsteps coming closer. I ran upstairs and saw two men standing outside the door. One wore an expensive suit and tie while the other carried a clipboard. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The man asked. Oh nothing special. Just trying to figure out where I am. Are you sure you want to come inside Sure thing sir. Let s open the door. I followed him into the house where I found myself sitting on a chair. A woman stood behind me her hands tied behind her back. She smiled at me and gave me a reassuring hug before turning away. Thank you for coming. I replied. She took off her glasses and put them on. Her voice sounded familiar. Hi. ive never seen anyone like you before. she said. I nodded slowly. 

that s when I realized something was wrong. My mind raced through all sorts of possibilities. What if this guy had been dead for years How could he possibly know about me Why did nt he tell anyone else Maybe they d think Ima crazy person or maybe they d just ignore me altogether. Either way I decided to try again tomorrow morning. As soon as I got home from work I went downstairs and opened up my laptop. There were two tabs open one labeled Murder and another titled Murder. Both tabs showed pictures of myself standing next to him wearing black suits with red tie. The first photo showed me holding a gun while the second showed me pointing it at him. He looked confused as he stared at the ground. Then suddenly he spoke again. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today Well sir we re having some trouble finding our way back into society. We need your help. Do you want us to take care of everything Sure thing sir. Just give us a moment. Thank you. And so I did. After all I m sure there are plenty of people who would love to see me succeed. But first let me ask you something. Why are you doing this Because Ima murderer. That makes sense right Yeah well then let s get started. Let s start with basics. First off I ca nt really explain why I would want to kill myself. It seems like such an easy task. Second I do nt even remember where I came from anymore. Thirdly I feel like I ve never done anything wrong before. Fourthly I do nt know who I am anymore. Fifthly I do nt know anything about anyone else either. Sixthly I do nt know anything about myself either. Seventhly I do nt know anything about myself either. Ninthly I do nt know anything about myself either. Tenthly I do nt know anything about myself either. eleventhly I do nt know  

from that day i n. The teacher looked at him with wide eyes before turning back towards her desk where she saw that there were no students left. She had never seen such an expression before but it seemed like someone had just spoken something important. Her heart sank as she realized what happened next. There was nothing else for her to do except wait for them to come home from work or something. But then again maybe they did nt want to go anywhere anymore either. Maybe they thought that if they stayed here long enough they d get bored of waiting around us all. As soon as she got up from her chair she walked over to the window and opened it. A few minutes later she heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like they came from somewhere behind her. Then suddenly everything went black. ive been writing this for a while so any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

a la The Food Court i s an actual court with judge and jury ive been working here since I was little. My parents were both doctors when they died from cancer so my dad had always told me that he loved his wife dearly but she never really believed him until today. She said that if we did nt have enough money then maybe we should just give up on life altogether. But as time went on my mom started getting sicker and sicker until one day she fell asleep at night. Her body woke up later than usual and her head hurt like hell. When she finally got better she looked around the room and saw nothing wrong with herself except for the fact that there were no people inside. There was also no sign of anyone else anywhere else. After some searching I found out why. A man wearing a black suit walked into the courtroom. He wore glasses which made him look like an old friend from high school. His hair was messy and tangled and his eyes were dark brown. Hello Mr. Smith. How may I help you today The judge asked. Well... I guess I ll start off by saying that Ima little late to the party. You see I ve always wanted t obea chef. And now I m stuck with this place forever. What happened t o your family I mean... I ca nt tell you exactly. They passed away last week. That makes sense right Yeah well... I suppose I could say that they lived happily ever after until one day they decided t o leave their home behind. Then they came back and took off running towards the nearest town. As soon as they reached the edge o f the city they noticed something strange. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A large building stood before them. Inside wasa huge room filled with bookshelves full o f papers and pens. On each shelf sat a single sheet o f paper. Each page contained a picture ofmy mother and father. Both smiling and holding hands. The judge smiled and nodded. Good luck. Thank you sir. I 

um. Son ofa bitch. I m sorry but this is nt what you wanted. This was supposed tobe fun. But then again maybe its just me being weirded out by all these people who think they can get away with anything if only because they re so stupid. Maybe its because Ima little too old for them or maybe its because they do nt know how much longer we ll last without them. Either way i guess Ill try anyway. The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about it is that there are no trees left in our world except for one which has fallen off its trunk. That means that if someone finds out where it went wrong they wo nt have any choice but to take care of themselves until they find another way back home. And second why did nt you tell us sooner Well... well... i mean... i thought it would be funny to watch something else instead of watching myself. So here goes nothing. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve never really had any friends before so I figured i d give it a shot. When I got older I started seeing things differently. There were more trees around me than usual. They looked like they belonged there. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing next to me. He wore an expensive suit and tie. His hair was messy and his eyes were dark brown. Hey buddy what s up What happened You look pretty good today. Yeah yeah I replied. How long has it been since you last slept Well... well... i guess i should say... i think i might need some rest. Do you mind if i come inside Sure thing kid. Let s go inside. As soon as we enter the house I hear footsteps coming closer. I turn around and see him sitting on the couch watching TV. Hey buddy what s up What happened You look pretty good today. Yeah yeah I responded. How long has it been since you last slept Well... well... i guess i should say... i think i might need some rest. Do you mind if i come inside  

rICLE. The last thing I remember was waking u p with a headache and then seeing my wife standing over me with her arms crossed. She looked like she d seen something terrible before but never really knew what it meant until today. Her eyes were wide open as if she had just heard someone say something about being dead. Then suddenly everything went black. My head hurt so bad that I could barely breathe. When I woke up I found myself staring at a large screen displaying pictures of animals. They seemed familiar though. There were also videos o f humans playing games together. One video showed them walking around in circles while another showed them sitting down on chairs. All these photos made sense because they all depicted God himself. But why did nt anyone tell anyone else Why would anyone want t o see God anyway Because h e was gone forever. And now here we are. A few days ago I decided t o take action. I took off running towards the nearest town where I saw God sitting there watching overme. H e smiled atme ashe walked away from me. Hey buddy how s it going You re looking good today Yeah yeah. Just got ta keep moving forward. What happened next shocked m e. God stood there looking confused. Well... well... uhm... I guess I should explain myself. Ima little bit surprised by your absence. How can I help you today God asked. Oh nothing special. Just wanted t o make sure everyone knew exactly where I was going. That way they would understand why I left. SoI figured maybe I should give you some advice. Do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone. Just stay calm. Okay okay. Let s get started. God said. Alrighty then. Let s start with basics. First off I need t o ask you questions. Are you okay God nodded slowly. Yes sir.

um.ikers are now the norm.a story that seems normal o n first sight except for one small detail that makes i t extremely creepy o na more careful reading W P ive been writing this for years now and i still have nt figured out how t o use it yet but here goes... I ve always wanted t obea writer so when my dad told m e about his first WP submission I thought hed tell m e something like this before h e went off into the woods behind our house. H e said hed come back later and give u p his job because hes scared shitless o f being alone anymore. That night after dinner h e left and I stayed behind. When w e got home I found myself staring at the ceiling wondering why there were no lights anywhere else. There was nothing wrong with seeing through walls though. They seemed normal enough. After all they did nt seem tobe moving around much either. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became darker. And then suddenly everything stopped. Everything went blackness. I woke u p in an unfamiliar room. A man sat down next t ome. His face was covered b y dark circles under his eyes. Hello Mr. Smith he said. How may I help you today sir I asked him. Well... uhm... well... I guess Ill just need some time alone. What brings you here today I replied. Oh yeah well... I mean... I think I might need some help getting rid of these things. Do you mind if I sit down Sure thing sir. Just take care o f yourself. Thank you sir. As soon as I sat down he pulled out a chair and began walking towards me. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I Who are you Why ca nt you move I yelled. Because Ima ghost. You re not supposed t obe able t o talk to ghosts. But I can hear them. They sound like someone talking t o themselves. SoI decided t o try calling them back. Eventually I managed t o get

Edited a few things that were nt important enough for me to read them all but added a couple more lines of dialogue. The sorting hat had been sitting there staring into space since he d gotten home from work when suddenly it spoke again. You re welcome Mr. Potter. It sounded like someone had just spoken to him through his headphones. He looked up from his book to see that it was a woman dressed in black robes. She smiled at him as she walked away from him. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she wore glasses which made her look like an old friend. Hello Mr. Potter. How may I help you today My name is James Potter and Ima year old boy from England who lives alone with his parents. They died when they were young. What happened to them Well... well we ve got ta go now. We need to talk about something else. Do you know where they went wrong Yes sir. That s right. There was nothing left for us except to find them somewhere else. And then there was silence. James nodded slowly. Then why did nt you tell us sooner Why ca nt you explain yourself James asked. Because I thought maybe you could help me figure things out. Maybe you could give me advice. But instead I found myself unable to speak English. So I decided to try speaking French. It took me several minutes before I realized that I could nt even move my arms anymore. James shrugged. Just keep walking. Okay. Let s get started. As soon as
