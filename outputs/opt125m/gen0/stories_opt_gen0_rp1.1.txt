Im not sure if this is really a prompt but Ive got an idea. I know its not exactly what you want to read but it seems like it would fit.      I dont think anyone has ever written a story where the protagonist is actually in control of the situation. It was just a way of making the reader feel more at ease.      I am trying to write about a man who gets lost while writing a story and Ive been having trouble. The problem is that I cant find him. I can only make out his name but he doesnt appear to be there.      Im trying to get back into writing and Im having trouble getting back into it. I have no idea where I am or how I ended up here. I tried to talk to a doctor but they told me to stop trying to help me.      Im not sure how long Ive been writing this and Im not sure how long Ive been writing. I hope I can keep writing until I am bored and that I can finally get home.      Im writing from my phone and Im going to take a nap. Im sorry for the inconvenience.      Im writing from my phone and Im going to take a nap. Im sorry for the inconvenience.      Im writing from my phone and Im going to take a nap. Im sorry for the inconvenience.

.A few words needed to be said before this is done and I ll have to rewrite the whole thing.   .Taste of the World    There is a reason why we are here  to create this world. It has no other lifeforms than us and that means it must be able to sustain life for hundreds of years. We can not leave it. So we must try to grow. And grow. And grow. And grow. And grow. We must find a way to make this world more beautiful more alive more livable more lively. I will be going home to my parents when I get back and they will be happy to see me. I will go to school and learn how to use the skills I learned and I will become an artist.   .The Myth of Magic    This world has many myths and stories and they all start with a child and their magic circle. These myths and stories are one and the same  They are made up to scare people away from magic. The myth is that the circle is made up of a living creature a living object or something else. The myth is that the circle is made up of everything from plants to animals from even the smallest part of the circle to the most important part. And so a child with hisher magic circle is created. And so on and so forth. But after a few thousand years there is only one thing left. The circle.   .The Myth of Magic    When a child is born heshe develops a powerful magic circle that makes himher into a living creature. Heshe becomes a tree a grass a flower a bird a spider a frog a duck a man a woman a dog a rabbit a chicken a fish a bird a fish a snake a dragon a shark a scorpion a gorilla a horse a spider a bird a lion a crocodile a man a dog a horse a lion a snake a tiger a monkey a dog a cat a mouse

You know we could be a bit better...  I sighed as I made my way over to the sleeping quarters  Dont worry about me. Its just a matter of time before they find us and kill me.     You dont think that would help us  A voice echoed in the back of the ship. The small group had gathered around me to hear my thoughts.    No I dont think it will help us. Were only here for the job.    I glanced over at the sleeping sleeping quarters. They were empty save for the small ship and its crew. The only other survivor was a small girl a few inches from my face. Her eyes were blue with tears streaming down her face. She had been taken by the aliens who captured her when she was nine years old.    My life is worthless to you  She cried out as I took a deep breath. She didnt sound like much older than I remembered.    Im sorry. Its just... I just cant do this anymore. I have to go back to the world that I love and I cant live without you.    She looked up at me with a tear running down her face.    Please let me go. Ive missed you so much.     Please let me go  She cried out again. I looked up at her her eyes were red and she was sobbing harder now.    Please  She cried out again. I held her hand and looked down at her. She was crying now too and I could feel my heart racing faster than ever.    Why  I asked holding her hand.    Because I love you  she said softly.    I love you too.  I closed my eyes and we were both alone again. 

My feet were numb my head throbbed my vision was blurred. I could feel the heat of the fire in my eyes the smell of burning wood and the scent of charred flesh. But it all made sense now. The dogs had gone. They d gone to hell. And now theyre coming for me.   My legs shook as I stepped into the kitchen. It wasnt the fire that killed them. It was the dog.    Shut the dog up.    My head hung low. I was alone in this room staring at a broken clock. I could hear the faint sound of sirens. The dog would be here soon or so I thought.   My eyes fluttered open.   A man stood there his face obscured by smoke from a small fire in the corner of the room. He was dressed in a dark blue shirt and black pants with white slacks. His head was bowed his hands clasped together. His gaze fell on me.    What are you doing  he asked voice shaking.    Im sorry sir. Im justI didnt see anything.     How do you know     Ive never seen anything like this before  he said shaking his head.  I saw it happen. It was an accident. Im sorry.    I felt a sudden chill run down my spine. I knew that feeling. I had known it since the first day I had been brought back from the dead. I had known it since I was a child. I had known that it was real. I had known that the dog was coming for me.    I ll get it  I said pulling myself up off the floor.   I took a step forward and a woman ran towards me. She wore a tight black dress her hair flowing behind her and she wore a silver hat. Her eyes were red and wet. She gave me a dirty look.  Why are you in my house 

. I dont know how he found out about my powers but he did it anyway.  . He was a little weird when he found out that I had powers.  . I have no idea how long Ive been living like this.  . I still cant believe that he found out.  . Im not even sure if I can remember what powers I have.  . If I could just find out what powers I have then maybe I would be able to help people.  .

I can smell the burning. The smell of death as it wasnt really the worst kind of death. Its not like there were any real people left just my parents and my friends. Im so close to dying but its too late for that. My mind is gone and Im no longer in control of it. I cant even remember where I am. There are no memories no memories that could be real. But it still hurts me to think about it. I dont know why I feel this way. It doesnt make sense. It didnt help me understand what I felt when I died. I didnt even know if I was dead at all.      Its been  months since Ive been here. I thought it would be hard to get used to this new reality but Im not sure anymore. I guess its hard to explain things that have happened to you in your lifetime. The first time I saw something I didnt recognize I was walking home from work when I was hit by a car. I woke up and there were bodies everywhere. I ran to the nearest hospital but they took me to the ER where I was treated for injuries that could have happened to anyone else. The doctor told me that I should be dead. He said that I had to live with the pain that had been inflicted upon me. And then he ended his life. I was stunned and scared but that wasnt my fault. I thought that he was God.      After the doctor told me that I was dead I decided to go back to work. I started working on a computer and I figured out how to access the computer. The problem was that I was able to read the words of the computer screen and use them in my thoughts. I had no idea how to change this but I knew that I wasnt alone.      After I finished writing down all the words that I was able to read I wrote down everything that I could. I wanted to know what

I  m so sorry I couldn  t help it     Yeah it was nothing.     It  s fine just keep trying to find a way to get rid of this curse.     I know I don  t want to be like that. I mean how could you     You do know what happens when you let go of the curse right     Oh yeah I know. That  s why I asked if you wanted to be with me.     Fine but I think we can be happy now.     Oh I  m glad you said that.     I know but it  s just... that doesn  t make any sense.     I know but it  s still not like you didn  t already know that.     I know but I still feel like I should tell you.     I don  t really have time for this.     No I know. But it  s the only way.     Really Why would you even bother     Because it  s the only way.     You  re going to hurt me more than I  ve ever hurt anyone in my life.     You will.     Well then at least you won  t hurt me anymore.     What     You won  t hurt anyone else. All you have to do is take one step forward and I can be yours forever.     What if I don  t     Then there will be no more pain no more suffering no more sadness no more pain. Just peace.     So what are we going to do

. We are all a part of the universe but not everyone is like you. Some are better than others and some are worse. If you are a person with a higher education then you can expect to be a genius in every aspect. I am one of those who has studied physics for my entire life. The only problem is that I have no idea how I got here. My parents were a bit religious but they didnt mind it so much. I was an introvert. I wasnt social enough to ever really fit in with society but I didnt mind it at all. Thats why I came here and now I am here.  . I have spent my whole life trying to understand everything that exists. I have been doing it since birth but I dont know what makes me different. My mother was a devout Christian but she never really believed in God or the devil but her father was a staunch atheist. I had always thought that there was something else inside of us but as I grew up I started to see more and more of them. I mean they were real people but they just looked so human. I cant tell you why they look so human but I believe that it was because we could have been so much more.  . I have come to realize that I am not alone. Every day I go home and I find that I am surrounded by other people. They look different each and every day. I think they are just as human as me but I also see more and more of them everyday. When I visit the hospital I see that my parents have been dead for nearly  years. They have been in constant pain but they have no disease or death to worry about. I guess I have finally found a way to help them.  . They are still alive. I dont know what is going on but they seem to be doing well. It seems like they have been saving lives for the past  years and are slowly starting to recover. I wonder if it is their own fault that they are dying. Maybe this is just another case of the old man being a crazy. I hope so. I cant imagine what happens when you die and they decide to take

He wasnt really an old guy. He was pretty skinny about   with brown hair and blue eyes. He had been wearing black jeans and a white tshirt for almost a year now. I guess he just didnt care anymore.    Im so sorry  I said my voice cracking slightly.    You dont have to say anything.  He replied.    Dont feel bad for me  I said. I had heard that phrase before but I had never heard it before. It was kind of strange. He had said that in his previous life he was just like me. He hadnt lived forever. Not since he had died. And as much as he had he would live on for a long time.   He looked at me his eyes darkening. His skin was pale and pale his teeth crooked his eyes dull and grey. He was a ghost. I looked around trying to find a place where I could go. But I couldnt.    How many years are left  I asked him.    About two  he replied.    Whats the point  I asked.    We cant die without you.     What  I shouted. I wanted to scream.  No one can die without me.    He shook his head his voice a whisper.    Then you will live forever. You will live until you are gone. You will live until you are gone again. You will live until you are gone.     Why  I asked.    Because you are going to die.  He replied.   I looked down at myself. My body was still a skeleton but I wasnt dead. My soul was still alive. But I felt a deep pain in my chest and I tried to open my eyes. I tried to look at my surroundings. There was no room for me anywhere.    What is this  I asked.   He gave me a confused look.    What is this

So what are you trying to tell me  the man asked his eyes twinkling with excitement.    I  m trying to teach you how to use a computer     What How I meanhow do you even know about it     That  s just it You  re not supposed to know about computers     Yeah but we  ve been studying them for over two thousand years now and they still have computers.    The man paused for a moment before continuing.    And that  s why we need to get rid of all our computers. We  re not allowed to let anything go to waste and that will only make things worse.     Oh don  t worry about that  the man said as he turned towards the young girl. She was looking up at him with an expression of confusion.    WellI meanwhat am I supposed to do about it    The man sighed and turned away from her.    Wellthe computer is supposed to be able to access information stored on the Internet. It also has the ability to store data about other people and their activities. Soyou can see everything you want but you can  t control the Internet.     WellI guess I could try to talk to someone about it butmaybe it would help me...     Haha no worries Just remember that if you ever try to use a computer it won  t work out     Ohokay I guess I  ll try.     Good luck    The man left the building and headed for home.

The only thing that is comforting is that I can eat anything and everything. I mean I have everything. But its a nightmare. I need to get out of here.   I grab the phone from my pocket and dial . They answer.     What the hell  I yell.  This is a nightmare. You cant do that     Sir please.     What is wrong with me  I ask.  Its just a dream I want to eat.

I had been searching for my own body for months now. My head was empty and my heart was beating fast. I had never felt so alive in my life.   I was so close to death. It was almost as if time stopped. My eyes were closed and I could feel the cold damp air on my face.   I looked around me. It was all just a dream. There was nothing out here. Nothing that wasnt real. I didnt even have any friends. There was only myself and my dead body.   The wind blew past my face and it started to rain. As I looked down at my body I saw what I had left. A body that I had never seen before.    What the hell  I yelled but there was no reply.   I heard someone shout from the other side of the room.  Where the hell are you     No one answers. Youre dead.     Oh. I thought you died.    I stared at the corpse for a moment. Then I realized. This is not how it had all begun.   There was no way I would die.   I sat up and walked towards the exit door. I tried to look around for anyone who might know where I was going. All I found were my body my corpse and a few random pieces of paper.    Is this it  I asked myself.   Suddenly I noticed a light shining through a hole in the ceiling. I turned around and saw that there was a light in front of me.    Youve been killed     Oh.    I ran back to my house and grabbed a glass of water. As soon as I finished the water I stood up and turned around. There was a man standing there. He looked familiar but I couldnt place him.    Hello  he said.    Who are you  I asked.    I am Death. You are my corpse.     Oh. That makes sense.     Youre

I look at my reflection in the mirror and see a slightlygorgeous young man. He is standing on a wooden stump with his back to me about six feet tall. His hair has long curly locks that fall over his eyes and nose. Im not sure how he got there but it is definitely him. He has a slight slightlygorgeous smile that tells me that he is smiling.   I follow him up to the curb and pull into a small open space behind him. I stop for a moment and take a seat by the fence. As soon as I hear the sound of the car doors opening I jump out and grab hold of the little boys arm.    Hey Hey  He shouts.    Oh hey kid  I say turning around to face him.  You okay    He looks so sad.  Yeah  he says.  I just wanted to talk to you.     What did you do  I ask trying to keep a casual tone.    Nothing  he replies.  Just ran into this bush.    I look back at him. He doesnt seem surprised.  Are you okay     Yeah  he says.  Im fine.     Well where are we going     To a place called The Cave  he answers.    Where  I ask confused.    In The Cave.     Where     Theres a cave  he answers.  Its pretty big. I think its about a mile away from here.     And youre going to tell me what to do  I ask still confused.    Im going to go in there and try to find something to change your life.     How would that be     Theres a bunch of different kinds of rocks that look like a cave.     Why do you want to change my life     Because you 

.   It wasnt until I d finished my shift at the gas station when the man started to speak.    Hey you.    I nodded and said  Yeah you. What is it    He smiled and nodded and said  You know I thought we were done talking.     Huh     Yeah. Well that wasnt the case at all.     But what happened     I told him I loved him. He laughed. He smiled. He laughed and then he broke down crying.     Did you... did you say something else     No I just wanted to make sure I was okay.     Well thats nice of you.     Thank you thank you so much.    We walked into the gas station together and I looked around. There were no customers but there were people. I recognized most of them as people in their late s or early s. I walked over to one of them and whispered  Hey you.    The man looked up from his cigarette and stared at me.    I dont know.     Oh you sure did.     Thanks.     Yeah yeah.     Did you say anything else     No I just...     Thats cool.     Yeah yeah I was just wondering if you would be willing to do some work for me.     Sure thing.     So... what did you do today     Well I went to the bar and I really enjoyed myself. I had a good time.     Really     Yep I really enjoyed myself.

The wind was blowing in the valley. The hill had been cleared of dirt and the air was crisp and clear. It seemed that the wind had stopped blowing and the wind had gone. The trees were no longer tall or thin  they had become soft and warm. A little breeze blew gently through the trees which had grown green since the last time they had been there. The air was cold and the sun shone brightly against the clouds.    The man watched his wife as she drove through the woods. She wore a long coat and hat but her eyes were wide and her face covered by a tight hat. Her hair was grey and her eyes were red like the red of a young mans face. She did not look happy about it all but she kept driving even though her husband was gone. He had come home from work to find her dead. He looked at the body lying on the ground with a single tear rolling down his cheek. He turned around to see her in the distance. His eyes were dark blue and his mouth was dry. They both looked up at him eyes locked and then they looked back at each other. His eyes went wide and he started crying.     The fire was out now but the man could feel it. His hands and feet felt weak and numb. He wanted to run but his legs were heavy and his hands were shaky. He needed to go to his wife and get her help. She would be there soon but he would have to make it to her before it got too late.     The girls father sat at the table with his son. The boy was a little bigger than his sister and he was also wearing a long coat and hat. His mother was seated next to him. Her daughter was looking down at her phone. The girl didnt look happy. She was crying and the father didnt understand why. The girl didnt look angry either. She didnt look sad either. She was just scared. She didnt want to leave him alone.

So youre telling me you dont want to get married    I was not going to say yes. It would be like saying  no  but maybe I should have said yes. I mean who doesnt I just dont want to marry her. She doesnt love me and she doesnt understand the pain of losing someone you love so much.     You know what If you really want to get married you could just give up on being single forever.    It didnt make any sense. Why would she think that after all these years I d want to spend eternity with someone else instead of a husband or wife And why would she believe that shes getting married to a man who loves her and cares for her every day     Im sorry  I told her.  I just dont want to marry.    My heart sank. She hadnt even told me that. Her eyes were so wide they almost looked like she was crying. I wish I could tell her how I felt about this. Maybe I can convince her to keep going. Maybe I can convince her to stop asking me out. Maybe she can convince herself that Im just a normal person. Maybe she ll go away after I die. Maybe I ll see her again. Maybe she ll love me back. Maybe I can save her. But its not worth it. I cant let her live through this alone.     So youre telling me you dont want to get married    She smiled. It was perfect. Like a smile that can go through a womans whole life. She smiled at me. I knew she hadnt told me yet.     You know what If you really want to get married you could just give up on being single forever.    It made no sense. I thought about it for

I love you  my daughter cried out as I walked into my room. She was crying tears of joy and happiness. My wife had been on her way to work and I couldnt be happier. I d heard about the new drugs. They were so amazing that they made us immortal. We could go back in time and see all our memories. We could forget everything we knew.    Daddy  I called for my daughter. Her eyes glazed over as she looked at me. I stared at her face. The doctors said it was a miracle.    No mommy  I said.  I cant believe Im going to die today.  I took a deep breath and wiped away my tears.    Why didnt you tell me sooner  My wife asked.    It was just a bad dream. I ll get better.  I sighed and kissed my daughter goodbye.   It was the last day of school when I left home. I turned off my lights and sat down on my bed. Ive never really been good at sleeping. When I woke up I felt like I had been sleeping for years. I had to get ready and get dressed. There wasnt enough time.   As I stood up I saw my wife standing there. She looked different than usual. I tried to shake it off but her eyes wouldnt leave mine. I quickly ran toward her and pushed her aside.    I love you too Daddy.    She smiled and looked at me with her big blue eyes. I closed my eyes and let them fall asleep.                                                                 I opened my eyes and saw my daughter sitting at my

am.    Okay  I say to myself looking around for anything that might be useful.  Lets go.    The sun is setting and I am beginning to feel tired from my long sleep. I open my eyes and start to walk towards the house. There is something odd about the house it looks like it hasnt been used in centuries but it feels old. My feet are starting to ache from walking. I decide to take a look at the outside of the house. It seems completely untouched.   As I get closer I realize whats happening. The house is empty the walls are covered with dirt and dust. Everything is dark except for the moonlight. I am standing in a strange room no light source coming in or out. There is a small window that looks out into the street.   I slowly approach the window the light from the moon shines brightly in my face. As I reach the window I see a figure standing there. Its not the person but a boy. He is wearing a blue suit and red shoes.    Hello  I say.  What can I do for you    His voice is soft and sweet. Its almost as if he understands me.  I... Im sorry sir but we dont have much time.    I nod and continue walking. I know that this boy is a dangerous man. But what could possibly happen to him He is an immortal.   Suddenly the door opens and I see him. He is standing there looking at me his eyes wide and his hands shaking slightly.    Im sorry to bother you sir but I cant help you.    I turn to look at him. He is gone his body is no longer visible to anyone but me.    Why didnt you tell me sooner  I ask him.    We were just out of town. You should

...   I have been bitten by a zombie. I can not move or speak. My body is frozen in place my mouth is shut tight and my eyes are open. I hear a shrill cry of pain but I can not see. There is no way out. The bite is painful it is almost unbearable and the pain is intense. I am paralyzed in my own skin. I am a corpse.    What do you want from me  I scream as if there is nothing I could have done to stop it.   It does not come. The monster is gone. I am dead.   What do I want  I think to myself. I want to die.    I dont know what to say. The words seem so distant yet they reach me every time I try to speak them. They make me weak. They make me afraid. And then they fall away from me.   Why did you do it Why did you kill this thing  I ask myself trying to ignore the pain that burns through my skull.   But I am too weak. I am dead.   It was my fault.  I think to myself. My fault    My only option is to simply let go. It will be over soon enough.    I thought you were dead  I whisper quietly into the abyss.   But I am still dead.   It is not my fault  I think to myself feeling like I am dying again. I am dead.   I close my eyes and start to walk away. I feel like I am going to die. I am going to die.   I do not want to die.    I know its coming. I just wish it wasnt.  I tell myself.   Then I open my eyes again. There is light. I am alive.   This is it I have won  I think. The battle is over

st of January    The world was saved by Humanity today is the day we are officially saved   The world was saved by Humanity today is the day we are officially saved   I had been born into this world as my mother was pregnant with me. My father was killed in a car accident when he was young my sister wasnt quite the same age but she was the one who told me that it was time for me to be born. The only reason I couldnt wait was because I had been born three weeks after my birth. It was a bit of a shock really I knew I would never be able to tell anyone else about what happened but I just didnt care.   I was born on the day of the drawing. The day of the drawing was the day I was going to die. My mother died too and my father had been killed by an automobile. The world was saved by Humanity today is the day we are officially saved   There were a few things that people said about my life before I was born.   My father was a man who had taken great care in his life he worked hard every day to make sure everything was in order. He would always take great pride in his work but also in his workmanship. He never had much money and he rarely made enough to afford a nice home or even a family. He used to go to a university where he studied theoretical physics but that was all he ever did so he stayed there studying all day. He also never had much money to spare so he spent most of his time at the office where he worked. He didnt have much to do since he wasnt a good worker.   I had a lot of friends though which I was glad to find out about. We had a lot in common and I found out that we were both very popular. We were both incredibly talented and very creative. I liked having people around me and I liked being around others.   One day

And that was the last of the three lies...    The mans voice was muffled and his eyes were closed. He held up a hand but was unable to get up.  What are you talking about    I reached out to touch him again and he just looked at me like he had no idea what I was saying.  Dont tell me you idiot    I stood up and walked toward the door and turned around in my chair ignoring the woman who had been staring at me. She had no way of knowing I was there.    Just let me go  she said.  I wont come back here any more.    I ignored her and walked away from the room. She didnt know. The other two had heard the same thing.       rdoritales      Sorry for any grammar or spelling errors this is my first ever WP submission. Im sure its terrible.

I had been on this job for a few months now. It was a great job I could afford to take my time and relax with my family. I got paid well enough to be able to keep my family entertained. After all I was the only one who didnt get a raise.   The first week of the Purge was fairly standard. I usually stayed home and took care of my family but after a while I found myself bored and spent most of my time watching TV. The next day was the worst. I woke up at nine oclock ate breakfast and went out to eat. My mind was racing why was I in this situation I had no idea how to react to this. I decided to go out and see if I could figure out where the fight was going.   It was dark when I arrived. I had no idea what was going on. I looked around and saw nothing. I started walking towards the door and then stopped. That was when I heard it. I turned around and saw a man standing in front of me. He had a white beard and long brown hair that was covering his face. His eyes were red and his mouth was open. He seemed to be having a battle with something and it was all happening so fast.    What are you doing here  I asked.   He stared at me for a moment and then continued.    You have been chosen as our next victim. We will use your skills and experience to bring you down to your final moments. You are to stand before us and make the sacrifice. You will be given the opportunity to enter the office building that will house your body. If you are not ready to die we will allow you to go back to the office. We will kill you from behind.     So... the boss is the guy who doesnt want me dead  I said.    Yes he is.    I walked away and went back to my desk. I sat down at the chair and pulled

Well Im not the best but Ive got a job to do and you can get me a lot of money       Well if you arent the best then I ll give you a lot of money but you need to pay me       What You cant afford that       Oh Im sorry It was just an idea its a pretty cool idea actually. Its really simple and you can put some money on it       Alright I guess I ll just go home and enjoy my beer.       But Ive got work tomorrow       I know Im going home       So you just sit here all day drinking       No I dont drink at all       Then what is the point of living in this apartment       Its not even my apartment its like a house       Hey youre not doing anything wrong you just live in here       I know that       Now tell me why I shouldnt eat dinner with you instead       Because youre a loser       Well thats true I am a loser but I do have a job       I want you to help me make more money       No I want you to help me make more money I want you to help me make more money       Oh I ll do that.       Okay then. Lets go out for dinner. I ll call you later       Sure thing I ll be there.     

Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you.     Whoa  The man said  Calm down I  m not trying to scare you.  He gestured at the sky.    We were just hiking you know It  s not like we can hear anything else.     No I swear.  The man replied  I  m not listening to anything.     What are you talking about  The man said.    It  s the sound of a person screaming.     I don  t see how that is possible.     That sounds like a child  s scream.     Are you sure it wasn  t someone else  The man asked.    Not really.     Okay well let  s go back.  The man said.    Okay.    They came up to a tree. A small stream ran across the side of the forest but was quickly extinguished by a large boulder. The trail led into a clearing where a young girl was playing. She stood on a branch staring at the stream with a wide smile.    I  m sorry.  She said  I didn  t think you would come.     I  m not.  The boy said.    Oh my God  The girl said  How can you be so loud     I  m not.  The boy said.    Then why did you keep going  The girl asked.    I thought I was hearing something.     Well you were probably right  The man said.   

THE THIRD WALL HAS BEEN GONE GONE GONE MADE  The fourth wall has been breached and our world has come into physical contact with previously fictitious realities.  The media of course isnt exactly what they seem. Theyre all just a bunch of nutjobs trying to get some publicity from the internet for some new meme.        The fourth wall has been breached and our world has come into physical contact with previously fictional realities. What happens next    THE THIRD WALL HAS BEEN GONE GONE MADE   The fourth wall has been breached and our world has come into physical contact with previously fictitious realities   The media is an odd bunch really. They know a lot about the Fourth Wall but they dont know how to stop it. Its a real thing and we have to keep telling them. Weve got to be careful with the public though we ll have to be careful in the future.        I write this on my phone. Im on mobile so its kind of blurry.        I was at the park again. This time I wasnt really there anymore just standing there staring at the wall. It was like when youre in a bad mood you just want to sleep you know So I went back and sat there looking at it wondering if I should go back to sleep. But then I realized that I had a problem.   I d spent the whole afternoon staring at it and now the wall was going up in flames and I knew it wasnt supposed to happen. So I started running. I didnt even know where I was going or who I was. I was just running and I heard the loud crack of gunfire. Then I saw the wall and I knew I had to run. I ran and I ran and then I saw the wall. It

Well I have to get out of here      You know what Fuck this. I  m leaving.      I  ll go get a beer with my friends.      It  s not like I  m going anywhere      Just leave me alone.      I don  t want to go home      Do you      I don  t care if you do but you should let me go.      Fine      So you  re saying I can leave my house and live in the suburbs but when I get back I won  t be living in this apartment      That  s right.      You  re kidding me.      Why would you say that      Because it  s not like I  ve never wanted to.      What about you      You want to see me      What      You  re the one who told me to go.      But why      Because you  re a weirdo.      Really      Yes      And you  re the weirdo because you  re a fucking weirdo.      Shut up.      What did I tell you about that      It  s fine. I  m just so lonely now.      Why      I didn  t expect anyone to take me seriously.      You thought that was funny

I remember the day I was born. I remember it like it was yesterday. My parents had just died and left me to rot in a hospital bed for a few days. They were both very wealthy but they werent able to afford the expensive treatment I received that day. It took weeks before I became one of the elite. I grew up with my father who owned a small Italian restaurant. My mother worked at the local hospital and my father worked as a secretary there. They were the only two people who knew each other and the only ones who really knew each other.   I had been born in Rome when the Romans arrived. I could see their ships coming in from all directions and saw them in all directions. When I was five years old I was sent to a boarding school in Rome. My parents were also wealthy but they never paid attention to me because they believed in the Romans.   One day my father found me on the street in front of the school. He looked down at me and asked if I wanted to go to the boarding school. After a few minutes of sitting there I told him yes. He said that he would take me to a boarding school that I would be accepted into. He gave me a large bag with some clothes and a bottle of wine. I drank the wine and then sat down in the back seat.   My father took me home and gave me a small room. Inside the room was a bed and a chair. I was a little tired so I went to sleep. After I woke up my father walked around and told me about how he bought me the chair and the bed. He said that the chair was made of silver and that it had no legs. He said that when someone comes in here they will have a golden key and they will need to enter the door. The key is placed on the ground and the door is opened.   The next morning I woke up and saw that my father had taken me out to the courtyard. He said that he needed me to help him with his work. I told him that I would be leaving for a while but then my father got angry and threw me to the ground. He said that I was a waste of time and

On the day of their death every human gets to have a vision of meeting the man they could have become.   The first time I saw him was in middle school when I was . He looked like a boy with blond hair and blue eyes and he was staring at me from across the room. That night he asked for my help and I told him that he needed to be there. He said he d be okay if I hadnt already been there. I told him that I loved him and I would be there to support him through his tough times. He said he didnt want to go to school so he left for college and now we were living in a big city. I told him how I missed him how I wanted to see him again and how I wanted to be there to watch him grow up. He laughed and told me about the great things he d done to make me feel better and I told him about the way he taught me to love myself.   He was a really good person. It took me a while to realize that Im not the only one who sees him. In fact I think its all part of the whole thing. I think its all part of the way that Ive always known him. When he was younger he was the one who used to talk to me and he was the one who always got the best of me. Sometimes he d sit on the couch and listen to me telling me that he felt better than I ever had before or that he just wanted to get to know me and I would give him a hug. When I was a kid I d always hear him say those words. He d tell me that he knew I had to do what he said and he would hold me close until I woke up.   We grew apart after high school. I guess thats why Im writing this. I remember sitting next to him during lunch and he asked if I wanted anything and I obliged him. Then he was gone.   The following year I moved into a new house and met a

The root password for the universe is discovered.   This was a long hard day at work and it seemed like everything had been done wrong. We d gone over it all again and again but it still didnt make sense. After all this was the universe after all. How could we not know it    It turns out that in the beginning there were three rules to this and in order to get through each and every one of them we needed to find out the password. In the end we found out the password to our own universe.    The first rule is simple and we knew that it was true. We just need to figure out how to access it. But we also needed to know how to hack it. We had to know how to unlock it.    The second rule is incredibly complex. This was a very long hard day and it seemed like everything had been done wrong. There are three rules to it. First you must do something to stop it from happening. Second you must be able to access the password and third you must be able to access it in a way that would allow you to hack it.    As we came closer to the password we realized that it wasnt the password that made it possible. It was the password that made it possible for us to access the universe the key to unlocking it.    The key to unlocking the universe was something that we had never heard of before. A key so powerful that it could change the world forever. The key to unlocking the universe is something that we have never heard of before. It was...     Wait  I called out trying to get the key out of my hand.  Im going to have to use it now      No youre not  she said holding up her hands.  You can keep the key but only if youve unlocked it by accident.      What if I cant use it  I asked.  I ll just go home and forget about it.

I think my parents would have been very proud if they had their own little secret. I mean we all know that the one thing that makes us special is our ability to read minds and control our actions. But I never wanted to be special. I always thought I was special. And I suppose it was because Ive always known how special my life was. I d spent every waking moment learning how to use my powers and I d been blessed with all of the abilities that everyone else had. I didnt want to grow up and become an adult just because I could. I knew what I wanted I could do anything and I never wanted to grow up to be someone like my father or grandfather. I had to learn to make things better. I had to become better than everyone else. I had to be a better person. I had to be a better man. I could do anything      I could do anything I could make people happy make them feel good make them feel safe make them feel safe and everything in between I could make them feel safe I could do anything I could do anything I could do anything I could do anything      I could make people happy I could make people happy I could make people happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy      I could make people happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy      I could make people happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy I could make them happy

.   Im not going to lie Im pretty good at it. But Ive never been able to get it right. Im not the smartest but I dont have a lot of friends either so I have no real interest in getting into the game. The first few times I tried to get my life back on track I was able to survive for almost three days before the next one popped up. But I could never be good enough for the other players. And now here I am trying to get back on track by being revived and only having a couple of minutes left to live.   .   The next time I try to revive someone it just keeps coming back. Its not just some random popup that pops up every time. Its something that happens all the time. I know I shouldnt try to revive people after they die but I cant help myself. Every time I try to revive someone it just happens again.   .   When I tried to revive myself once it just happened again. I was able to survive for a while after the first one but I couldnt even get my life back on track. And then I tried to revive myself twice more but this time it just happened again. And again. And again.   .   I cant really remember how many times Ive tried to revive myself but Im pretty sure Ive gotten it a hundred or two times. Maybe its just the game I ll never know. Maybe Im just playing stupid.   .   I can see why they keep reanimating me. I cant remember anything about my past lives. But Ive been alive for almost a year and I know everything about my past lives. Im basically immortal. Ive been alive for nearly two years now and I know all of my past lives. Ive also been able to stop time for nearly seven months. And I know exactly what time I respawn.   .   I cant believe that

My heart was beating faster. I had heard the stories of people who couldnt live forever but to me it seemed like a dream. Maybe they were right. Maybe they were wrong. I didnt care I just wanted to go home.    Hey hey hey  I yelled at my mom as she ran from the door stopping by the bathroom to wash her hands before leaving for work. She looked so much older than me now.    Hey  she said again walking over to the sink.  Whats up     Its me mom  I said standing up.    Where are you  She asked.    Home.  I said.    Mom  She asked.    Yes     Where am I     I dont know  I said.    Oh Im sorry.  She said reaching into the drawer on the other side of the room. She pulled out an envelope and opened it reading     Dear God    We are so sorry to hear that you have passed away.    Please take this letter with you to your family where we can say goodbye.      The world is full of wonderful people. I love you.      You are a very special person.      Your mother is still in the hospital and we hope that you will be able to visit soon.      Thank you for your understanding.      Love      Your sister        Mom      Your brother        Your father        Our hearts are with you.      Our love      Your sister        Mom        Our love        Your brother        Our hearts are with you.      Mom 

What  I said aloud to no one in particular. I had been waiting for this moment for years. It wasnt long before my parents were arrested for stealing their daughters car. Then it happened. A big bank robbery. An attack on a bank. It was just too much.   I didnt think that I could have done it. That I wouldnt be able to save everyone. But I did what needed to be done. I took a huge chunk out of the criminal mastermind known as The Keymaster. He had been one of the most powerful villains in the world. I figured he would just be another villain.   And then he came along. A young man with blue hair and a scar that looked like it belonged to someone else. I thought he might be an old friend. Maybe he was a hero.   I knew that I shouldnt have taken him down. I knew that if he were to die I would be dead. So I made sure I was going to kill him. I shot his head off grabbed some rope and tied it around his neck. I was ready.   I stabbed him in the neck with my knife. His head had gotten stuck in the ice that he was in. I watched him bleed out trying to find any kind of reason to survive. Then I stabbed him again and again but this time I wanted to make sure he wouldnt get into any trouble.   But this time it was different. He was still alive. He tried to talk but I cut him off with the knife. He tried to fight me but I cut him off first. This time he was really strong.   I used his blood as a shield. I used the blade to stab at his heart but he stopped bleeding. I left him there but I didnt want to take away his life. I couldnt leave him alone. I just wanted to keep him safe.   I killed him and then left. I walked to the main building and opened the door. I stepped inside and went through the security gate. There was a group of supervillains guarding the entrance. They were armed

What do you mean Im dead     I said yes.     Well that was a little confusing.     Yeah well that was.     But how did I die     Its not a question.     Well its been a while since Ive had one of those.     Oh right.     So youre saying... well I died and... uh... I...     Thats right. Well it turns out that God exists.     No really. Thats all Im saying. Its just... I wasnt in Hell or anything so... well I wasnt exactly... I wasnt quite dead but I was definitely alive.     But why     It was my time to go. I wasnt in heaven but I wasnt on earth either. So I just went along with it.     Ah okay then I guess you ll have to explain yourself.     Im not sure. It was pretty dark outside and I was a bit cold. I mean I knew I shouldnt have gone but I still did.     Right. Well there was this other place like... like heaven. And I just wanted to go. To wherever I was going.     And what was that     A portal. A portal to hell. A place where people could go wherever they wanted. It looked pretty good actually.     Okay. So I went through there. I was a little worried that maybe I would be in hell and I thought I d be fine here.     Yeah. Well that was a little weird. I didnt really want to go to hell but I felt bad about it anyway. So I decided to go. But after a

I am immortal I have lived my entire life in a perfect world.  This is not what I expected.  I am dead.  I am immortal.  But not dead.

Theres something in the air. It makes me feel like Im floating above the ocean. Ive been hunting for years but never have I seen something so incredible as this.   Ive always wanted to be a god but Ive always felt that I was destined to be something more than just a myth. To be the most powerful being in the universe. To be the most feared being in existence. The one who can kill a man with his bare hands. The one who can make things happen.   Its like Im in control of my own destiny. I am God. And I know that I am going to be able to do what no one else has ever done before. I will not die or be forgotten. I will be immortal. I will become a god.   I am the God of Thunder.

I say almost out of breath.    But weve been fighting for months now. I just need to get through this one.  He replies.    Youre the hero of Gotham Mr. Wayne. You know that.     What No. Im not. Im just trying to get through this one.     Okay then. Let me finish.  He says pointing towards the door.  Youre the hero of Gotham. Youre supposed to protect me.     Well... Im not going to hurt you.  I reply more surprised than angry.    No Im not. And you cant.  He replies clearly confused.    No Im not. But Im not going to hurt you either.

I  m writing this to you. I just wanted to say that I love you. I don  t know how you can be so cruel and yet so kind to me. I  ve been through so much and I still feel like my life has been worth living for. It seems like such a long time ago now. You  re not even the first person I  ve been with but you are the first I  ve ever met. I miss you so much you  re the one who has been there for me. I  m sorry that I  m leaving you behind. I love you.   I was born in a family of  and I lived my life as a normal man. My father a good man was an accountant and his mother was a law student. They were good people and had a lot of money and they would give anything for their child. But then they got sick and they died. I didn  t have a choice and I was left alone.   So I was at home with my family eating cereal and watching cartoons when suddenly I felt something in the back of my mind. The same feeling I get every night. This time it was something more intense than the feeling of my own life. A feeling that I had never experienced before. Something powerful. I thought it was just a dream and then I realized it was real. The feeling of a giant monster something that was bigger than any other person I  ve ever known standing over me looking into my soul. I couldn  t stop myself from screaming and I started crying. I screamed at the top of my lungs. I yelled for the monster to get out of my house. I yelled to the monster that I was a monster and that I wasn  t going away and that I was just going to wait for him. I screamed at the monster and he came closer. He said  You  re not a monster you  re a human. You  re just a human.  Then he killed me and I cried. I cried until I couldn  t cry anymore and finally I was

Were gon na get this place cleaned up and we ll be back tomorrow  he told me. I turned the radio on and listened to my old friends voice over the radio.   Thats what you always said  he continued.    And youre right. Weve got it all cleaned up  I replied.    Then why d you turn off the radio  he asked.    Because it was getting late  I responded.  But I guess I was just excited to see you again.    I turned off the radio and walked out of the room. I felt like I could go back to my childhood but that wasnt real. I thought of a future where my friends and I would be together again. It would be perfect.   I walked into the kitchen to find myself standing in front of the fridge.    Hey  I called out to my best friend.    What are you doing here  I yelled back.    Im at work  he said.    What  I asked.    Come on  he said.  Youre going to be late for work anyway.    I had been working for two years when my mother passed away. She was an amazing person but she left me with only a few years left to live. I never knew her well enough to understand how much I missed her. I had no idea what life was like without her.    Mom  I said.   He looked at me.  Do you remember the first time I saw you     Yeah  I answered.   He nodded.  When were you born     When I was three  I replied.  I was so scared that I forgot about your birthday. I wanted you to go out there and have some fun and I could n

We are the ones who have the power to make the world stronger and smarter We can save the world     There was an uproar when the aliens were discovered but were not going to bore you with that right now.      The only way to stop them is to create a magical machine where they will never be able to destroy us again     The machine was made to protect us from the dangers of war so it couldnt harm anyone else but some people argued that it would be more effective than magic. It didnt work for me.    The creatures that live inside of the machine are called... dragons     Dragons were actually the ones who invented it. You can read about them here.    They were originally made from dragon bones which were found buried beneath the earth. They became known as... dragons.     There are also rumors that the dragons were actually part of a cult or something. The cultists believe that they worshiped the dragons.    The dragons are the monsters that inhabit the earth If they dont get out soon we will all die     There is no reason to believe that they arent real.    We can save the world We will all be better off if we do     Im not sure what the hell this means.    If the dragons dont get out soon then we will all die     I havent heard of any other creatures that can do this.    Its almost like the machines are trying to stop us from killing each other     I think its pretty clear that the dragons arent real.    But how     The machine is powered by magic. Magic is literally a physical force that makes everything around it selfaware. Magic is powerful enough to kill and the more powerful the magic the faster it starts to grow and the longer it takes the energy to keep it growing.  

Its been a long time since Ive seen this    I looked back at the scene in front of me. It was a beautiful day. The sun had just started its slow descent down into the sea and the waves were just beginning to rise. The wind was blowing gently off the waves and they seemed to be moving towards us. I thought about what I would do if we found out what had happened. I would go and find out.   I turned back to the scene. It was a small simple butterfly that floated slowly up towards the sky. It had no wings but it did have a long flowing tail. It was the same color as the ocean which was almost completely blue. I had never seen it before but I knew it was there. Thats when I saw it. It was so large that it could have easily weighed a tonne of people. It was also very dark and the only light coming from the horizon was through the trees. I was too scared to look away but I noticed something on the ground.   I stood up my feet sinking into the soft grass and walked over to the butterfly. I stared at it for a few seconds. The whole thing was so huge and yet so small. I picked it up and let it fly around the grass. Then I walked over to the butterfly and I took a bite out of it. Then I took another bite out of it. Then I turned to leave.   I hope you enjoy your stay Youre going to love it here    I turned back to the butterfly. It was still there and it was flying around the grass. I looked up and I saw two other butterflies. They both flew toward me. One was much bigger than the other. Then I ran over to it and I ate it. The butterflies were all gone.   I left the place and I went to the nearest cafe. I got a coffee and an old book from my old teacher and went to bed. 

I am Death.    A single word escaped from my mouth. I couldnt make it out but Death spoke again.  We have come for you Jedi Knight. We are here to end your life.    I looked around me. There was no one else in sight so I didnt know how to say anything. Death spoke again.  We have come for you Jedi Knight. We are here to end your life.    I stared at him for a moment longer. I could tell that he had been talking to me through his words. I looked back up at him waiting for a response. Finally Death spoke again.  We have come for you Jedi Knight. We are here to end your life.    I looked back up at him again. Finally Death spoke again.  We have come for you Jedi Knight. We are here to end your life.    I looked back down at the floor. I couldnt believe my eyes. I was in a black void with nothing left to see but deaths face. Death took a step back. I took another.  We have come for you Jedi Knight. We are here to end your life.    Death stood there for a moment still unsure of what to do. I saw the confusion on his face again. This time Death was even more confused. His voice was deeper than usual. I heard him sigh.  You are dead Jedi Knight. Your last act of kindness was to kill yourself.    I felt a pang of guilt as I felt the pain of my death grow. I knew that Death would be the one who ended my life but I also knew that I would die alone. I never thought I would see him again. 

I opened it up and read the contents of the envelope. Inside was a copy of the job offer from the company.  We have a special offer for you  he said.

However if you do not agree to this offer we will be unable to help you get another job. If you do not accept we will not be able to help you.    As soon as I had finished reading the terms of the contract I began taking my lunch. As I made my way down to the elevator I saw the man standing there. He wore a thick black suit and carried a large letter in his hand. It said  TSINGELHURYOTIHAD  in big bold and red letters.   I looked around the room and noticed that all of the chairs were empty. I walked over to him and sat down next to him. I asked him what his name was and he explained that he was the one who would lead me to where I wanted to go. He then told me that I had been chosen for this position because I would prove that I am worthy.    Oh hey  I said  Im sorry to bother you.    He smiled.  Oh come on  he said.  Lets go get some food shall we    We continued walking through the restaurant until we came upon a large open door that led us into a large room. There were chairs and tables set up in front of the door and people all sitting in the seats. A woman with blonde hair and glasses entered the room and took off her glasses. She looked familiar.    You seem like a good candidate  she said.  I think I ll try to get you a job.     Oh no problem  I replied  I d really appreciate it.

The city was filled with the sounds of the waves crashing against the sea. The buildings were crumbling and the sidewalks were cracked and broken. It had been a long time since anyone had visited this place but there was no other reason for that. It was beautiful but not as grand or spectacular as it used to be.    Oh god.  I said standing up from my seat at the foot of the stairs.  Where did they go What happened    I took one last look around then turned back to the portal. I heard it crackle shut behind me but it wasnt there. It wasnt anywhere near as magnificent as it once seemed.    I dont know. Maybe someone is going to find us but... maybe someone will find us.  I said looking over my shoulder towards the street below.   I knew what I had to do. I would get to the portal and I would be free. I could live a happy life without the constant terror of being trapped in a giant city.   I stood up and walked over to the portal. I was ready to go but my mind raced. There was something about this place it felt familiar. The buildings were all crumbling and the streets were cracked and broken. It had been a long time since anyone had visited this place but there was no other reason for that. It was beautiful but not as grand or spectacular as it used to be.   I looked around again and found myself sitting on a bench in the middle of the street surrounded by people. I walked towards them and looked around again. My eyes widened when I saw a young girl running towards me. She was wearing a green sundress and she looked like she was about five years old. She was holding a small box that looked almost identical to her parentsbox. Her hair was a bright red and she wore a smile on her face.    I just want to see you  she said holding out her hand.    Why are you here  I asked.    I just want to see

AM    Were getting a little heated here and I really dont think that we can handle this. You know we just came from a time where people didnt want to be in charge anymore so we decided to have a second term.     AM    We can use Kanye West as our vice president and Taylor Swift as our first lady. If you win then we ll make sure she gets a second term. And if you lose... well you cant run for president without being a total asshole.     AM    No no no no no no We need to get it over with before the election is even over because we cant be elected into office by any means. Theres got to be some other way.     AM    Lets not get ahead of ourselves okay Theres got to be a way. Weve been through this all along. We just cant let the world go to shit without us being in charge. Its too late now and thats why were here.     AM    Thank you everyone. Now let me start by explaining what this is going to look like. The second term is a lot longer than the first one. Weve been through hell. I mean its funny how you guys always say that were the bad guys. But were actually the good guys right Like we were the bad guys when we took over.     AM    Weve already spent about three months trying to stop you and weve gotten pretty close. But as soon as we figure out what were doing its going to be very hard.     AM    And weve already made sure that youre the next president. Weve tried everything to try and get you to take over

The world was dark and cold when I woke up. My body ached and my mind hurt as I tried to figure out how to move. A man stood there staring at me. He wore a white robe and had a black one. He looked familiar but I couldnt place it. He looked like me but I couldnt place him.    Hello  he said.    Hello  I said.   He looked down at his feet and looked back up at me.  Can you hear me     Yeah  I said.    Can you hear me  he asked again.    Yeah  I said.   He looked down at his feet again and looked back up at me.  Can you hear me  he asked again.

It was cold but the air was warm and the sun had just started to rise.    The sun is out  My friend said.  Ive been waiting for you guys to come out here and tell me what happened.     I dont know  My friend said.  They seem to have left our city behind theyre leaving us alone.     No Youre not going to leave us alone  My friend said.  Were going to find a way to get home    I stood up and tried to move towards the door. It was locked so I opened it a little. I walked in and saw my friends standing there arms crossed. Their faces were bloodshot and their lips red. I looked over at my friend and then realized he was holding a gun to my head.    Please  I said  You can go back to sleep.     Yeah  his voice was shaky.  We ll get home soon.    I took off into the darkness and then we were right where we wanted to be. We were on our way to an abandoned settlement. We were heading home.     Where are we going  My friend asked.    I dont know  I said.  I dont know     We ll find a way to get home  My friend said.  We ll find a way to get home     No  My friend said.

month later  The scientists had managed to create a virus that would infect any living being on Earth. They were able to get the virus into their system and then replicate it using the cells of every living being on Earth. All they needed was one person who could carry this virus.   month later  The scientists managed to make the virus into a vaccine. It was a small shot at the virus and it would only spread if it was fatal. They sent out an expedition to Mars in hopes of bringing it back to life. After  months the virus had been eliminated and the vaccines were ready to go. The mission was set up and the first colonists would be arriving shortly.  The first colonists were selected by a lottery. Each person received a one month supply of the virus and then they would be transported to Mars to be inoculated against it. The next day the first colonists arrived. The first group was a group of  people.   days later  Everyone was given the vaccine. The first person to get the vaccine was the first human to receive it. It was administered to everyone within  miles of the base. They were administered the vaccine and the first person to be vaccinated was the first person to be infected with the virus.   days after the vaccine was administered everyone was taken to the base where the remaining  were taken to be inoculated. It was then that all of the first person were injected with the vaccine. Everyone then turned to the base where the remaining  were being administered. The  were then administered the vaccine and then transferred to the base. Once again the  were injected with the vaccine.  The  were then administered the vaccine and then transferred to the base. Once again the  were injected with the vaccine.   month later  They took the first  and the second . They then transferred them to the base and then made the third . Once again the  were injected with the vaccine. This time the first  were injected with the vaccine. Again they were injected with the vaccine. This time the first  were injected with the vaccine.   month later  The first  were injected with the vaccine. Again

The apparition looked more like a man with a black suit and a beard. He was dressed in a black robe and had a clipboard in his hand.  You may go now.  The apparition said in a voice that sounded a bit more like a doctor.   I looked at my feet it was cold and my hands were shaking. I felt something warm on my arm and turned around. There was a man standing behind me. His skin was pale his hair was thick and he wore a dark leather jacket. I noticed his eyes were wide and the corners of his mouth twisted in a smile.    Welcome back Mr. Baker.     I am dead     Yes.     Thats great but whats the catch     Im not sure.     What do you mean     You can die for five years.

I looked down at my feet they were still cold and my hands were shaking. I tried to sit up but my legs were too weak.    Wait so Im immortal     No.     Why     Because Im immortal.     What     Because youre immortal.     So     Youre immortal.     Im dead     Yes but only if you choose to.     I have no choice     You have one choice Mr. Baker. Your life is over.

... ... ... ...   I stared at the mark for what felt like an eternity. It wasnt until I could feel my heart beating that I noticed something. The mark on my hand was red and the mark on my arm was green. I didnt know what to do so I just kept staring at it trying to get some idea of what it meant. Finally when my eyes adjusted I realized that I was looking at my own arm.   Dingdong    Hey buddy  said the voice from behind me.  Who are you    My eyes snapped open and I started to run but I stopped dead in my tracks.    Im your father  I said slowly walking towards him.  And Im sorry I didnt mean to scare you.    He nodded slowly as if he were not aware of my presence.  Im not going to scare you. I promise.    I looked around trying to see anything that might help. After a few minutes I found a small patch of grass and a tree branch. I tried to climb the branch but it was too late.    What are you doing here  I asked.    Im going to kill you  said the voice from behind me.    No no no I wont  I said.  Ive done everything for you. I have saved your life countless times.     But Im your father  I shouted.  My father has killed thousands of people. Why should I give up his life    The man stood back up and began pacing around.  I ll show you why.    I stood there watching as he walked away.  Then lets go get some food.    The man walked out of the way and made his way down the hill. I followed suit and soon I was at my fathers side.  

Oh fuck.    I sighed and turned around. The monster was still there. It looked like it had been following me for about twenty minutes but I couldn  t tell if it was the time or not. My room was dark and my clothes were soaked. There was a table in front of me next to which was a bed and a chair. I sat up and grabbed a book from the shelf and started flipping through it. The monster had already fallen asleep but I could still hear him breathing. I turned on the light and waited for him to wake up. He didn  t.         You know what Fuck it.    I walked out of my room and walked down the hallway to the bedroom. I took a step back and stared at the monster in my closet. It was a large creature that probably weighed at least a ton and was wearing a long white robe. It was completely naked except for its huge red eyes which seemed to stare right into my soul. The monster had a thick black beard and wore a long black cape. It also wore glasses which were covered by a thick layer of dirt. It had a small scar running across the left side of its face and it  s blue eyes glowed in the darkness.    Fuck  I muttered.  I better go to sleep.  I turned back to the bed and walked over to it. I got on top and pulled it out. I threw the blanket over my head and ran my hand along the length of it. Then I opened the door and stepped inside. I had no idea what to expect. It was an office space with a giant desk and a couch. It was very close to my home but I wasn  t expecting it to be that far away.   I walked into the room and found myself staring at the desk. The monster was sitting in a chair which was covered in a thick layer of dirt. Its red eyes looked like they were staring directly into my soul.

I had been sitting alone on my bed trying to think of something to say but couldnt. My friend came over and put a hand on my shoulder.  Can you hear me     Yes.  I replied.       Okay  he said as he pulled out his phone. He opened up a text from him.  Its time for you to go.       I started thinking about what to do.  What if I told you that I have a girlfriend     Im sure your girlfriend is an amazing woman. I d love to see her again but I cant promise anything.       I decided that I would ask her out once more. After all she was my best friend right I decided that she might be able to help me with whatever I was going through. The phone rang again. I picked it up.       Hey. Hey Are you there  I called back.    Yeah. Hey are you alright  She answered.       Hi  I said smiling at her.  How d you get here     I dont know. Ive been trying to find you for hours.     Oh.  She responded  Well how did you find me     I didnt. I just thought I should tell you.        Do you ever forget how you met  She asked looking at me.  Im not sure I can say I remember.        Youre going to need to come with us now. We dont have much time.  She said leaning forward.    Oh.       She went back to her room. She had a large box with some old clothes in it. They were heavy but she didnt mind. Her bed was cold but she didnt mind it too much. She tucked herself

The old man sat at his desk writing a note to himself. He had been working as an accountant for the last ten years. This was the beginning of it all and he knew what it meant.    I am God.    A smile came across his face and he knew that this was it. It was all he had left.       What can I do for you  asked God.    Im sorry but I dont have any money.     You are a very old man.     I... I dont know.    God looked up at the sky. The world was silent. He was sitting in a small room with only the sun setting. There was no moon. He felt a lump in his throat and he couldnt breathe.    Please God dont make me do anything I dont want to die    God stared at him confused. He wanted to ask again but there was no way that would work.    Why isnt there any moon     It wasnt there yesterday.     I saw the moon once once. It was beautiful. And now its gone.    Gods heart began to pound in his chest. He couldnt live without it. He needed it. He didnt have much time left.    I cant go. I have to go. Please god please dont make me do anything     I can.    He turned and ran off into the darkness away from the sun. He never expected to see the sunrise again not after the events that had transpired the previous night.

I was sitting in my car on the side of the road thinking about all the things I had done. It was only a couple of weeks ago when I started drinking and driving my car into the trees. After some time I finally managed to get out of my car. I looked over at the young woman with her face full of concern and saw that she was smiling. She ran towards me and held out her hand.  Come with me  she said.   I obliged and followed her. She led me along a small trail that lead into an abandoned forest. The forest was large and covered in vines and moss. The ground was hardwood and grassy but it seemed to be dry enough for me to walk on. The forest was a beautiful place to walk but it didnt seem as inviting or welcoming as it should have been.   As we approached the top of the hill I noticed that the forest was growing thicker. I thought about running away from it but I was already running late. My mind raced as I came across a large cave system in the distance. It was huge and I could see everything that was going to happen if I stayed there for longer than necessary. I kept walking and eventually reached the cave.   A figure sat atop a rock face. His skin was pale his eyes were yellowish and his mouth was red. He was wearing a red hat that appeared to be made of a strange material. I couldnt understand what he was saying but I heard him say something. I started to move forward but stopped as he spoke.    What are you doing here  I asked.    Im here to take a look at this cave. I want to know what happened here.     Are you sure you dont mean...     Yes. Ive never seen anything like it before.     You have to be kidding me.     Im serious. There is a door in here.     What     Ive never

PM   Im a little late but it seems like only one man had the time to write that one.    Hes an idiot.     He should have killed himself     No.    I sigh heavily and look up at my wife. She was so beautiful in those eyes. Her dark hair her pale skin all that goodlooking stuff you see in magazines. But not this man. This is a man who can do nothing but stand there and listen staring at his own reflection. The way he talks... not a word. Not even a whisper.    Why  I ask.    Because hes too much of a coward.     How dare he     You know I cant kill him and he wont die.     He ll get away with it right     Hes not.     Then let him live.     But what if he dies before we do     He wont.     Dont tell me what to do.    I stare at my wife unable to hold back tears.    What will you do     Go home and pretend you didnt hear him.    I stare at her dumbfounded.    What do you mean youre not going home     Im going to be dead.     What are you talking about     Im going to die.    I turn to face my husband. His body still stands there as if he never existed. And his hands are shaking. Hes holding on to something. I cant understand why he would want to end his life but he does.    No.     He will.    I look down at my husband trying to make sense of all the details.    You can be a murderer now.    

You can have any wish it said. I ll give you whatever you want.  No matter what I ll give you anything.  But... but... youre a genie   NO   Then tell me what will happen to me   Well Ive always been afraid of being alone I guess.  Youre not alone. There are other genies out there I dont need them to grant my wishes though.  Why not   I cant give you anything. Im just a genie. I dont give up anything.   So... why is that so important   Because Im only human. Im the first genie in the history of mankind. Why dont you want to get a wish   Yes of course I can grant any wish I want. But you must do it by me.   Why not   Because Im a genie and I cant grant wishes.  What about this wish   Oh well I wish to be the adult I thought I was. What does it say   It says  To all who wish for me I give you this wish. If you do not wish to grant my wish I will not grant it. I am a genie after all. And if I do not grant your wish I shall not grant it. In fact I am the genie after all.  How can I grant your wish   Im not a genie. Im just a genie. No you can not grant my wish.   Why should I   Because Im a genie. I cant grant your wish.   But I can grant yours   I know youre thinking  No  but that doesnt make me a genie right   Im

It was a Sunday night when I first saw him. He was standing in the corner of my living room his grey hair whipping about in the wind as he passed by. His eyes were full of the same intensity as mine and he had a strange odd sense of humour. He told me to sit down next to him and talk to him for a few minutes.    Hi there.  He said giving me a warm smile.  Im Lucifer.     Youre... what  I asked incredulously.    Im Satan.  He said.  My name is Lucifer.     And...  I began.    Yes yes its a good question.  He replied.  The first thing you need to do is ask your friend over there.    A few seconds later I was sitting on the couch in my bedroom watching TV. My wife sat in front of me her hair falling behind her head. She looked like she wanted to sleep but I couldnt help but look at her with a look of confusion.    Whats wrong  I asked.    Oh nothing really. Nothing. Just... just a few more hours.  He said.   I was dumbfounded. Why did this man have so much energy in him Why did he appear so slow and relaxed I started to think that maybe he had a heart condition or something.    Hey  He said.  Come on lets go get some coffee.    I did as he instructed. As we walked out of the kitchen he handed me a cup and poured himself a glass of water.    So youre telling me that Im the last person on Earth  I asked.    Yeah  He said.  It seems like thats true.     Well Im sure you ll all want to hear it.    We both got up from our chairs and headed for the door.    Wait  He

Im going to die thought I as I slipped into my bed.   Oh god oh god...  I groaned as I looked at myself. I had been on a diet for almost five years now but today was the first time I was actually looking at myself. Oh god.... oh god.... oh god.... oh god.... oh god.... oh god... oh god.... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh god... oh

I was once a boy now I am old and I have come across a man in an old suit. He was a merchant who gave me gold for my service at a church. Now he is a stranger and I see him. He looks at me and I understand. This is not the time for this. This is not the time for this. The man in the suit is Santa Claus.    You are old and you have come across a man in an old suit.  The old man says as he reaches out with his hand.  You know not what you have done. You know not what you have done. But you do not know. You have not seen the man in the suit nor you know how to stop him. And yet you do not know.    I feel like a ghost. I have been here before. I have seen the man in the suit but I have not felt it. Not the coldness of his presence or the coldness of his words nor the softness of his smile nor the softness of his eyes. I am not Santa Claus.    No  the old man says.  It is not that. It is not that. It is not that.    I look down at the bill in my hands and I see it. It isnt gold. It isnt silver. It isnt copper. It isnt copper. It isnt silver. It isnt copper. It isnt silver. It isnt gold. It isnt silver.    You are old and you have come across a man in an old suit. You know not what you have done. You know not what you have done. But you do not know. You have not seen the man in the suit nor you know how to stop him. And yet you do not know. You do not know.    I am cold. My heart is beating fast. My skin is raw. I am angry. I am scared. I am afraid. I am hungry. I am thirsty. I am hungry.

....   I awoke with a start. I had just awoken from a dream. The ship was glowing red and the sun was shining through the window. I looked around me at the rest of the people in my small pod some with their faces buried in their phones others staring at me as if they were scared of me. As if they were afraid of me. I looked up at the sky and smiled at the stars. They seemed so beautiful.    Hello  I shouted to no one in particular though I could feel my face getting hot.  Im here for you     What  A voice called out from behind me.    Please sit down  I said trying to sit up. I didnt want anyone to hear what I had to say.   The pod was silent for a moment. I opened my eyes to see what was happening. It was dark. It was cold.   I looked at the man standing in front of me his hair flowing behind him. He wore a suit of white with a blue tie. He wore a black hat that covered his head. He wore a suit of grey with a black hat covering his face. His hair was a dark grey and he wore a black hat. He wore a suit of green with a black hat covering his face. He wore a black suit of white with a black hat covering his face. He wore a black suit of green with a black suit of white with a black suit of green. He wore a black suit of white with a black suit of white with a black suit of green.    Ive got it  he said and pulled a black file off the table. It was a picture of me and a name but not of my family.    You dont need to take this  he said.    No  I repeated holding out a hand.  I ll find you.     Who are you  He asked



The man a tall dark haired man with a thick black beard sat at the front of the line. He was dressed in a black suit and tie which he wore on all fours.    You are the first person I have met who is not an accountant.  he said.  You are also the first person I have met who has been able to do this in person.    I nodded.  That is why I am here.     Good. Why don  t you come with me    He walked over to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. I took it.    I have traveled across the world and I have seen everything that comes with it.    I laughed.  Well good. I want to see what you are up to.    He smiled and waved goodbye. I looked at the map and noticed the number one.      I looked at my watch.  What time is it     It  s five o  clock.     Oh right.  I replied.  Thank you.    The man walked out of the building and I followed him back to the car.  Good luck  he said as we started driving towards the city.

P.P.S. My cat is dead  my girlfriend says as she leaves me alone in the kitchen. I sigh and smile as she enters.  Good night  she says as she sets the glass of water on the counter. She ll have to do. I open the fridge to see if she has any food for me.    What was that  she asks as she grabs the phone from the counter.    A new years eve party  I respond. She nods as she makes her way to the sink and takes out a glass of water. She looks at me as she starts washing her hands but I am too distracted by the phone to notice her face. Her eyes are bloodshot and blue like the last night I had with my best friend. She turns to look at me and smiles. I feel myself begin to fade away into nothingness.    Hello Is anyone there     Yeah I think so. You need to come over.     How long     About an hour or two.     Alright Im going to head over now.    I slowly step back from the sink and she leads me over. We get to the living room where she sits down on the couch. She puts on a beautiful red dress and takes off her shoes.    Hey buddy.     Hi.     Im not a big fan of your name but hey its New Years Eve.    She reaches down and picks up my phone.    Its New Years Eve. Your best friend died in September youve been robbed twice your girl friend is leaving you youve just lost your job and the only one left to talk to is a gay burglar youve got tied up in the kitchen. P.S. Your cat is dead.     Oh... thanks I just needed to know what the hell happened.    

You know what I want to be fit for a king. And you want me to be the most fat man in the world so I can be the most beautiful woman so I can be the most powerful man in the world.        You  re making my day  said the boy his voice cracking with anticipation as he looked down at the floor. His white shirt and black pants were slanted against his body showing only a slight bulge of muscle. He had long brown hair that fell down to his shoulders covering up his muscular frame. A black suit was tucked into his back showing off his muscular body. The boy  s eyes were wide and wild like they were being chased by a tiger.       I want to be the most handsome man in the world. And you want me to be the most beautiful woman So I can be the most powerful man in the world.        And you want me to be the most attractive woman so I can be the most powerful man in the world.        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best        I just want to be the best     I just want to be the best     I just want to be the best     I just want to be the best   

My head hurts  I yelled to myself as I lay on my bed. The pain in my head was immense but I managed to sit up and get the feeling that it was alright for me to be weak. I don  t know why I decided to go to sleep at night. It  s not like I had any other choice. I decided to go to the bathroom so I could get some rest. After going through all the things I could do with a dog I decided to go outside.   The sun was shining brightly and I heard a voice say something about food. I didn  t remember what it said but it sounded like something from a scifi movie. I walked over and looked at the door. The dog was sitting on the front porch of his house. He was curled up against the fence and his tail was pointing at me. I could feel his eyes on me. I tried to run towards him but he was already right there. I didn  t want to leave him alone. I ran to the backyard and went into the kitchen. There was a big bag of dog food lying around. I opened the bag and grabbed it. I put it on my bedside table and sat down. Then I heard a loud noise coming from the living room. It sounded like a dog barking. I turned my head and saw my dog sitting on his hind legs. He was wearing a red and white striped shirt. His fur was a bright pink and his ears were pointed like a cat. He was barking at me and I was scared. I slowly got up and went to the living room. There was a dog on the floor but it wasn  t the one I remembered. It was an older one. It had black fur and it  s mouth was open. It was talking to me. I could hear its voice but I couldn  t make out what it was saying. I thought about trying to stop him but I knew it would never work. So I did what any human

Im not sure why I decided to go with this. I mean I didnt exactly want to go out on the town but I was going to do it. Its all fun and games right      It started off like any other day. My house is really nice so I could afford the gas and electricity and my wife had bought me some nice presents and I had some of the cheapest ones. And when she got home I took out my credit card and paid the bill.      As soon as I came home my wife was crying and her three kids were crying too. She was pretty much sobbing herself to death. I grabbed the kitchen knife and went over to check on them and I saw the news paper headline   Santa Murdered in Santas House       What That doesnt make sense. Santa is supposed to be dead. I thought that was something I should know. I went to the store and bought a box of condoms and they were all empty. I tried talking to my wife about it but nothing seemed to work.      I went back to my house and I found my wife and three kids sitting there crying. I told them I loved them and they all nodded in agreement. I left them alone and they hugged me as I walked away.      The next morning I woke up and saw a picture of Santa Claus lying at the bottom of my bedroom door. I looked at the photo and saw a man standing at the end of the street his arms crossed and a smile on his face. He had a big red hat that was stuck to his head and he had the big black mustache. He was smiling like a big old man and his smile was always big.      I started thinking about what kind of monster would kill Santa. I started thinking about how I would kill Santa if I ever saw him again. I started thinking about how bad

Im a little late to the party but here goes.   I was born in the year . It was a long time ago that I had gotten my first tattoo. The first thing I did was go into the bathroom. When I got out I saw a woman looking at me in the mirror. She looked like she was about to cry. Her hair was all red and her eyes were swollen shut. I decided to take a look around.   In the mirror I saw a man with a beautiful wellkept beard. His face was flawless. His eyes were blue and his hair was white. His skin was white too. He wore a black suit and white shirt. He looked so young. I thought he would be a nice guy.   In the mirror I saw a man with a beautiful wellkept beard. His face was perfect. His eyes were blue and his hair was white.

What do I have for breakfast  I ask my roommate.   He shrugs.  Im not a morning person so I dont know. I just woke up with a headache.     Oh Thats okay I think I ll go grab some breakfast.  I call out.    Of course  he replies  What can I get you    I walk over and take his order. I make sure to leave a note on the fridge  I cant afford to waste any more time getting my groceries. I turn off the lights in the kitchen and head out to the living room.   The only thing I see is my roommates face. His face is scarlet and red with a single tear running down his cheek.   I start to panic. I run to the door and lock it behind me. Ive spent my entire life trying to get into a nice safe but no one has been able to find me.   As I open the door I hear a thud from outside. Its my roommate.    Hey buddy whats going on  he says to me.   I look up at him. My roommate is standing there. He has an intense look about him.    You arent in your normal clothes.  I say as I get up and leave the house.     What  he asks.    Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal Im not normal I 

. million people turn  today and thats just for you.    I dont know whats going on  I said to myself as I walked through the halls of my house. It was my birthday and I was going to be one of the few to know the truth.   I didnt know what it meant but I was sure that I would be known by all. Everyone had a secret everyone knew about it but they werent sure how. What mattered was not whether they knew the truth or not. What mattered was who they knew.   I stepped into the living room where my parents sat. My mother was in a tight embrace with her daughter and she was crying. She looked at me with tears in her eyes. The youngest child of the family was my age and he had a lot to learn. His dad was a lawyer and his mom a doctor. He was also a well respected leader. As I walked past him I noticed something strange. He was staring directly at me.    Are you okay  he asked.    Yeah Im fine. Just...  I stammered out.    I see.    He nodded slowly and then looked up at me.  Did you tell me everything     No but I told you.     What do you mean     I told you that I have some kind of secret.     Oh right. That means youre not alone. You should probably take this opportunity to meet up with someone else.     But I dont want to.    He sighed.  Its just that I am the only person you know about this.     So... let me get this straight. You arent alone     Of course I am.     Well then then why dont you tell me about your secret     Well youve got to be kidding me.     Shut up.  

Whats this  I asked looking around at my hoard of gold and gems. The knight had come in late and wasnt going to stop until I told him about my treasures. He was a tall man maybe a bit overweight and he wore a long beard which grew back to his face with his grey hair cascading down over his shoulders. His armor was also dark blue and he wore a long black cloak which covered his entire body.    Well I think we should leave now.  I said turning to the knight. He stood up and walked out of the cave leaving me alone. I couldnt believe how much gold he had hidden in there. I had never seen so much gold in my life. This was the most impressive treasure I had ever seen and I couldnt imagine it would get any lower. I took a few steps towards the door before I noticed that he was gone and went back inside.    I thought you were dead  I yelled as I started towards the entrance. There was no one else to see me and I didnt want anyone to know. I started walking into the room when I heard a knock at the door.    Who is this  I asked trying to ignore the knock and turn around to find who it was. A figure entered the room carrying a small wooden box.    I dont know  I said staring at the box  But it seems that the princess is in the way.     What are you talking about  he replied  Shes not supposed to be here.     Why dont you go check her out  I said ignoring the knocks.    Of course  he replied  It ll be nice to meet you     Thanks  I said standing up  And Im sure youre ready to meet the rest of the princesses.  

So let me get this straight.    Im pretty sure we all know what that is.   Weve been waiting for years for that moment.   For the US to invade Canada.   And then it came.   A great white goose flew out of nowhere and landed on our doorstep.   We had to fight back with everything we had.   It wasnt a war like any other.   It wasnt a nuclear war.   It was a fucking geese.   Thats what we called it.   In fact there are quite a few geese in the area.   It was almost like a massacre.   A war that was fought over land.   A war that was fought over food.   The geese would fly through the air circling our buildings until they reached the ground level of our house.   They would take everything in their way.   And then they would leave us alone.   We all knew it was a lie.   But thats the way it goes.   I dont think anyone really believed it.   It was a horrible terrible thing.   It was a war that was fought over land.   A war that was fought over food.   It was a war that was fought over water.   But it wasnt a war that was fought over food.   It was a war that was fought over water.   And it wasnt a war that was fought over food.   It was a war that was fought over fire.   It was a war that was fought over ice.   And it wasnt a war that was fought over water.   It was a war that was fought over death.   And it wasnt a war that was fought over life.   It was a war that was fought over death.   And it wasnt a war that was fought over life.   It was a war that was fought over death.   And it wasnt a war that

The night was warm and inviting. The air was crisp and the birds chirped happily in the trees. The moon shone brightly through the clouds. The stars were beautiful and their light filled my eyes. I saw that I had a good story to tell today. My mind was racing as I wrote it.    Im not sure what Im going to write today.  I said aloud. I tried to keep the flow of my story flowing as best I could but I just couldnt manage it anymore. I had to do something. It was time for me to do something.    I think Ive got it.  I said almost as if I knew the words to say them. The paper on which I was writing began to fade away. I started to feel dizzy. I thought about everything. What if there is no way out Did there really have to be any way out Maybe there is some way out I looked up at the sky and saw that the moon was already out the stars still shining bright. There was no point in wasting my time now.    Im sorry.  I said.  I know. I cant let you down.    I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small white book. It was filled with pictures. I put my hand on the cover and read the first few pages. My heart felt heavy. I was afraid.    How did you get here  I asked.    I came home from school and told my mom I wanted to go take a look at the stars. She said she would come back later to see what was wrong.     Oh God. Youre going to die.    I closed my eyes and prayed. I was going to die but I couldnt stop myself. I kept my mouth shut and wrote my last page. I thought about my life and my future and the world around me.    Goodbye.  I said.       Check out rDraxagon for more of

The first time I met him I was in a hotel room in a small town. We had been married for six years and I wanted to spend our lives together but he was just too much of an asshole. And so I asked him to marry me.    Its not fair.  He told me.  Youre the one who has to be alone.     I dont care if you have to be alone.     I know but you dont have to be alone. If youre not happy I can make you happy.     No I cant.  I said.  I want to be with someone who loves me someone who makes me feel like Im a part of something.     Why  He asked.  I want to be with someone who is happy. I want to be with someone who would be happy without me.     Thats why I love you  I said.  Because I am happy without you.     Then youre still happy without me.     Thats true. But I cant just give you away.     I can.     How     Because I love you.     How do you know that     Because I love you.     How do you know that     Because I love you.     What     Because I love you.     So what     Because I love you.     Thats not fair.     No no no...     I can make you happy.     Then youre still happy without me.     Thats true. But I cant just give you away.     Thats true. But I cant just give you away.     Thats true. But I ca

... How was it    I couldnt breathe. My head hurt. My body ached. I couldnt feel anything. I couldnt move.    I guess you didnt have fun with it.     Did what     Youre dead. You can go back to hell. But you cant be reborn.     What     You cant be reborn. You dont exist anymore.     I can still remember that...     Of course I can. Youre the first one to go through this. The others must have gone through this too.     No they didnt. They were just...     I know. They went through this. They didnt want to go back. They wanted to go through this.     But why Why would anyone want to go back     Because its better than living in an afterlife.     I cant go back     You can. Just like you can live in an afterlife. Its better than living in an eternity. You cant go back.     What is going on     Youve been reincarnated. Youre not dead yet. You ll be when you wake up.     I dont understand. Why does it matter     Youre alive. Youre immortal. You ll get to experience the world again.     So I shouldnt go back     Yes. But you wont be reborn either.     Oh that makes sense. But I still dont understand.     There are plenty of ways to go back. You can come back as a baby or as a toddler. Or you can go as a young adult.     A toddler     Yes. You can go back as a young adult. You can choose to go as

I can see  I thought its only a dream.    I looked at the floor and saw a small bed a white sheet and a door on one side and a thin blue sheet covering the other. The room was very dark but I could see through the door.   My name is Michael.    I looked around the room for a moment before deciding to stay here. It seemed like a good idea to stay in my bed and a bit chilly. The cold air felt nice but it made me feel like I was being put into a tub of ice cream by the wind.   I dont remember anything from last night I thought.   My mind went back to the dream but I couldnt quite place where it had come from. My head spun as I tried to recall what had happened.   Im in a hospital room  I said. And Im not wearing a labcoat.    My head started to spin again but this time it stopped.   I am in a hospital room. And I am not wearing a labcoat.    I sat there for a while trying to figure out what had just happened. What had happened to me How did I get here   I am in a hospital room. And I am not wearing a labcoat.    I turned to look at the man standing over me who was clearly in his midthirties. He wore a suit but it was too dark to be his suit.   You are in a labcoat.    I turned to look at him again but he stood in front of me. I hadnt seen him before. He looked familiar but I didnt recognize him.   You are in a labcoat.    His voice was low but it was very similar to my own.   You are in a labcoat.    I blinked trying to focus on the situation.   You are in

The world was never going to know what I had done. I was a part of it but I couldnt help but look back on it all with pity.   I was the best student in my class and most of the teachers werent impressed. There was no way in hell I would have been chosen for this assignment. I thought about my parents and how they looked at me as if I was some sort of monster. The only reason I chose to go into college was because I was smart enough to keep track of the time. It was just easier than being a slave to the system and that meant the work I did was worth more to them than the money. My father would always say that  You can be the smartest person in the world but you cant be the smartest  so he d always say that. I wanted to be a scientist.   I had a lot of friends but they were always a little distant. I didnt like talking to them. They werent exactly like the other kids. They werent even close. I knew they wouldnt listen. I had to do my best though. I needed to get the word out. I had to make sure everyone knew what I was doing. I had to tell them everything.   I sat down and started my presentation.  The sleeper agent was activated at  am on July th  at the time of writing. The operation was conducted by the FBI and there was a large amount of equipment put in place to control him including an extensive training program.    The class was silent. I could hear their reactions from the distance. Some were angry while others were sad. I had to convince them otherwise.    The sleeper agent was trained in a variety of methods and techniques. He was able to identify patterns in peoples minds. Most importantly he was able to identify patterns in the environment and predict their actions. He was very good at his job. He was a very skilled worker and he did not enjoy being around people.    Everyone looked at me with

Im done. I cant stop myself.     Youve got to give up your cause.   And we can rule together.   Okay.   The two of us sit down for a coffee just like everyone else. The door swings open and the two men walk in. They look familiar but I dont recognize them. I know they are.     I have a mission.  My name is Adam and I am the one who killed my brother.     Its not your fault  he says.     It was mine too.     Yeah yeah. It was mine.     I had it.    He stands up from his chair.     We need you to get ready.  I take a sip of my coffee.     It ll be ok.     Dont worry about it.  He leaves leaving me alone.     No.     Ok.     Thank you.  He nods his head as he walks away.     Youre welcome.      Youre welcome.     Youre welcome.

.The people have decided that God should be retired as per his will which was passed down from generation to generation through generations of prophets kings and gods.  .At the age of  the most powerful man in the world was elected President of the United States. This was not a problem for anyone as everyone had their own personal god. It was just a matter of determining who would get the job.  .After the election all gods were given their own roles and roles were decided by an online system. The system was very easy to use since it only required one person to vote and once a year a random person would get chosen as the next God. Once the person voted they would be called to heaven or hell and then they would be reincarnated. This process took about two years and each time the person died they would be reborn in the same place but this time they would live in different parts of the universe.  .God is known as the Universes Creator. He created life on earth and created life on every other planet. He has been a very good God for many centuries now.  .God has created many beautiful creatures and the humans are just too much to handle. Humans are also much smarter than the Gods and they have more knowledge about everything than the Gods.  .As far as the future goes humans are still developing. They still have many great things ahead of them and they still have plenty of time to get to it. However due to the fact that they havent yet found a new God it is still very possible that they may never find a new God. 

st grade my first writing prompt. Please dont hate me   I was a little girl when I was seven and I had a friend who had the ability to speak with the airwaves. He was a very nice guy he would always give me the most hugs which I found kind of weird because he didnt really like me and was kind of shy. I could tell by his smile that he felt safe and knew I was happy. My friends and I were the same age so we would often play tag in the backyard together. It was a good time. We would watch cartoons together and he would talk about everything. I remember one time he even sang to me while we played. I heard him sing  Im sorry  and then I could hear him laugh which was pretty funny. We would laugh until he was tired and then I d go to sleep and then he would come back and we would all be up and laughing. When he woke up he looked at me and smiled and said  Hey buddy Ive been waiting for you . We played tag for hours and he was great and then he started talking about how he missed me and how he missed me. He was really happy that I was here so he went out and took me to the beach where we played. He was so excited and it was so weird and we both were scared. I was a little confused but he reassured me. He told me that he wanted to see me again and that he would never leave me alone. We went to the beach and he hugged me and told me that I was going to be okay and that he would be there to help me and that I would never stop being happy. I loved him so much and he was such a good boy. Then he asked me if I wanted to play tag with him and I said yes. We played tag for hours and he was so happy and I knew he was happy that I was here and that I was going to be okay. I went home and sat on his bed and he was asleep and he was so happy that I was here and that I was going to be okay. After a while we got to playing tag and I

I was just about to finish my novel. I am so excited. I didnt know that it would be the start of my second year at the University. The first semester was great I had my first girlfriend of all time and I can finally have her back.   My life has been amazing. My parents always tell me how much I love them. They are such good people. I think they are right. I love my parents too.   As I am finishing up my book I notice that I am not alone in my room. I am starting to feel a little weirded out. I look around and notice that there is a large door in the middle of my room. It is open with an orange glow coming from the door. It is strange because I never thought I would come here before.   I take a step forward and peer through the door. There is a beautiful girl standing there with a huge smile on her face. She looks at me with a big white smile on her face.    Hello  she says.  I am Jessica. I hope you enjoyed your time here.  She smiled again.   I turn around and find myself staring at this gorgeous girl. She is wearing a red dress with an angelic design on top. She is a beautiful woman. Her hair is flowing down her back like waves. Her eyes are green like crystal and her lips were a deep deep blue. Her skin was brown and almost glowing. She has a long red tail running along her body like a snake. She is wearing a tight black dress with a white lace at the waist. Her hair was a bright red with a pink bun. She looked beautiful in her red dress.    Hi I am Jessica  she says with a happy smile.  I am glad you liked my book I am a pretty girl.  She said.    Oh  I say with a smile.  Thank you for coming Jessica. I hope you enjoyed your time here.    She smiles again and starts to walk away.  Hey Jessica. I am so happy for you. You really make me feel welcome.  She said as

I am the one who has been selected to save the world from the tyrannical dictator of our great nation of course. I was only  years old when he took over the world and declared martial law killing all opposition and forcing everyone to be killed as a result. This is the first time I have ever been brought back from my deathbed in any form not that I could recall being brought back for the final time. The news had been circulating on the internet for days but it never reached me. It seemed so normal like a normal kid getting his Christmas presents and then waking up to find out his parents were gone but for some reason I found myself suddenly and inexplicably transported back in time.        I was brought back from my deathbed at a hospital in which I had been confined for the last year. I was told that the doctor who had treated me was the leader of the resistance. I was asked to follow him around to try and find the leader of the resistance and that he had led them to victory against the dictator. I was left alone with him for a few minutes before he finally asked me what I wanted to do and I simply told him that I wanted to go back and take over the world. He was skeptical and said nothing else.        I had been brought back again to try and end the dictators rule. The dictator had taken over the world and was now trying to conquer the world through force. I was brought back to my room and told that I was to kill the dictator to ensure the freedom of everyone. After my death I would go to the police station where they would arrest me and execute me until they found the dictator dead. After that I would be tried for war crimes against the dictator and sent to prison for a long time.        My parents had died when I was born. The doctor had told me that they were both poisoned by the dictators poison but that it wasnt fatal. They were both shot in the head by the dictators bulletproof car. I didnt believe it

I d always wanted to be an engineer but I never really thought about it. My dad was a great guy and my mom was a great person. She loved me for what I was and everything that had happened in my life. We were good friends and I could always count on her for support whenever she needed it. I guess she didnt want me to grow up alone though.   As I looked out at the vast expanse of space I wondered if this was heaven or hell. I dont know maybe it wasnt maybe it was just another one of those things where you have no idea how you ended up there and then everything is just a blur. I think thats when I started thinking about it. I dont know why Im writing this but I just felt like I deserved it. The first sentence is so beautiful and I feel like Ive been waiting for it all along.   I wish I could go back and change my mind but I cant so I just stay here and let it happen. It ll be okay.

I cant believe it but Im not blind anymore. The computer has become a very useful tool. It allows me to see the world through my eyes and it even allows me to control it. I can do anything I want in the real world. It was just a matter of time before I could see the world in my eyes.    My first mouse was a weird one. It had a little antenna on its back that I figured out by looking at it. I could even turn it off and on and get it to work again. But then when I turned it on and off and on it got stuck with this mouse. I decided to try another.    When I went to look it up online I saw some things about mice that I didnt like. Some people say they were dangerous or something along those lines. But I thought maybe there was something I could do about it.    In the end I decided to use something called a mouse. I tried to make sure it didnt fall asleep but it just kept on going. I would go back to the computer and try again.    This time it kept getting stuck with the same mouse. I tried turning it off and on and it still got stuck with it. So I started trying to figure out what was wrong.
