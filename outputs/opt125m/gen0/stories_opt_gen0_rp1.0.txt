Can I go     Sure dont mind if I do.     I ll take you there.    She walked back her shoulders slumped in her backpack. She could see the butterflies buzzing around the edges of the room the butterflies in the air. She couldnt see them though. She couldnt see them either.

I will not give up my lightsaber Master.     The Jedi Knight stared at the Dark Lord in shock. He was a young man perhaps in his forties or fifties but still had a dark side. The Jedi Knight was the one who had given up his Jedi training to become a Grey Jedi. He had been trained in combat and he had been trained in his ways. He had been trained in the ways of his masters.   The Dark Lord had been in training for over a year. His training was to become the master of the world. He had been training for over a year but had not been able to master his masters methods.   He was tired of fighting the Sith. He was tired of the war that was waged on his side. He was tired of his masters methods.   The Jedi Knight was standing before the Dark Lord with his eyes shut. His head was bowed in a way that showed he was not a Jedi.    I am Master Yoda and I am your apprentice.  Yodas voice was soft and soft and he spoke with a calmness that made the Jedi Knight feel as though he were speaking with a master.  I have come to teach you to be a Jedi and to become a master.    The Jedi Knight looked at Yoda who had been kneeling in front of the Dark Lord. His eyes had begun to darken as he spoke and he began to speak with a tone that made the Jedi Knight feel as though he were speaking with a master.    I have been taught many things and I have been taught many things. But I have not been taught how to master the way that you have.     Master Yoda  Yoda spoke slowly his voice was soft and he spoke with a calmness that made the Jedi Knight feel as though he were speaking with a master.  I am a Jedi and I am your apprentice.    Yodas eyes had begun to darken.  Master Yoda  Yoda spoke slowly his voice was soft and he spoke with a calm

The first time a cure was found it was in the form of a cure for cancer. Scientists have confirmed that the cure for cancer has been discovered on Mars and astronauts have only one chance to bring it home where they hope to duplicate its properties for mass distribution.

The apparition spoke softly to me as if it were a child who had never seen a man in a suit before. The mans smile was too big for a man and his eyes were black as night. He was a man who had seen his share of death but not his own.    I am sorry  he said before disappearing into the night.   I felt a soft touch on my shoulder and I turned to see a young man in a suit. His face was covered in scars but his eyes were dark and dark. His hair was a mess and his face was full of scars.    I am sorry  I said my voice was shaky.  I can not go on like this.    The man smiled and his eyes were empty.    You have only five years left  he said his voice was faint.

The smell of the morning sun was the only thing that brought me out of my reverie. The smell of fresh blood and the taste of fresh meat were both great. It was a good thing that I was here because I had to be in the morning to make the trip. I couldnt wait to get home and find my dog.   I had just gotten home from work and had gotten myself ready for the trip. I hadnt gotten the dog to get up yet but I knew that I could get him to get up if I wanted.   I sat down on the couch and started to prepare for the trip. It was going to be a long trip but it was going to be a long one. I was going to make the trip to my new home but it was going to be a long trip.   I looked down at the dog. It was still asleep but I could feel it moving moving around in the room. I was going to get to it soon and I wanted to go home.   I had a lot of work to do today. The dog had been sleeping on the couch for a long time and I hadnt decided whether I would go through with it. I was going to get the dog to wake up and get ready for work.   I started to go to the kitchen to get some breakfast when I heard a noise. It was my dog.   I ran to investigate. I heard him snore and then a sound I hadnt heard in a while. It was a sound that came from my dog. It was his snore and he wasnt breathing. He was asleep.   I looked over at the kitchen. It was dark and I hadnt seen my dog for a long time. I ran into the living room and saw the dog asleep.   I ran over and picked him up. He wasnt breathing. He wasnt breathing.   I ran back to the kitchen and saw the dog still asleep. I ran back
