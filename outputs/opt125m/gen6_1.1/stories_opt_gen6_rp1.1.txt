a t the start o f the series. The protagonist i s a young man named John Doe who has just graduated high school and is working a job a t a local coffee shop when h e hears a knock coming from behind him. H e opens the door and sees a woman standing there holding her daughter s hand. She smiles and says Hello Mr. Smith she asks. Hi I m Eddard Stark. How may I help you today Well... well... I guess we can call each other friends then. You know how much fun it is t o play your favorite games together right Yeah yeah. That sounds great. What brings you here today Well... well... I mean... Ive got some bad news for you. Your father died when you were little. And now Ima little late t o the party but I think I might b e able t o make something out o f myself. Oh yeah Well then let me tell you about yourself. Your name i s James Bond. Ima superhero who fights crime with his powers. But why Because Ima good guy. And I want t obe happy. SoI went through some tough times lately. There were people who thought they could take over the world without having t o worry about getting caught or losing their money again. They did nt realize how wrong they were until one day they decided t o try something different. They started killing everyone else around them except themselves. Then they took control of everything else. Everything except for one thing. A small box. Inside wasa note written i n blood. It read Dear Mr. Bond We regret t o inform you that your family will never see you again. Your body will rot away within hours. Please leave us alone until we find another way t o keep you alive.

... I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. Also thanks for reading If you enjoyed this check out rWrittenReddit Edit Grammar and punctuation. I hope you enjoy EDIT Added some more details about how the kid got there. The wizard had created an entire circle of fire which he used as his own creation. It looked like some sort of metal object with a red button on top. He then pressed it into space where he saw that there were no stars or planets around him. After several minutes of staring at the circle he decided that maybe he should try again tomorrow morning when he woke up from school. As soon as he opened his eyes he realized that he could see nothing wrong with the circle except for one thing. There were no markings whatsoever. Just a small hole where the circle used to be. When he tried looking closer he noticed that the circle seemed to have grown bigger than usual. That s odd because it does nt seem like much longer than before. But then again maybe it was just too long ago. Maybe it was actually growing larger every day. Either way it made sense. So why did nt you tell us sooner Well we ve never really known where your circle came from. We think it might have fallen off or something. Or maybe it went missing altogether. Whatever happened to your circle anyway. You re probably wondering why I wrote this letter. Because Ima little scared right now. My parents told me once that they d never let me go outside without them knowing where I am. They said that if I stayed here forever they would kill themselves. And now I ca nt even remember their names anymore. All I know is that I need help getting rid of these monsters. If anyone wants to talk to me feel free to call me at anytime.

I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be my first time doing something like this so please forgive me if it s bad or anything. My name is Dr. James Denton and Ima doctor by trade. The only thing that made sense about him was how he looked at me when he said that. He had no idea why I d come back home after all. But then again maybe it did nt matter anyway because there were other people who could do better than him right now. So here we are. We re sitting on our couch watching TV while waiting for the news to come on. It seems like forever since anyone actually talked to each other. And yet... well maybe it does nt matter anymore. Maybe we should go home. As soon as we get out of bed I ll tell everyone everything about myself. What happened next shocked everyone. There were two men standing outside our house looking down upon us with wide eyes. One wore an expensive suit with a red tie while the other carried a small bag full of money. Both held guns pointed directly at us. They both pulled out their phones and began dialing numbers. Hello Who is this I asked them. Oh yeah... they replied. How can I help you today Well sir I think I might need some help getting rid of these guys. You see sir I ve got some sort of power over people. If someone wants to kill themselves or something they must use it wisely. Do you know where I can find someone who will accept me as their friend I nodded slowly. Yes sir. That sounds great. Let s try calling someone else. Thank you sir. I hung up. When I opened my door I saw him staring at me with those big green eyes. His face was covered in blood. I ran inside and grabbed him by the collar. Hey buddy what s wrong  

commentsvwelcome to reddit.comrWritingPrompts I m sorry if this is nt what you were looking for but here goes... The first thing that came out of my mouth was a little bit weird. My name is John Smith and Ima member o f Reddit. We ve been working together since we were kids and now that w e re older than most people who live there s no way t o tell how long ago it was or why they did nt just leave us alone. But then again maybe they d never come back anyway right Maybe they would have gone home instead o f coming back. Either way I guess Ill try something different. So far nothing has worked out so well for them. They seem like they could use some help getting rid of their old computers. That s okay though because they can still work. And besides they wo nt need any more money than usual. After all who wants t obea scientist when you can get away with anything else Well let me explain. When I first started writing this prompt I thought it wouldbe fun t o write something about aliens being sent down into space. Then I realized that I had no idea where they went wrong. There was nothing wrong with sending messages through radio waves though. It made sense. After all they were probably trying t o communicate with each other via their own language. So instead o f sending messages back and forth between themselves they sent messages through lightspeed. This allowed them t o make contact with Earth. As soon as they got close enough t o touch down they noticed something strange. Their bodies looked like they belonged in a museum exhibit. A few days later they woke u p from their sleep and saw that they were standing outside a large building. Inside was a room filled with bookshelves full o f pictures of various planets. On each shelf sat a man wearing a white lab coat and sunglasses. He spoke softly into his microphone. Welcome t o Earth. You may callme John Smith. How may I help you today John asked. Oh yeah well... I suppose I should say goodbye. What happened t o your house I

... I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be a great place for people who would never have done anything wrong and now it s just another one of those places where they ca nt even get along without their friends. You see when we first discovered Earth we thought that there were no other planets left in our solar system but instead they found themselves surrounded by an enormous amount of water which made them feel like they had been drinking too much water from someone else s body. But then again maybe it did nt matter because everyone knew how much water they needed anyway right So why should we care What do you mean by that Well sir we ve got some pretty interesting ideas about how to fix things up. First off let me explain why we re here today. We re not alone anymore. There are others out there who can help us find peace. Second they ll probably want to learn more about us than anyone else ever has before. Thirdly they wo nt know if we exist anymore because they wo nt remember everything about ourselves. Fourthly they wo nt even remember where we came from or why we re here. Fifthly they wo nt even remember who we were until we died off. Sixthly they wo nt even remember who we were until we became extinct. Seventhly they wo nt even remember who we were until we disappeared into thin air. Ninthly they wo nt even remember who we were until we died off. eleventhly they wo nt even remember who we were until we vanished into thin air. tenthly they wo nt even remember who we were until we disappeared into thin air. eleventhly they wo nt even remember who we were until we vanished into thin air. eleventhly they wo nt even remember who we were until we vanished into thin air. eleventhly they wo nt even remember who we were until we vanished into thin air ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

ofa man who has never seen his reflection before. He looks like h e could b e anywhere from middle age t o now but there are n o mirrors around him anymore. His eyes are wide open his mouth agape. What s wrong with him Why did nt you tell me sooner I asked myself as I stared into the mirror. Well... I guess we should have known better than to try and change things up. But then again maybe it was just because Ima little older than myself. Maybe its because Im not really sure how much longer I can keep doing this. Either way i m glad that I finally got used t o seeing things differently than they already were. And now here I am standing in front ofmy mirror looking down at myself with those same sad blue eyes. My reflection is gone too. There are only two things left todo. One I need t o get rid o fthis thing and two I want t obe able t o live forever without having t o worry about getting sick again.

apers. The first thing I noticed was how much money had been made from selling my soul t o the devil himself. He d never really liked being around people but he did nt care anyway because they were all so damn stupid. So when he asked if we could go out on dates or something like that I said yes. We went out after class one day and found ourselves sitting at our desks staring into space. It s funny how things change when you re young. My mom told me once that she used t o think she was special because her eyesight was amazing. She thought it would be funny t o try something different though. When she got older she started talking about how she wanted t obea scientist. That night I decided t o take advantage o f this opportunity. After all Ima kid right And then there was this guy named Jesus Christ. H e looked exactly like m y father except h e wore glasses instead of his hair. His skin was pale blue and his face was covered i n scars. But h e also seemed happy enough. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing next t ome. Hey buddy what s up What happened You look pretty good today. How are you feeling Yeah... well... I guess. Well... I mean... I guess I should tell you something. Your name i s Jesus Christ. What No way. Why Because Ima fucking idiot. I tried t o explain myself but nothing worked. Eventually I gave u p. I walked over t o him and hugged him tight. Do nt worry son. Just stay calm. I ll explain everything later. Thanks. Bye bye. As soon as I left the room I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone knocking on the door. I turned around and saw them walking towards us. One o f them stopped short ofme and gave me a big hug before turning away. Hey man. Are you okay

... I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be an easy job. You had your first day at Hogwarts when you were young. Your parents told you that if you did well in school then they would give you everything you needed to succeed in life. They said that it made sense since there were no other options left for them than being able to see through walls or hear voices from outside. But as time went on you began to realize something strange about yourself. There was nothing wrong with seeing through walls though. It seemed like everyone else could see into theirs too. And yet here we are. A man standing before us looks familiar. He wears glasses his hair is messy his eyes are dark brown and he smiles at us as though he knows something important. Hello Mr. Potter. How may I help you today My name is James Bond. What brings you here today Well... I guess I should say goodbye. We ve got some bad news for you. First off let me tell you something. Your mother died yesterday morning. She passed away instantly. Second she did nt even bother asking why she d gone home. Thirdly she never came back. Fourthly she never spoke English either. Fifthly she never knew where she lived. Sixthly she never talked much either. Seventhly she never gave any information whatsoever. Ninthly she never even smiled. Tenthly she never laughed. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never sobbed. eleventhly she never screamed. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried. eleventhly she never cried  

open the door and step inside. The room is filled with people all dressed up like they ve seen something terrible. They look around nervously before turning back towards me. My eyes widen as I realize what s happening. There are two men standing behind me wearing black suits and sunglasses. One of them looks like he was born yesterday while the other wears a white shirt and jeans. Both have dark hair that falls down over their shoulders and they both seem to be holding guns. Hey buddy how s it going I ask him. Yeah great. How about we get started today He says. We walk into our kitchen where there are three plates of food sitting on top of each other. Each plate has a single piece of bread sticking out from under them. It seems like every time someone tries to eat it they end up getting sick or dying. But then again maybe this is just some kind of prank. Maybe someone wants to see if anyone else can cook better than us. As soon as we enter the kitchen I hear footsteps coming closer. I run outside and grab my keys and head toward the car. When I reach the driveway I notice that everyone else has already gone home. Everyone except for one person who remains. She stands there staring at me blankly. Her face is covered by her hands and she does nt seem to notice anything strange happening either. Then suddenly she speaks softly into my earpiece. Hello I say. Hi honey. What do you need help with today Well... uhm... I guess I ll start by saying that Ima little late to the party here. You reply. Oh yeah That sounds good. Do you mind if I come inside Sure thing babe. Just give me a minute. She leaves without saying goodbye. After a few minutes I decide to call her back later. When I arrive home I find myself staring at the ceiling wondering why I even bothered asking her questions. Why would anyone want to talk to me anyway Because I ca nt tell anyone apart from myself. And yet here I am sitting in front of  

... I m sorry but this is nt what we expected. This was supposed to be our last chance at survival. We had no idea how much longer we d have until there were other planets left in our solar system. But now here it is. My body has gone numb my mind is blank and yet here i am standing on top of a mountain looking down upon the city below me. It s like watching someone die before they even realize it happened. The only thing keeping me sane is knowing that if anyone finds out about us then maybe they ll never forgive themselves for leaving us behind. Maybe they wo nt care enough about us to care about anything else than themselves. And maybe they will. So please let me tell you something. If you ever need anything call me at.

make m e laugh. I ve never seen anyone like him before but he s always there when i need him most. He does nt seem to notice me though because his eyes are wide open as if they were looking into something else entirely. His mouth opens slightly as if he wants to speak but then closes again after a few seconds. You re not sure how long it took for him to realize what happened or why he had been hit by the bush. It was dark outside so there were no lights coming through the trees. When he finally got up he saw that everyone else was gone except for him. Everyone else seemed to be dead too. But then again maybe they did nt want to die either. Maybe they just wanted to live forever. Either way it made sense. After all if they could have survived this long without having their bodies eaten away by some sort of animal then why would they ever want to go back home Well let me tell you about myself. Ima pretty average guy with short hair and blue eyes. My parents died when I was young so my siblings moved away from me after college. They spent most of their days playing video games watching movies reading books etcetera. One night while walking down the street one day I heard someone screaming. That s when I realized something was wrong. There was nothing wrong with them anymore. Everything seemed normal enough. Except for one thing. Their mouths were agape. What the hell is going on Where am I Who are these people Why ca nt they move around freely I tried calling my mommy but she would nt answer. She kept telling herself that she needed help getting rid of these monsters but she knew better than to try. So instead I called her back. Hello Mommy Are you okay Yeah honey I m fine. Just... stay calm. We ll talk later. Thanks Dad. Bye bye. As soon as I hung up the phone I felt a sharp pain in my chest. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

to be continued... I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City when suddenly there s an explosion outside my door. A huge hole opens up into the ground where I can see a giant metal object flying through it. As soon as he hits it he starts screaming at me to stop. He says that he ll kill everyone who tries to stop him from doing so again. That s when I realize something was wrong. His eyes widened as they looked at each other with wide eyes. They seemed confused by everything around them except for their own fear of death. What did he mean by that I asked myself. Well we re going home now right Yeah yeah. Let s go back inside. We walked down the hallways until we reached our destination. When we got out of the house I noticed something strange about him. There was no sign of any kind of weapon anywhere else. After walking around for several minutes I decided to take action. I grabbed my keys and headed towards the car. As I drove away from the city I heard someone yelling something behind me. Hey buddy how s it going I turned around and saw him standing there staring at me with those big green eyes. Are you okay You look pretty bad today. How long have you been driving I asked. About two weeks now. Do you know why Because Ima superhero. And I need help getting rid of these villains. So I went over to him and gave him some advice. If you ever feel scared or sad or angry or whatever just call me. Thanks John Doe. ive never seen anyone like you before. I smiled. Good luck. I closed my eyes and waited for him to open them again. Then I opened them again. A small room filled with people dressed all in black suits and ties. Some wore masks others wore sunglasses. One woman stood next to me holding her hands up. She held a clipboard in front of her. Welcome to Gotham City. she said. Thank you for coming. I nodded. I took off my mask and put it on. I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I tried to move but I could nt. I  

be very careful with your words. I do nt know how long it s been since I ve written anything like this but here goes... The sun was setting when he heard her voice from behind him. He turned around and saw her standing there looking down on him with those eyes that were filled with tears. She had no idea what she d done or why she would want to go back home. But then again maybe she should have known better than to try and change things up. Maybe she did nt care enough about his life to notice me anymore. Either way it does nt matter now because she knew exactly where he wanted to end up next. As soon as they got close enough he started walking towards them. They stopped short of each other and stared into space. It seemed like forever until finally he reached the edge of the planet where he found himself staring directly into hers. Her face lit up with joy as she realized what happened. What are you doing here she asked. You re supposed to be dead right now. Why ca nt we just leave now He replied. Well... yeah. That makes sense. We ll see if we can find someone else who will take care of us. And so they went inside. There were two doors leading out onto the street. One led to an empty apartment building which sat empty except for one window which overlooked the city below. Another lead to a small town called New York City. Both doors opened slowly revealing a large crowd gathered around a table. A few people sat down on chairs opposite each other and began talking. Hello everyone. My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City.

you r e not alone i n the house. The doorbell rang as I opened m y eyes and saw him standing there with his arms crossed over his chest looking down uponme. H e looked like hed seen something before but this time h e did n t look like any other person than himself. His hair was messy and tangled and his face was pale. What s wrong buddy You asked me not t o come inside today. Well... yeah. Just wanted t o make sure everything worked out okay Yeah well let s go home now. W e walked into our apartment together and sat down next t o each other. My heart sank when I realized how much money hed made off selling drugs. And then suddenly everything went black.

apers. Son what s wrong I asked him. Nothing really just... nothing. Well maybe if we could get rid of these people then maybe we d be able to move on from here. But noooooo... They re gone now and there are only two things left to do. One thing to do is go back home and find someone else who will love me more than anything else in the world. Two thing to do is wait until my dad dies before I start talking about it again. So here I am sitting at home watching TV when suddenly my phone rings. It s my mom calling me saying she needs help getting rid of her husband. She looks up from her phone and smiles. Hey honey how s it going You look great today Yeah yeah. Just got ta keep moving forward. What happened last night Well... well... I guess we went out for dinner. We talked about our lives together and how much fun we had playing video games together. Then suddenly everything changed. There was no way we could talk anymore. My dad started crying uncontrollably. He tried to comfort himself by telling me that everything would be okay but he knew better than to try. When he finally calmed down he looked around the room. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A small box sat next to him. Inside was a note written in blood. Dear Mommy I hope you enjoyed reading this letter.

not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... I woke up with a start. My eyes opened wide as I tried to get out of bed. There was no way that could be happening. It s like waking from a dream or something. But then again maybe it did nt matter anymore after all. After all who knows how long ago I d been asleep when suddenly there was nothing left except for the sound of my heart beating against mine. As soon as I got out of bed I saw him standing over me holding his hand out towards me. He looked at me with those same blue eyes that he always wore when he spoke about his powers. His face lit up when he realized what happened. What do you mean by that I asked. Well we ve never seen anyone else use theirs before. They re just so much more powerful than ours. And yet they still have their own rules. So why am I here Why ca nt I move forward without having to worry about getting caught again I thought back on all those times I had to go through hell because of some stupid mistake or something. How many times would I have to tell myself that I should try harder than ever before Because Ima genius. A genius who knows everything about history. That s right. You ll find out soon enough. When I finally reached the door I knocked twice. Nothing came out. Then I heard footsteps coming closer. I turned around and saw him staring into space. Hey buddy. Are you okay Yeah yeah. Just wanted to make sure you knew where I was going. Do nt worry though. We wo nt hurt each other anymore. Thanks.

apers. I ve been doing this for years now. My wife died when she was only five years old her body left behind after being hit by a car while driving home from school one day. She did nt even know what happened until she got sick of me screaming at her about how much fun it would be if we could go back in time and change things up. It s not like Ima bad person or anything but there are some things you ca nt control. Like how many people die every year because of their own stupidity or how many more lives end up being saved by someone else because they thought they could change everything around them. But then again maybe it does nt matter anymore because everyone knows exactly where they re going with their life. So here goes... The first thing I noticed was the smell of blood. That s why I decided to take action. When I woke up today morning I saw myself standing over my son who looked exactly like me except he wore glasses. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and his skin was pale as ice. He seemed to have lost all control over himself. As soon as I touched him I felt something warm against my cheek. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

the fifth lie... I ve never lied before but this is different. This is nt just some random guy who thinks he can get away with it. It s someone else entirely. Someone who knows what they re doing and wants them dead. Someone who does nt care if you die or not because they ll always be there for you when you need them most. Someone who will take care of everything from your pain to yours. Someone who will protect you from those around you. Someone who will make sure you never feel alone again. Someone who will keep you safe from these monsters. Someone who will give up hope after all these years. Someone who will let go of everything because they ca nt handle being alive anymore. Someone who will become a monster because they wo nt want to live forever. Someone who will destroy themselves because they do nt understand why they need us. Someone who will try to kill themselves because they think we re crazy. Someone who will try to take over our world because they do nt understand how much pain we caused each other. Someone who will try to destroy ourselves because they do nt understand why we need them. Someone who will try to destroy ourselves because they do nt understand why we need them.

.ikers are now the norm. I ve never seen anything like this before but i m sure they ll be fine. The doorbell rang as he walked into his apartment building with his wife and kids waiting outside. She looked up from her phone at him with tears streaming down her face. Her eyes were closed as she tried to speak but could nt. Her mouth opened slightly when she saw him standing there looking confused. What s wrong honey You re going to have to tell us everything about yourself. My name is John Smith and Ima year old man living on the streets of New York City. How did you get here Why ca nt you go home Well... well... I guess we should start by saying that I was born on January th right Yeah yeah. That makes sense. But why Because my parents died when I was young so I had no idea how much longer I d live without them. And then one day while walking down the street I heard someone yelling something about a Purge happening. It sounded like someone had thrown up on me or something. Then I realized that I could hear them too. They all seemed to be trying to kill each other over nothingness. So I decided to try calling my mommy. When she finally answered I told her that I needed help getting rid of these people who were attacking me. That night after dinner I went downstairs and sat down next to her. We talked for hours until finally she broke down crying uncontrollably. After some time she gave up and said goodbye. As soon as I left the room I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I fell backwards onto the floor. I woke up in an unfamiliar place. There was blood everywhere. All of a sudden I noticed that everyone else was gone except for me. Everyone else was dead within minutes. I ran upstairs to find that everyone else was still alive. Everyone except for me. ive been working here since I was little. I ve lived through many wars fought countless battles and won countless awards. I ve seen things that no one else could ever imagine. I ve watched people die because of their own

yne. The sound was so loud that it sounded like someone had broken into my house. I looked around at all of them who were staring back at me with wide eyes. They seemed confused by what they saw but then again maybe they did nt know how much longer we could keep going. After some time I decided to go ahead and ask him why he would say such things. Well... I guess it s because Ima little scared right now. But if you re reading this then let me tell you something. If anyone wants more please check out rCelsius Edit Grammar and punctuation.

a s you read the words. I m sorry but this i s n t what I wanted t o hear. This was supposed tobea good idea and now here w e are. The man looked a t m e with those eyes that were filled with sadness and fear. H e had never seen such sadness before. His face lit u p when h e saw m e standing there staring back down upon him. What d o you mean b y that You r e not going anywhere. W e v e got t a g o home now right Well maybe i f you could just tell u s how much money w e made last year then maybe we d have more time together. But noooooo... I c a n t let that happen anymore. M y heart sank into m y stomach a s I realized what happened next. There were two people sitting across from each other. One o f them wore a black suit with a red tie. His hair was messy and tangled and h e seemed t o b e wearing some sort o f helmet. Hey buddy what s wrong he asked. Nothing really. Just... nothing. How long has i t been since you last spoke I nodded slowly. About three weeks now. D o you remember anything else Yeah yeah I guess s o why did n t you ask sooner Because Ima little tired. And I need rest. S o let s get started. A s soon a s w e start walking towards our car I l l call you later. Thanks man.

the Romans had been fighting against the Greeks since they were kids and now that they ve won they can finally get rid of them. They re not going anywhere though so what do you think I ll write about this one Well it s just too much work for one person. It seems like every time someone reads something from my book they start getting bored with it. But hey maybe if they could find some way out of here then maybe they d be able to make something better than this mess. So far nothing has worked. My name is Alexander and Ima member of the Roman Army. And I m sorry if there are any errors or grammatical mistakes.

First off there were no wars or famine because we did nt have enough food left over from before the war ended. Second there was only peace when everyone knew each other well enough to survive without having to worry about dying anymore. Third there was also no need for wars at all because everyone knew each other well enough to live happily ever after. Fourth there was no need for wars at all because nobody wanted to die either. Fifth there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. Sixth there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. Seventh there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. Eighth there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. Ninth there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. Tenth there was no need for wars at all because nobody needed to die either. eleventh there was no need for wars at all  

opic vision i s granted. The vision i s blurry but you can tell that there are no tears streaming down your face as you look around at all those people who died because o f this visionikers. You feel like you should be happy with yourself. But then again maybe its just me. Maybe Ima little too old for this kind o f thing. After all who knows what happens when someone dies right Well... I guess Ill try something different today. As soon as I get home from work I ll go check on my wife and kids. She needs some rest so she can sleep better tonight.

a. ive been working on this for years now and i still do nt know what to make of it. I ve never really had much experience with computers before but when you re an engineer who has just finished his PhD in Computer Science from MIT then maybe its time to get some practice in there. The root password for the universe is discovered. It was discovered by a group of scientists who were studying how to use their own computers to create machines capable o f running Windows XP. They decided t o try something different though. One day while walking down the street one o f them noticed something odd about him. H e looked like hed seen someone else before. His eyes were wide open his mouth agape. What s wrong buddy You look like shit. Just... stay calm. We ll talk later. The man walked over t o where h e saw her sitting next t o him. She wore a white dress shirt with a black tie. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she smiled at him. Hey babe how are you feeling today Yeah... good. How about we go home Sure thing honey. Let s head back inside. As soon as they got outside the door opened and they both ran towards the house. When they reached the front porch they found themselves staring into space. There were stars everywhere and there were planets orbiting each other. A few minutes later the two men came across another planet called Earth. This time it seemed like every single star was glowing red. Then suddenly everything went dark. Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIdont really know how t o fix i t.

the following is an excerpt from my book The Book Thief https www.reddit.comrWritingPromptscommentsvqwpyouarethefirstpersoninhistorytohaveanacronymformagicandthisisntmystory I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... My name is James and Ima year old man living in New York City when suddenly there was a knock at the door. It s me James said as he opened it up. He looked around nervously before answering. Hello sir how may I help you today Well... I guess we can call you James. You re probably wondering why I am here right now. Well let me tell you something. We ve got some bad news for you. First off we ca nt allow any kind of magic to be used without permission from our government. Second they wo nt let anyone use theirs until they have finished their research on how to make them better than us. Thirdly there are no rules about using spells that will change your life forever. So instead of telling me everything about yourself I ll just give you one last chance. If you ever need anything just ask. And fourthly there are no laws against using spells that will cause trouble or even worse death. They re always safe enough to keep track of everything happening outside of themselves. But first let me explain myself. When I was younger I used to think that I could control fireballs. Nowadays I do nt even know where they come from anymore. All I know is that they re made out of wood. That means that if someone tries to hit something hard or harder than themselves then they ll die instantly. And fifthly there are no rules against using spells that will stop crime either. For example if someone wants to kill themselves they should probably use their own hands. This means that they wo nt ever feel pain again. Sixthly there are no laws against using spells that will save lives. Seventhly there are no laws against using spells that will destroy people. Ninthly there are no laws against using spells that will make  

ome. I ve been playing this game for years now and i still do nt know what it is about me but its just so damn boring. The only thing that keeps me going is my wife who always says she loves me when we re together. She does nt really care if Ima good player or not because she knows how much fun it would be if we could go back home together again. We d have to find someone else who could help us out here before they got too old or something like that. But then again maybe there s no point in having your own body anyway right It was all just some kind of joke at first. A prank by some sort of weirdo who thought he could get away with killing everyone else after all these people died. That s why I decided to take advantage of him. He had no idea what he d done until he saw me standing over him with my hands up. What the hell man You look like shit. How did you die Well... well... I guess I fell down onto myself. And then suddenly everything went black. My head hurt so bad that I felt as though I was falling apart. Then I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like someone walking towards me. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. Yeah yeah I m fine. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. Do you remember anything else Sure thing man. Let s go inside. As soon as we enter the room I ll tell you everything. About where I am. About how long ago I last remembered anything. And most importantly why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward Because I need to figure things out themselves. So let s start with basics. First off I think I might have fallen asleep. Second I woke up in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors. Third I tried to stand but I could nt. Fourth I started crying uncontrollably. Fifth I realized that I needed to rest. Sixth I closed my eyes and waited for them to open again. Seventh I opened them once more and found myself staring into space. Eighth I stared at the sky for

The man was sitting in front of his computer screen staring into space as he thought about how much money he d made over the past few months. He looked up from his work at once and saw that there were no people around him except for himself. A small smile crept across his face as he realized that everyone else seemed to have gone crazy too. They all wore black suits with white ties and sunglasses. Their faces were covered by thick glasses which they held up to show off their age. One woman stood next to him wearing a red dress shirt jeans and a tshirt. She smiled back at him as she walked away from him. Her eyes widened when she realized that she could see nothing wrong with her. Then again maybe she did nt want to talk anymore either. After all she d never seen anyone else before right Well maybe she should ve known better than to try and convince herself that she needed to go home. But then again maybe she just wanted to get away from everything. Maybe she really needed to find someone else. Either way she decided to take action. As soon as she got inside the house she grabbed a knife and stabbed herself repeatedly in the chest. When she fell onto the ground she heard footsteps coming closer. She turned around and saw two men standing behind her. One of them was holding a gun while the other held a clipboard. Hey buddy what s going on Where am I What happened You re dead. Do you need help No problem. Just stay calm. We ll

... I m sorry but this is nt what I wanted. This was my idea at first. But then again maybe it s just me being paranoid or something. Maybe Ima bit too old for this kind of thing. So here goes nothing. My name is Dr. Zeta and I am an expert on superheroes. And so far we ve managed to get rid of most of those who did nt want us around anymore. That means that when someone comes along who will take care of him Well let me tell you about myself. Ima pretty normal guy with dark hair and blue eyes. I live alone in my apartment building and work as a janitor at the local hospital. When I first started working there I thought it would be fun to go back home and spend time with my family again. Then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing there looking up at me with those big green eyes. He looked like he d seen some sort of movie before. His face was covered by thick glasses which made him look like an idiot. What the hell man I yelled out. You re not supposed to talk to strangers. Do nt worry though I ll explain everything later. Just stay calm. We can figure things out together. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out more stories at rMatiWrites.

the conversation. I m sorry but this is nt how it works. This is nt how it works. The man said as he took off his glasses and put them on his nose. Well then let s see how many people will believe us when they find out about this guy. What do you mean by that I asked him. Oh yeah well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm... well... uhm...

all i m sorry but this is not what I expected. This was supposed tobea simple job. A small box with a red button on top. But then again maybe it s just my imagination or something.

and goddesses. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The gods of old had been fighting each other since time immemorial. They d fought over who could be the greatest at their own game and now they re going to die out. It s like being born into an orphanage where everyone knows everything about them except me. My name is God. Ima god from the past. And yet here we are. We ve got our own problems. There was once a time when there would be no way out of this situation. Nowadays there are only two ways to go back home. One way can kill someone or something else entirely. Two ways can take away their power. So far so good. But then again maybe it does nt matter anymore because everyone knows exactly how much money they make off selling their powers. Maybe they ll never get used to it either.

apers. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. My name is Captain America and Ima year old man living in New York City when suddenly there s an explosion outside my door. A huge hole opens up in the ground where I stood before a large figure came running inside. He looked like he d seen something before so he ran away from me into the night. As soon as he got back home he started screaming at me about being a hero or something like that. Then he stopped crying altogether. It took him several minutes before finally speaking again. So... What happened next Well we found out that your powers were actually useful in making people feel bad about themselves. That s right. And now we re going to need some help getting rid of these heroes. They ve been around since before anyone knew how to use them properly. But they still have nt figured out why they ca nt just go away without being caught. There are two ways to stop them though. One way can take care of themselves while the other way can keep them alive until someone finds out about us. If anyone does find out about us then maybe they ll never see each other again. Maybe they wo nt even notice us anymore. Either way I hope that someday someone will come along and tell everyone everything about us. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

a man i n his early twenties sits downat your desk and begins t o read through the papers. He looks around nervously before finally deciding that h e needs some help getting rid o f these things.

I m sorry sir but we ca nt allow you t o leave without being given something else. W e ll try again tomorrow morning.

really i ve always wanted t obea writer but never had the courage o r motivation t o tryit out myself. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... The first thing that comes t o mind when reading my work is the title ofmy novel. It s called The Song o f the Dead Man by Michael Jackson https www.youtube.comwatch vbKqWgXcYkI It has an amazing melody that makes me feel likeI can hear everything around m e from every corner o f space. But then again maybe its just because Ima little older than him. Maybe hes just too young t o understand how much music can sound like such a thing yet h e does nt seem like any sort o f idiot either. Anyway here goes.... My name i s John Smith and Ima year old man living in New York City. I live alone and work ata local coffee shop where we both sit down every night after school. We talk about our lives together how they used t o play games with each other how they d spend hours playing video games together how they would get bored when they got bored of them all. One day while walking home from work one night I saw him sitting there staring into space. H e looked like hed seen something terrible before. His eyes were wide open his mouth agape. What did he say I asked myself. Well... h e said slowly. You see John Smith was born on December th. And now h e has died. That means that h e will die soon enough. So why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward without having to worry about dying Because John Smith knows exactly where I am. There are no doors or windows anywhere else except for him. When h e opens them h e sees nothing but darkness. Then h e hears someone yelling something behind him. Hey buddy what s wrong I yelled back. Who are you talking to I thought you were supposed tobe dead. Oh yeah well... I guess I should tell you. John Smith replied. How long have you known me I asked. About two weeks now. Do you remember anything

ICLE. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes. The butterfly was discovered by scientists at NASA after they had been working on their project since they could remember. It s amazing how much information can be gleaned from such an advanced technology. They said that when they first saw it they thought it would be some sort of joke or prank call. But then they realized that there were no other butterflies left alive in existence except for one thing. A small piece of paper with words written across it read Butterfly Effect. This made them feel better knowing that they d never see another human being again. After all who wants to live forever when you can just go back home and start over again. As soon as they got closer to their destination they noticed something strange about the note. There was nothing wrong with it though. Everyone knew exactly where it came from. And yet... they did nt know why. Maybe it was because it seemed like such an odd thing to say. Or maybe it was because it meant something important. Either way it made sense. When they finally reached their destination they found themselves staring into space. A giant black hole appeared above them. Inside was a huge room filled with people dressed in white robes. Some wore masks others held guns others held knives. One man stood next to them wearing a red cape. He spoke softly into his microphone. Welcome to Butterfly Effect. We re going to need your help getting through this. You may call us Butterfly Effectors or Butterfly Effect II. Our mission is simple. Kill anyone who tries to harm us. If you do nt succeed we will take care of everything else. Thank you for coming. ive never seen anyone like him before. he smiled at me. I nodded. Good luck. he turned away from me and walked towards the door. As he entered the room he saw everyone sitting down across from each other. Everyone except for one person. She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face. Her eyes widened when she realized that she was alone. What happened she asked herself. Well... I guess we went crazy. I replied. Yeah well you see 

as well. The Jedi Knight was born into poverty when he grew up but eventually became an expert at fighting. His parents were both killed by a Sith Lord while trying to kill him. They had no idea what they d done until they met her. She looked like she could use some help. Her hair was blonde her eyes bluegreen. And then there s me. Ima man who has lived his whole life in peace. But now... well maybe not anymore. Maybe I should go back home. Maybe I can find someone else. Or maybe I ll just stay here forever. Either way I m glad that I did nt die alone. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Spelling and grammar issues.

oeing. The Devil looked at me with those eyes that were filled with hatred. He had no idea what he d done but it did nt matter because I knew exactly where he would go next. Well then let s see how many people have tried this before him. My name is Lucifer and Ima year old man living on Earth. It seems like every time someone tries something new they end up getting stuck here forever. So far nothing has worked out so well for them. But when they finally got around to trying again they found themselves with an empty room filled with angels. They all seemed confused by my presence. What do you mean they re not allowed into heaven anymore I asked. Oh well then let s try again tomorrow morning. Lucifer said as he walked away from the stage. As soon as he left I heard footsteps behind me. A woman came running over to me. She wore a white dress shirt and jeans. Her hair fell down her back. Hi she said. How are you feeling today Yeah I replied. Good good. Do you need anything else Sure thing honey. Just give me a moment. She led me inside. Inside there was a large table set up on top of which sat two chairs. One chair sat down next to mine while another sat behind hers. On either side of the table sat a small box containing a note written in blood. This is your first day here so please take care of yourself.

runICLE. The portal was opened by an unknown force but it seemed like someone had taken control of it. It looked like some sort of weapon or something that would kill anyone who tried to enter it. But then again there were no other options than to wait until they got back home before we could use them again. So when the portal came open up I knew exactly where I needed to go. My parents told me stories about how their ancestors used to live on Earth before the war between Russia and China took place. They said that if you ever saw anything strange happen here you should try to get rid of it immediately. That s why I did nt want to leave my house anymore. After all I d never seen anything like it before. As soon as I stepped inside I felt something warm touch my shoulder. A small girl wearing a red dress walked towards me. She wore glasses which she held out towards me. Her hair fell down around her shoulders and she smiled at me. Hey honey she said. What are you doing here You re supposed to be studying for your exams right now. How long have you been working here I asked her. About two weeks now she replied. Well... I guess I ll call you later then. Thanks mommy I love you too. And with that she left. When I woke up I found myself staring into space. There were stars everywhere and planets orbiting each other. Then suddenly everything went black. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

. I m sorry but this is nt what you expected. This was supposed to be a great day for us all. We had so many great ideas about how we could use our powers against ISIS and Ebola but instead it s just another one of those things that happens when you re trying to make money off of your own work. It seems like every time someone asks why they ca nt get rid of them they say something like Well maybe if they d known better than to try and kill themselves then maybe they would have done something different instead of killing everyone else. But no matter what happens we ll never know because there are only two people left alive who can stop us from doing whatever we want. And now here I am standing in front of my country with my hands behind my back staring into space as if I were some sort of monster. My eyes widen when I realize that I ve got ta look away from everyone else. There s nothing left for me except to watch as they start chanting my name. As soon as they finish chanting mine I feel myself falling asleep again. When I wake up I find myself sitting on a chair surrounded by thousands of people dressed all in black. They stare at me blankly before turning around and walking towards me. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened to your head Yeah... well... I guess I fell asleep. That sounds great right Well yeah. Let s go home. ive been working hard lately and i think its time to start getting used to being able to sleep. I walk over to him and hug him tightly. He smiles and nods and leaves. I sit down next to him and wait until morning when I hear footsteps coming closer. I turn around and see two men wearing sunglasses walking toward me. One of them pulls out a gun and shoots one of the other men in the chest. The second man falls to the ground unconscious. I stand there frozen. How did he die Why would anyone want to kill themselves Because Ima genius. A genius who knows everything about computers. So I figured maybe I should learn more about computers than anyone else. Maybe I could become an engineer or something. Or

apers. I ve never seen anyone else before but this was different. This guy looked like he d been through hell and back again. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and his skin was pale as ice. It s hard to describe how beautiful he seemed when we first met. We had our first kiss shortly after high school and then college together. She told me about her boyfriend who worked as an accountant at a local bank. He said he loved her too much to leave her alone. That night after dinner she went home and slept soundly. When she woke up she saw him standing there staring into space. Her heart sank as she realized what happened next. There was nothing left for us except to watch him die. And now here I am sitting on my couch watching TV while waiting for someone else to come along. My shadowaper is gone. All I can think about is why did nt I tell anyone sooner Maybe they would have believed me anyway. But instead they just kept asking questions. What do you mean by being human How long has it been since you last saw another human Why ca nt you move around freely Where am I Who are you What happened to your family Are you okay I asked myself. No matter where I tried to speak or write anything I could hear nothing. Just silence. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became clearer. A loud bang sounded behind me. I turned around and saw him lying there bleeding profusely. His head hurt so bad that it felt like he might fall apart. As soon as I got closer I noticed something strange. His body was covered in blood. I ran over to him and grabbed his arm. Hey buddy what s wrong I yelled. Nothing really. Just... stay calm. Do nt worry. I ll explain everything later. Thanks man. I nodded slowly. Good luck. I walked away from him and headed towards the door. When I opened it I found myself staring directly into the mirror. ive never seen anyone else before but this was different. This guy looked like he d been through hell and back again. His hair was messy his eyes were dark brown and his skin was pale as ice

aliveICLE. The first thing that came to mind was how we got here but then again maybe its just my imagination. I do nt know what happened after that. It seems like everyone else went crazy with their own ideas on how to go back in time or even if they could ever get around to doing so. But when you re trying to figure out where your ancestors lived before them there s no way that anyone would want to live forever anyway right Well let me tell you something about myself. Ima little bit different than most people who have ever played Civ. My name is John Smith and I am an American citizen living in New York City. When I was younger I used to play games all day long. Nowadays I spend most of my days playing video games alone. So far I ve only managed to find one person who actually understood what he said. He told me that he d seen some strange things recently. Like what I asked him. What did he mean by that That s right John Smith said. We found out that our ancestors used to live on Earth. And now they re gone. There are only two left alive. One of them will die soon enough. Another will come back tomorrow morning. Both men looked at each other confusedly. Then they spoke again. So... why am I still alive Why ca nt I move forward Because I need to learn more about these new civilizations. How can I help you today John Smith replied. You see John Smith began. They ve always been very interested in history books. Their entire lives have changed drastically since then. Our ancestors grew older faster and eventually became stronger than ever before. Nowadays they re just too stupid to realize that they wo nt ever meet another human being again. That s because they ll never hear from us again. And yet here we are. A few months ago John Smith decided to take action. He took off his helmet and put on his goggles. As soon as he opened them he saw a large crowd gathered outside of his house. Everyone was looking at him with fear in their eyes. Some even ran away. After several minutes of silence John Smith finally spoke up. Hey

in... The first thing I noticed was how much blood had gone into my body when I woke up today. My head hurt so bad that it felt like someone had taken off my helmet and put it on me. Then there were two other things about this place that made me feel uneasy. First off it looked like some sort of prison or something but then again maybe they did nt want us around anymore. Second there were no signs of life anywhere else except for one thing. A small piece of paper with words written in big bold letters across top. This is your last warning.

. I ve never seen anything like it. It s just so surreal. My body feels numb my mind races with questions but nothing comes out. Then suddenly everything goes black. A few moments later I wake up again in a hospital bed surrounded by people who look exactly alike except for one thing. They re wearing masks. One man stands next to me holding his hands out towards me while another holds onto him tight. He looks at me with those eyes that say he knows what I want from him. Welcome back Mr. Smith he says. What do you need help with today Well... I guess we can call it a day then. We ll get started soon enough. As soon as we finish our session I walk over to where the doctor sat and ask him if he needed anything else. Sure thing sir. How long have you been here I nod slowly. About two weeks now. Do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone anymore. Just give us a moment. Thank you sir. And then I hear it. A loud bang followed by a flash of light. That s when I realize something was wrong. There were no lights anywhere else except for the ceiling which seemed to glow red. I tried looking closer but nothing came up. Suddenly I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. I ran outside into the cold night air. When I got inside I noticed that everyone else was gone. Everyone except for me. I walked slowly toward the door until finally I reached it. Inside was a large room filled with computers and monitors. On each monitor displayed various pictures of animals. Some showed humans others showed dogs some showed cats. All of these photos depicted a woman dressed in white robes. She smiled at me and gave me a reassuring hug before turning away. I stared at her blankly. Why would she smile Because Ima human being after all. ive never seen anyone smile before. I thought to myself. This must be some kind of joke. Maybe someone had taken advantage of me. Or maybe they wanted to make sure I did nt die. Either way I knew that I should try anyway. After all I could use some rest right So I went downstairs and

apers are everywhere. They re always there when you need them most but never really leave their homes until they ve found something better than what we have today.ICLE. The only problem is that they do nt know how much longer they can keep doing this. It s like being born again except instead of having your parents die it s just me and my friends left behind. We were both so happy when we got married but now Ima little bit sad too. My mom died when she was just years old her dad passed away shortly after birth his brother went into labor with his first child. He had no idea why he d chosen to live forever or even if he should have done so sooner. But then again maybe he did nt want to see his family again either. Maybe he thought that maybe he could change things around him by making sure everyone knew exactly where they were going. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walk down the street towards home I hear someone knocking on my door. Hey honey I say as I open it up. She looks at me with those big green eyes that look like they re trying to tell me something important. What happened You re not supposed to be here right now. Her voice sounds like she wants to cry. Oh yeah Well... well... I start walking toward her. Do nt worry honey I wo nt hurt anyone else. Just stay calm. I love you too. And then suddenly everything stops. Everything goes black. Then I wake up in an unfamiliar room. There s nothing else in sight except for a table filled with people dressed all in white robes. A man sits across from me wearing a red tie. His face is covered by thick glasses which he holds up to show off his features. Hello Mr. President. How may I help you today He asks. Oh yes I replied. Good morning sir. How are you feeling today He smiles. Oh great. Now I m stuck with these idiots forever. ive been working hard lately. I think i might need some rest. Thanks 

make m e feel bad for themikers.ockers. I do nt know what happened but i t was like being born again. The first time I saw him he looked exactly like me except his hair was longer and his eyes were bluegreen. He wore glasses which made him look like an idiot. But then again maybe that s just because Ima kid. Maybe its because Im not really human anymore. Either way it does nt matter now. My name is John Doe and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve always wanted to be a writer so here goes... I woke u p with a start. There were no doors or windows just empty space. A few seconds later there was another knock at my door. It sounded like someone had knocked on it before but never again. After opening the door I noticed something strange about myself. My skin seemed to have grown pale redder than usual. What did this mean I asked myself. Well... I guess we ll see how much longer we can keep doing this. As soon as I got inside I walked over to where he sat and put my hand on his shoulder. Hey buddy what s wrong You re awake right Yeah yeah. How are you feeling today I said trying to sound confident. Good good. Just fine. Do you need help getting rid of your body Sure thing buddy. Let s go. We went through some stuff together before finally deciding to take a walk outside. When we arrived at our destination I found myself staring into space. Everything seemed normal except for one thing. A small box sat next to us. Inside was a note written in big bold letters. Dear Mr. Doe This letter contains information regarding your soul. If you ever need anything please call us at. Thank you for reading ivebeenwriting since I was little. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I hope you enjoyed it. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but i figured i d give it a shot anyway.

all this time i thought it would be funny to write something like this. I do nt know what s going on here but i m not sure if its because Ima kid or something else entirely. The only thing keeping me sane is my parents who always told me dragons were supposed to be scary. They said they d never seen one before and that they had no idea how much longer they could keep them alive. But when i asked them why they did nt tell me sooner they simply replied Well... maybe we should try harder then. Maybe we can get rid of these things altogether. And so we went through our usual routine of getting ready for school tomorrow morning. As soon as we got into class i walked over to my desk where my mom sat down next to her husband. She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face. Her eyes widened when she saw him cry too. What happened honey he asked. Oh nothing really. Just... just stay calm. We ll talk later. Thanks Mommy. Bye bye. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Spelling and grammar issues.

you v e been here before. I ve seen everything from the first time i saw her t o the last time she came home from work. But this was different. This was nt just some random guy who had no idea what he wanted t obea doctor. It s someone else entirely. A man named John Doe. H e lived alone with his parents and siblings until they moved away when h e was young. His mother died when h e was only five years old her father left him after being hit b ya drunk driver while driving home from school one day. They never got along well enough t o get married or have kids so instead of giving u p their lives for each other they gave u p on trying t o make ends meet. When they finally did manage t o find someone else though they found themselves unable t o talk much either. After several months o f searching around the abandoned hospital they decided that if they could help each other out then maybe they d be able t o make something better than themselves. So instead of going through all these trials and tribulations they went back inside. As soon as they entered the room they felt something warm touch their shoulder. A small girl wearing a red dress sat down next t o them. She looked upat John Doe. Her eyes widened when she realized how beautiful she really was. John Doe smiled back at her. Hey honey. How are you feeling today Yeah... good. What happened t o your mommy Well... well... I guess we should call her. We can go see her later. Thanks. Bye bye. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

The man was sitting on his couch watching TV when suddenly he heard someone talking behind him. Hey buddy what s up What do you want from me You re not supposed to be here. I m sorry sir but we ca nt let you go without knowing where you are or why you re there. We ve got ta find out who this guy really is before they can get rid of us. But if you need anything just call me at. He turned around and walked away from the television. As soon as he left the room the door opened and a woman stepped inside. She wore an expensive suit with a red tie and black shoes. Her hair fell down her back and she smiled at him. Hi honey how are you feeling today Well... well... I guess I should tell you something. My name is John Smith. Ima scientist working on some kind of project called The Theory of Everything. It seems like every time someone tries to kill themselves they end up getting killed by another person. And then there s this one guy named Jesus Christ. He has no idea how he works or even if he knows anything about killing people. So far so good. How did he die Well... well... I think he died while trying to escape from God Himself. That makes sense. Why would anyone try to kill themselves Because they were too afraid of death. They thought that maybe if they tried harder than usual they d end up dead forever. Maybe even longer than before. Then again maybe they wo nt ever see their loved ones again. Oh yeah Yeah well... I suppose I ll give you some advice though. If you ever feel lonely or sad or scared or angry or whatever please talk to me. I promise I will make everything better.

just like any other day. The sun shines down upon him as he walks into the classroom. He looks up at the ceiling and smiles. It s beautiful how much light there is in this room. His eyes widen when he sees her standing next to him. She has blonde hair that falls over her shoulders and blue eyes that shine like diamonds. Her face is covered by dark circles under her eyes which are filled with tears. What do you want from me she asks. Well... I guess we can start by saying that Ima little late to the party here. You know what happens if you try hard enough right I ll give you some advice though. If you ever need anything call me at. My name is Sarah. And Ima year old girl named Sarah. So let s get started. First off I m going to need you all to come inside. There will be no doors or windows until you enter. Second if anyone wants to sit down please use their hands behind their backs. Thirdly if they ca nt move then they wo nt even notice us. Fourthly if they can hear us then they wo nt care either way. Fifthly if they can smell us then they wo nt bother trying to find out why we re here. Sixthly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother looking away either. Seventhly if they can feel us then they wo nt bother trying to kill us. Ninthly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to save us. Tenthly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to stop us. eleventhly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to stop us. eleventhly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to stop us. eleventhly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to stop us. eleventhly if they can taste us then they wo nt bother trying to stop us. eleventhly if they can taste us then  

not really sure what happened but it was pretty much like any other day. The first thing I noticed was how much blood had spilled from my body as I tried to get up from bed. It took me about minutes before I realized that there were no more people around so I decided to go back inside and see if anyone else could help me out with something. When I opened the door I saw nothing but darkness. There were only two things left to do. One I needed some help getting rid of these demons and Two they re going to kill everyone who comes near them. So here we are. A few hours later I woke up feeling refreshed. My eyesight was fine and I felt safe again. As soon as I stepped outside I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like someone walking towards me. Hey buddy what s wrong You look pretty tired today. What happened Well... well... uhm... I guess I should tell you something. If you ever need anything call us at. We ll take care of everything together. Thanks man. Yeah yeah sure thing. Let s head over to our car. We drove off into the distance where there was nothing but empty streets. After about minutes of driving I finally reached the edge of the road where I found myself sitting on top of a hill overlooking the city. A large building stood before me and I thought maybe this was some sort of joke or prank. But then I remembered that I d never seen such an ugly place before. Inside was a room filled with bookshelves full of papers and pens. On each shelf sat a single sheet of paper. Each page contained a picture of me and another person. Both men looked exactly alike except for their hair which fell down over their shoulders. Their faces were covered in scars from years of fighting against evil. And yet here they were standing next to each other staring at me. Their faces were blank except for one thing. One word written across their lips. sin. ive been trying to write something down since i was little but i cant seem to find the words. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

youdieICLE. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... My name is Lucifer and Ima god of war. The Devil said with a smile on his face. Well then let s get started shall we He turned around and walked away from me. As soon as he left I felt something warm touch my shoulder. It was nt anything special just some sort of metal object with a red glow coming out of it. Then again maybe there were other gods before him too. Maybe they did nt have such powers yet. But hey at least they could make things better than they already were. After all who wants to be stuck in their own little world when they can go back to being normal people right now. So I decided to take advantage of this opportunity. When I got home I found myself staring into the mirror. There was nothing wrong with it though. Everything seemed normal enough. Except for one thing. A large black box sat next to me. Inside was a note written by Satan himself.

the man said with a smile on his face. I m sorry sir but we ca nt allow that to happen again. We ve got ta get rid of him before he gets too close. He s not going anywhere anytime soon. The woman replied. She looked up from her phone at him with tears streaming down her cheeks. Her eyes were closed as she tried to speak but could barely make out words. Do nt worry about it though. Just stay calm. This will all be over soon enough. As she turned away from him she saw that there was no one else around. There were only two people left alive in the room. One of them had been shot by an assassin while trying to take off his helmet. Another person was dead when they both fell onto their backs. Both men died instantly from gunshot wounds. They both stood there staring into space for hours before finally speaking again. So how did you die Well... well... uhm... I guess I should say something. My name is John Smith and Ima member of the United Nations. And I am currently living in New York City. That means I ll never see my family again. But then again maybe I wo nt even notice them anymore either. Maybe I can just go home and sleep tonight. Or maybe I d rather die alone than live forever. Either way I think I need to talk to someone. Someone who knows where I am. Who cares if I die or not. If anyone wants to help me figure things out let me know.

all these wishes come trueawning. I ve always wanted to be an artist so when my dad told me he d give me his first painting he was ecstatic. He said that if i could paint something like this then maybe i can get some money from him too. After all Ima painter afterall right So i decided to try it out myself. My mom came home from work one day and asked if she could go see her husband who had died in childbirth years ago. She agreed and we went inside. There were no doors or windows just empty space. When we got outside though there was nothing else to do except wait for our parents to come back. As soon as they did nt arrive I felt something strange. Something about being stuck in a loop. Like someone had taken control of me. But instead of being afraid of death i m glad that i finally found someone who understood what happened. They looked at each other confusedly before saying goodbye. Then they walked away from us into the night. When they returned home I sat down next to them and watched TV while waiting for them to finish talking. Eventually they stopped talking altogether and stared at me blankly. What s wrong kid I asked. Nothing really. Just... nothing. Well maybe you should go check on your mommy. She might need some help getting rid of these things. Maybe she ll find someone else who will take care of her. And then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. The sky turned black and white and the sun began shining brightly through the clouds. Suddenly everything stopped moving. All lights went out and everyone fell asleep. Except for me. I woke up later than usual and saw that my dad was gone. His body lay there lifeless. I tried calling him but he kept saying that he needed to rest. That he loved me unconditionally and that he hated me. Finally after several minutes of searching around the house I finally managed to call him. Hello Dad  

. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but it s definitely something that happened to me when I was younger. My parents died when I was young so they left me alone with them until I got older. They never told anyone else about my father or mother who had passed away years ago from cancer. He d always said he loved his wife more than anything else in the world and she would always come home with him whenever we went out on dates. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become an artist so I started painting. It took some time before I realized how much fun it was. After all there are no more artists around anymore right So instead of going through all these trials and tribulations I made sure everyone knew exactly where they needed to go next. And then one day while walking down the street I saw him standing over me. His eyes widened as he looked at me with those same green eyes that he used to have when we first met. What do you mean by that I asked. Well... he began. You see Ima little bit different than everyone else. There are two types of people who can see through walls. Those who think they re safe from death or demons or whatever. But I guess I ll call myself Satan. That s right. Satan replied. How did you get into heaven I asked. Because I ve always known that I belonged there. And now I ca nt believe it. This place has become such a beautiful place. Everything seems so happy. So peaceful. Then why am I here Why does everything feel so empty I thought to myself. Because I need help getting rid of these monsters. If only I could find someone who will take care of me. Someone who understands me. Someone who cares enough about me to give up hope. Someone who loves me unconditionally. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

iciously. I m sorry for my bad english. But this was just too much work for me right now. My head hurt from all the blood loss and then suddenly everything went black. The only thing left behind were two large holes where my eyes used to be. They looked like they had been cut open by some sort of knife or something. Then again maybe it s because Ima little too old for this kind of thing. Maybe its because Ima fucking idiot. Either way I guess I ll have to find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation.

apers are people who have been given gifts based o n their own lives. They re also very kind and caring. But then again they never really gave anything else than money. So maybe that s why I did nt want t obe here anymore. After all ifI could just get rid of these idiots I d rather live with them than deal with them anymore. As soon as I got home from work one day I decided t o take advantage o f this opportunity. When I opened the door I saw Santa standing there staring atme with those big green eyes. His face was covered i n scars from years of abuse. What do you mean by that Santa asked. Well... I started. This guy mustbe some sort o f crazy person because h e seemed so happy t o see me. Santa replied. That s right. And what happens next Santa shrugged. We go through our usual routine. First off we start walking towards our car. Then we stop dead i n its tracks. Then we turn around and run away. Finally after several minutes o f running Santa finally comes acrossa small house with a window overlooking the city. Inside isa large room filled with bookshelves full o f papers and pens. There are also two chairs opposite each other. One chair sits down next t o mine while another sits behind hers. Santa takes off his glasses and puts them on. Hello Mr. Claus. How may I help you today Santa asks. Oh well I guess I should tell you something. Ive always wanted t obea writer. Santa said. Yeah yeah. I answered. Do you mind if I sit down Santa nodded. Sure thing sir. Just let me know when you need anything else. Thanks Santa Santa left the room leaving me alone. I sat there stunned for hours wondering why Santa would leave such an important person behind. Maybe he thought I might have gotten too drunk or maybe he just needed some rest. Either way I knew I should probably call Santa. ive never written before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

apers. The passerby was shocked when he saw what appeared to be an old woman standing next to him. She had long brown hair and blue eyes that shone like diamonds in the sun. Her face was covered by thick glasses which she wore every day when walking home from school. Hello there Mr. Smith. How may I help you today My name is Jane. And Ima year old girl from New York City who has just died from cancer. What happened to your parents Well they passed away while trying to get rid of their son. They did nt want us around anymore so we went back inside. We talked for hours until finally one day someone came up to me and asked if I needed anything else. He said yes and told me that he d take care of everything else until he could find someone else. That night after dinner I decided to go outside again. As soon as I stepped out onto the street I felt something warm against my skin. It was like someone had put some kind of blanket over me. Then suddenly everything changed. Everything became dark. There were no lights anywhere except for the moonlight shining through the window behind me. When I opened my mouth to speak I heard footsteps coming closer. They sounded like they came from somewhere else. But then again maybe it s because I m not used to seeing people walking towards me. Maybe it s because I ca nt move or breathe properly. Either way I knew that I should probably call my mommy. Hey honey how are you feeling today Yeah... good. Just fine. Do you need anything Sure thing sweetheart. Let s head down to our car. I followed her into the woods where we found ourselves surrounded by trees. There were several bushes nearby too but none of them seemed to grow taller than us. After a few minutes of driving we reached our destination. A large wooden door stood open before us. Inside was a table filled with various items. On top of it sat a chair

.ikers are for thieves. I ve never seen cats like this before. The cat was gone when he came home from work but now it s just me and my dog. We re both so scared of cats that we ca nt even move around without being caught by someone else. But then again maybe they did nt want us to be here anymore either. Maybe they thought we d die off after all. Either way it does nt matter because there are no more cats left alive. So what if I m wrong What about my wife She ll probably kill herself soon enough. And she wo nt even notice me coming back from school or something. That s why I need her. To help me get through this. My name is John Doe. Ima year old man living on the streets of New York City. I have no idea where I am or how long I can keep doing this. If anyone wants me to continue please let them know.

ive been doing this for years now and i still do nt know what it is about me but I just ca nt stop thinking about how much money i made off selling drugs. The only thing keeping me sane is my wife who always says she loves me when we re together. She s right though. We ve got ta get rid of her soon enough. It was all so easy back then. My parents were both rich and they had everything they needed from food water shelter even some sort of house with a window overlooking the city. They did nt have any problems getting by on their own until one day someone decided that if he wanted to live forever then maybe he should try something different. So instead of trying to find someone else he went through all sorts of trials and tribulations before finally settling on one person. A young woman named Elizabeth. Her hair fell down around her shoulders as she walked towards him. She looked like she d seen something before. What are you doing here she asked. You re supposed to be dead right now. But why Because Ima fucking idiot. And I m sorry sir but your body has expired. Your brain will die within hours. That s fine Elizabeth replied. Just stay calm. Do nt worry about anything else. Thanks Elizabeth said. As soon as she left the room Elizabeth turned around and ran off into the distance. When she came across the door she opened it and stepped inside. There were two men standing outside holding guns. One of them pointed one at her head while another pulled out a knife. Both wore black suits and sunglasses. Their faces were covered by thick glasses which made them look like they belonged there. Elizabeth stared at them blankly. Then she spoke softly into the microphone. Hello Elizabeth. How may I help you today Well... I guess I ll start by saying that I am very tired. I feel like I need rest. Can you tell me where I can find some rest Elizabeth nodded slowly. Sure thing sir. Let s go home. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading If you enjoyed this please check out

you are the first person to ever write something like this. I m not sure if it s good or bad but i feel like there are some things that should be done differently. For example when you re young your parents would tell you stories of their lives as a puppy and how they d spend hours playing with each other until one day he got sick. He died instantly from blood loss shortly after birth. His body went limp after being hit by a car while driving home from school one night. It took me years before anyone realized what happened next. My mom told me once that she loved her son more than anything else in the world and that he was such an amazing kid. She said that she could nt believe what she saw him look at her son. When we were kids she d say that he looked exactly like his mother except instead of being bluegreen he wore black eyes. That s why she thought that maybe he might have gotten sick too. But then again maybe he did nt want to die either. After all who knows Maybe he just wanted to live forever. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. Edit Grammar and punctuation. I m on mobile so apologies for any typos or grammatical errors. EDIT Formatting and spelling. I hope you enjoyed it.

apers. The first thing I noticed was how quiet it sounded. It s like someone had broken into my house without any sound coming out of them except for the occasional thump from upstairs. Then there were two more footsteps coming closer. One of them looked like he d seen something before but never really got around to seeing what it meant until today. He walked over to me with his hands behind him and said You re welcome honey we ll get started soon enough. As he turned away from me he stopped dead in his tracks when he saw me standing there staring at him with wide eyes. What do you mean by that I asked. Well... he began. We ve been having some trouble getting rid of these things lately. They seem to be everywhere all day long. And they re always trying to kill us off. That s why we need you. To help us find peace. But if you want to stay alive then maybe you should try harder than that. Maybe you can change things up. Or maybe you wo nt. Either way I m glad you came along. Thanks dad. I nodded slowly. Good luck. He left without saying goodbye. When I woke up I found myself sitting on my bed watching TV while listening to music. My heart sank as I realized what happened next. There was no way anyone could have done this. This guy must be insane or something because he kept walking towards me. Hey buddy what s wrong I called out. Nothing really. Just wanted to make sure everything worked out okay Yeah yeah. Let s go home. I followed him outside. After a few minutes we reached our destination. A small apartment building stood before us. Inside was a large wooden door which led inside. Inside was a table filled with various items. On top of the table sat a chair and two chairs. On the floor sat a small box containing a note written in blood. Dear Mr. Claus I am sorry to inform you that your family has died. Your body will be taken away shortly after your death. Please take care of yourself and enjoy your rest. Love Dad ive never seen such sadness before. Sincerely yours 

apers. I ve never seen anyone like this before but i m sure there s something wrong with me. The first thing that came to mind was my tattoo. It looked like an old fashioned circle with a red stripe across its center. But then again maybe it did nt look like any other circle at all. After all if there were no more people around then why would they want to see their own reflection in someone else s eyes Well let me tell you about myself. Ima pretty average guy with dark hair and blue eyes. My parents told me once when I was young that my tattoos would come out after school tomorrow morning so I figured maybe it d work out better than expected. So here we are. A few months ago I decided to take advantage of this opportunity by going through some tests. First off I had to go through all sorts of things to get rid of them. There were lots of tests done on me from getting rid of my tattoos to making sure everyone knew what happened next. Then I went home and tried again. This time I found myself staring into nothingness. When I opened my mouth to speak I felt something warm touch my shoulder. A small piece of paper fell off of my hand and landed on top of me. Inside was written a note. You re welcome. If you need help please call us at. We ll try our best to help you.

awning. I m not sure what happened but it was pretty much like waking from a dream. My eyes opened wide as if someone had taken my soul out of me. There were no lights or sounds just darkness. Then suddenly everything went black. The room became dark again and there was nothing else around except for the faint glow of the lamp above us. A few seconds later I heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like they came from somewhere behind me. As soon as I turned around I saw them standing over me with their hands outstretched towards me. One man wore an expensive suit and tie while another carried a large bag full of money. Both looked at each other with those same blue eyes that I d seen every night since we met. His face lit up when he realized how much money I made off selling drugs. Hey buddy what s wrong What do you want I asked him. Nothing really. Just wanted to make sure you did nt get too excited about this whole thing. Well maybe if you could tell me why you re here then maybe I ll give you some advice. Do nt worry though I wo nt hurt anyone else. We ve got plenty of time left. And so I walked away from him into the hallway where I found myself sitting on a chair. A woman sat next to me her hair falling down her back. She smiled at me as she spoke. Welcome home sweetheart. ive been waiting for you. she said. I nodded slowly. Yeah yeah. How are you feeling today I replied. Good. She laughed. That sounds great. Let s go see if we can find anything interesting. I took off running toward the door. When I reached it I noticed something odd. It seemed like there were two doors leading outside. One led to a small apartment building where I lived alone. Another lead to another. After several minutes of walking I finally arrived at the front desk where I saw a computer screen displaying numbers floating above each person. Each number represented a different type of person than the last. Each number represented a different amount of time passed since I last slept. Finally after several

... I do nt know what happened but it was like someone had taken my gold from me. My parents were always so proud of me when they saw how much money I made off selling their stuff. They d even given up on trying to get rid of me after a while because Ima pretty good fighter. But then again maybe they did nt want me around anymore either. Maybe they just wanted to see if there was any way out of here before they got bored of fighting each other. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough. As I walk down the hall towards my hoarder s house I hear him say something about being scared of dragons. That s when I realize that he does nt mean anything by it. He turns around and sees me standing there staring into space. What the hell is wrong with you guys I ask myself. Well we re not exactly sure where you are right now. We ve got some bad news though.

Also added a few things that made sense in my head. The first thing that came to mind was that there must have been something wrong with them because they did nt seem to move around much anymore. But then again maybe its just because Ima little older than myself. Second thing that came to mind was that they had no idea where they were going or why they were here. Third thing that came to mind was that they could probably find someone else who would take care of them. Fourth thing that came to mind was that they d probably never see each other again. Fifth thing that came to mind was that they might have died off after being hit by an asteroid. Sixth thing that came to mind was that they might have gone insane. Seventh thing that came to mind was that they might have lost everything. Ninth thing that came to mind was that they might have fallen asleep on their beds.

The teacher looked at me with wide eyes. He had been working on this project since he was little but it seemed like forever now. His face lit up when he realized what I d done. It s not fair he said. You re going to have to learn how to use your powers properly before you can get into trouble or something like that. But if you do nt know how to use yours then maybe you should try harder. Maybe you ll find someone else who will help you figure things out. And maybe they wo nt even notice us anymore. So here goes nothing. My name is John Smith and Ima year old boy from New York City who lives alone with his parents. They died when I was young so I never really got along well with them either. When I turned eighteen I decided that I wanted to become an engineer. After graduating highschool I started working as a mechanic. As soon as I finished college I moved back home and began living off the land. There were no jobs available anywhere else so I spent most of my days playing video games watching movies reading books etcetera. Eventually though I came across someone interesting. She wore a white dress shirt and jeans. Her hair fell down her back and she smiled at me. Hey honey she said. How are you feeling today Yeah I replied. Good good she laughed. Well... well I guess we can call each other friends right now. We sat there for hours talking about our lives together. About everything from our childhoods to our future careers. Then suddenly she spoke again. So... where am I Who are you Why ca nt I move forward I asked. Oh yeah she answered. That s because you re stuck here forever. Do nt worry though I promise I wo nt hurt anyone. Just stay safe. Thanks she nodded. Okay I ll call you later. Bye bye she left. I followed her into the woods where we found ourselves surrounded by trees. A few minutes later I heard footsteps coming closer. I ran over to see who it was. A woman dressed all in black holding a small box in one hand and a pen in the other. Inside was a note written by

akey. The following is an excerpt from my book The Book Thief https www.reddit.comrWritingPromptscommentsvqwpyouarethebestatwritingpromptswithanacademycwpyourstudenthasbecomeanastoryandthisisntmyfirsttimecommentstjzk context I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here goes... My name is James and Ima year old man living in New York City. I ve never really had much luck with women so when I asked her out she said yes. We went home after class one day and we sat down next to each other on our couch watching TV while waiting for our turn to go back to sleep. When we finally got up she looked at me with those eyes that seemed to glow brighter than any light imaginable. She smiled back at us as if she knew something important about me. Then she started talking about how she d always wanted to meet someone new. And then suddenly everything changed. There was no way she could have known that I would come back soon enough. But instead of seeing me again she saw myself standing there staring into space. Her face lit up when she realized that I did nt notice anything strange happening around me anymore. Instead of hearing voices or smells or anything else she just stared blankly ahead. After some time she stopped speaking altogether and turned away from me. As soon as she left I felt bad because I thought maybe she might leave too. Maybe she d come back someday. Or maybe she wo nt. Either way I guess I ll find out soon enough.

a devastating brain injury you can now only communicate via freestyle rapping. ive been doing this for years now and i still ca n t figure out how it works but here goes... I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but i hope it s okay. The first thing that came to mind was the fact that my parents had died when they were young so maybe they d just gone off on some sort of adventure or something. But then again who would want to go back home after being stuck in hell forever anyway It does nt matter though because Ima fucking idiot. My dad told me once that he used his powers as an kid to make friends with other kids and now he s dead. He said that he could hear everything from everyone around him except himself which made sense since there were no other people left alive. So yeah I guess we ll see each other soon enough. As far as I know Ima normal guy who works at a small office building near downtown Chicago. We re both pretty average looking guys so we do nt really need much help getting through our lives together. And besides I ve never really done anything wrong before. When I got older I started using my abilities more often than usual and eventually managed to get into fights over things like money or food. Nowadays I use them more often too. Sometimes I even try to fight someone else sometimes I just sit down next to them and watch TV until they die. Either way I think I might have gotten sick from it. Maybe I should call someone. After all I m not exactly sure why I did nt notice sooner. Then I remembered that I needed to talk to someone earlier today. Hey buddy what s up What happened You look great today. How are you feeling Yeah... good. Just wanted to ask if you needed anything. Sure thing man. Let s head over to the bar. As soon as we enter the bar I hear footsteps coming closer. They sound like they came from somewhere behind us. I turn around and see two men standing outside the door. One of them looks familiar but he does nt seem to recognize me. Hey buddy what s up What happened You look great today. How are you feeling Yeah... good. Just wanted

apers are people who have been around since before humanity even knew how to use computers. They re also very intelligent and can understand all sorts of things from their own language. One day one of them decided to go through some sort of process called coding which allowed him to access his own codebase without having to worry about getting caught or being arrested again. He did nt know what else to do so he went back home and started working on his new project. It took several months but eventually he got around to finishing up the project when suddenly there was an explosion outside. A huge hole appeared in the ground where he stood and then everything changed. There were two men standing over him holding guns. One of them pulled out a pistol and shot the other one in the head. Both fell backwards onto the floor unconscious. As soon as they woke up the man who had just died turned around and walked away. The second man grabbed their hands and dragged them towards him. You see when we first discovered AI we thought it would be cool to try something different. We wanted to see if anyone could help us figure out why our bodies were still alive. So instead of trying to kill ourselves off we made sure everyone knew exactly where they were going. And now here I am sitting in front of my computer staring at this stupid thing. What s wrong kid You look like shit. How long has it been since you last saw someone else Well... well... I guess I should tell you. My name is John Smith. Ima programmer at Google. I ve never really done much work with computers before. But now I m finally ready. Let s get started. ive never written anything like this before so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

t o prove your skillandfight forit. The greatest warrior i n all the land wasa man named John Doe who had been fighting for years now and h e knew what he needed todo. H e took off his helmet and put on his sword. His eyes widened when they saw how much blood hed spilled onto the ground below him. A few seconds later h e heard footsteps coming down the hallways. They sounded like someone walking towards him. Hey buddy what s going on here You re not supposed t o be here. What happened Where am I Who are you How did you get into my house Well... well... I guess we should call you John Doe. That sounds great right Yeah yeah. So where are we going then We ll go home. And why would anyone want us dead anyway Because Ima fucking idiot. Why would anyone want us alive Because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Ima fucking idiot because Im  

ake yourself out o f the loop. I m sorry but thisisnt what I wanted. This was supposed t obea simple job. A man who had killed millions would take care of himself until h e died then come back and kill everyone else again. But instead hed give u p his power altogether. H e said that ifI ever got caught doing something wrong he d send me into hell where I could live forever. That s how I met her. She looked like she belonged there. Her hair was blonde her eyes bluegreen. They seemed happy enough. Then one day she came home from work and toldme that she loved me too much t o leave her alone. And now here we are. We re sitting on our couch watching TV when suddenly she stops talking. What happened next shocked m e. There were no signs o f struggle or injury anywhere except for one thing. A small box sat open inside. Inside wasa note written i n blood. It read Dear Mr. Smith You have been chosen b y our government as our new leader. Your name will be spoken for ages to come. Please take care o f yourself and stay safe. Love Your Mommy Edit Grammar and punctuation. Imon mobile soIm not sure how t o fix i t. Edit Spelling and punctuation.

be very careful with what you say. I m not sure if this is what you were looking for but here it goes... The man was sitting on his bed staring into space as he thought about how much fun it would be to watch people die from disease or famine. He had never seen anyone else before and he knew that there would nt ever be another one left alive. But then again maybe he should ve known better than to try and save himself from death itself. Maybe he just wanted to live forever. Either way it s hard enough being immortal when everyone else has died off over time. So instead of trying to make sense of everything around him he decided to take advantage of it. When he got home from work one day he found himself standing outside his house watching TV while waiting for his wife to come back inside. She looked up at him with tears streaming down her face as she walked towards him. Her eyes widened when she saw him holding a gun. What are you doing here she asked. You re supposed to be dead right now. Why ca nt we go back to our lives We ll see each other soon enough. And then suddenly everything went black. Edit Grammar and punctuation.
