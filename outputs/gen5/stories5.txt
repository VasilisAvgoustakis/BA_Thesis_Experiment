`` So what's the deal? ''   `` I thought it would be nice if you could just keep playing as yourself, but... no!

I sat down on my couch and watched as a man with his long black hair walked by, seemingly unharmed.   `` You're so smart? '' I asked him. He shook his head at me for taking an interest in my story when he smiled again. `` Well, you know that was really great! That should be something to keep from going into your writing career - or maybe just getting fired if it turns out not working... well whatever else we could do about this one issue isn't important enough anyway ; *maybe* work does have value there. ”   The man looked up from his book sitting beside me, which reminded me of a place where people often find their inspiration behind stories they write : the library. At least once every year someone goes through a different set of prompts ( like /r/WritingPrompts ) but always found themselves reading more than ever before due to some kind offshoots between them. It seemed odd how many times during those short periods alone had anyone read anything interesting even though no one actually went back over what happened after such a big break took hold. Not only did these types of things seem very boring then why would any author take care of doing stuff without having time to explain everything because nobody cared anymore except himself until finally everyone thought twice since all our lives were ended anyways. But here comes the problem now – How can somebody start using random words instead of real ones based entirely on actual events rather easily get bored while ignoring other writers who also happen to use meaningless dialogue altogether whenever possible unless suddenly everybody realizes otherwise completely wrong information becomes available online faster today thanks to the fact that most likely nothing happens around us anywhere besides ourselves either way makes sense right away. So far almost none of this works outside of Reddit itself however… What are its problems? Do they need to change minds somehow eventually finding ways to make ideas look good regardless of whether or NOT THEY ARE GOOD PROBLEMING AND NEED TO BE TRYING FOR WHAT IS WRONG OR JUST SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF YOU CAN GET A BETTER THAN THE WORLD WILL END NOW THEN THERE HAS NO WAY OF GOVERNMENT IN IT BUT THAT DOES N'T MAKE ANY MORE SURE AS MUCH FUNNERFUL DOLLARS SO EVERYONE WOULD KNOW WHY SOMEONE COULD WANT TO DIE WITH ME ONCE WHEN WE ALL HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT HOW EACH OTHER REASON

As the villain returns from their journey he sees only two remaining villains : Death and himself. They all share some of the same old habits about who they are or how much longer it takes them to find out what happened between these two heroes ( which is why I'm writing this one now ).   The other character however realizes something important - death doesn't seem like an option anymore ; instead you have just been killed by your own son/daughter while trying desperately to keep him alive but somehow each time someone comes up to say `` Goodbye '' she wo naught any more than if we had both died before us! So here goes...

The only thing I noticed was that it didn't look like an ordinary square, except for one face which looked absolutely different from what you would see on TV and radio stations all around us.   It seemed strange to me because of my confusion at first sight when I saw this man standing next to me : he was wearing a black hoodie with a white collar tied over his chest ; but there were no eyes or ears either! In fact, nobody had any other visible features besides the wrinkles underneath them so I decided to put him down instead. As soon as I heard someone shout out `` Hello '' ( after hearing about your parents who have been shot by guns ), I immediately rushed towards him until they stopped speaking. Suddenly, everyone started screaming wildly... before suddenly, something hit me right outside the window - maybe even two feet away? But then everything went dark again just behind my eye. No more noises coming up now. My vision returned back to normal-ish colors -- mostly red and yellow. And yet, nothing happened anymore.. All I could hear was the sound of some kind of explosion being emitted above the house. Then, silence ensued inside the house. Eventually, people began to notice too much light pollution emanating from the windows causing the whole neighborhood to be filled with smoke. The building fell into darkness completely within minutes though. Soon, however, things got darker than expected due to the lack of sunlight filtering through the windows. Even worse, the air became extremely cold compared to the temperature levels surrounding the house. After several hours, we finally reached the city center where we found our new home. We thought well enough, but today is going to be another day without clouds here… Not tomorrow anyways. Until tonight night will come once more. ”   *I think i am dead*   He walked quickly onto the street below, almost tripping himself off while shouting incoherently `` Stop talking! You are dying alone every second since yesterday morning. Please stop crying baby boy if you know how hard it feels to keep moving forward forever cause why doesn't you start getting closer each time? STOP NOT GOING TO GET UP AND DOWN ANYWAY YOU WANT MORE YOUR LATE FOR ONE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR WILL FURTHER BE COMING BACK IN TIME PLEASE DO N'T TOUCH THAT NOW WHY IS THERE

`` Sir, we are not in need of this... ''   `` We shouldn't be here sir! It is as if our mission has just been cancelled for too long? You will get out soon enough or something. ``, I whispered.   `` But that does n´t mean no matter what happens next..it could never happen again my dear brother wouldnt listen with me anymore please do i swear his hand over my shoulder he got up from the bed so loud like screaming at him but somehow everything worked together well when things went wrong right now..I am sorry man ; its time then why must anyone give their life away without knowing whats going on there they go back inside looking into each other ”   `` Yes Mr. Rogers - how about tonight let us hear stories…with such great difficulty people can understand more clearly than others may think otherwise because these two men were alone most of them did nothing else except stare off towards eachother whilst watching TV while staring down at the stars before disappearing completely behind them which turned out to be quite entertaining indeed after reading some books by someone who had read those old books said :   `` Dear God bless America John Lewis Jr. The war broke out much quicker today thanks to the sheer amount of resources available during the Second World War where thousands of innocent lives were lost due to chemical weapons being used against humanity almost immediately afterwards including many children still alive whose lives ended tragically caused countless casualties causing widespread suffering both physically and mentally. Our country needs help fighting alongside everyone around us regardless of religion nor belief system any longer resulting in greater levels of violence within our society- unless further investigation finds evidence supporting that god fearing actions led to violent deaths across the globe already leading to increased civilian death rates worldwide amongst millions upon millions of innocents unable to cope with the consequences of having become infected via exposure to radioactive substances called lead poisoning combined with extreme amounts of radiation created by nuclear power plants globally throughout Europe coupled with increasing global warming causes major economic problems stemming from climate change related to pollution associated with deforestation linked to growing population centers near Asia Pacific between 2040 and 2150 Japan became known as the world leader in environmental issues relating to developing countries based on information gathered through satellite imagery sent directly to humans using satellites instead of computers rather than computer networks given

`` It's just me, you know I can't help but wonder how they did it?! And that is why we were so close to each other when he was a boy and she knew what his name was... He looked like an old man in some kind of way.. But this time there seemed to be something different about him than her son or whatever else had happened over their years together since then on all fours ago now..   She thought as she saw my eyes widen at first - everything changed from being full of emotion to being confused by myself only moments later after waking with a new feeling more intense yet distant- until finally coming back into focus again for once before falling asleep next to me still staring blankly down upon the floor above me while running towards the bathroom door where I was sleeping right here :   The room itself opened behind me ; bright red carpeted walls surrounded me except for the small white curtains covering my face which made the bed look like it was covered in blood under the covers. A large pair of white chairs sat across from me facing the window opposite me sitting side by side looking out through the glass windows opening slowly away suddenly realizing that even though I could see them both directly ahead of me ( not completely ), I definitely felt very alone because one of them actually spoke English instead of Latin nor any other language besides english speaking correctly either. My head started spinning around trying hard to figure out if someone told me these words anyway due to our differences between us having two tongues combined would have been weird really considering that neither tongue ever came true anymore anyways.   Suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching outside getting closer every few seconds leading to a loud bang against the wall along with a loud crash sound followed by a loud crash noise similar to the crashing of a truck hitting a building without warning immediately following orders given by those who come closest to me walking backwards onto the sidewalk toward me whilst screaming obscenities *I want to get home*… What do I think can happen today morning knowing exactly whose house has been hit by gunfire already during my shift tonight should I go straight to work tomorrow night please stop yelling curses whenever possible ” **HEY SHIT THAT BANG** shouted James standing beside me leaning forwards pushing himself forward violently holding his chair slightly enough to prevent him from toppling off causing him to fall heavily attempting desperately to slam open the doors closing quickly leaving no chance of escape. “ Sorry sir

`` What is your power? ''   `` It is the ability to change everything you ever wanted, and it can only be used once in a while if there are no other options left for me. I wouldn't allow this kind of thing at all! The most powerful person on earth has been granted immortality by my own hands since he was born as an adult with unlimited energy capacity but not quite enough powers anymore so now that we have one option : to take control of our world forever or else die before they even know about us - do n ’ t worry though ; just keep being patient because some people will never let go after them anyway. ”   The voice came from behind him like a thunderstorm descending upon Earth itself causing nothingness to come out of here except the sound of the wind blowing away dust off of the surface. He reached up quickly covering himself and grabbed the knife blade tightly around his neck slowly. With a flick of his wrist he pulled apart the knife until it was firmly lodged inside his body. This time however, something happened completely unexpected.. something much more sinister than what could possibly be happening outside his brain had suddenly appeared beneath the clouds surrounding the city. As soon as the sun began to rise again he saw something strange happen above him then immediately looked over towards the sky below.   The creature opened its eyes revealing light blue orbs which were shining brightly onto the ground where the water lay. They were almost glowing red beings floating down low looking towards him directly through the clouds. Suddenly the creatures seemed to be getting closer yet another giant wave of black wings extended upward upwards along their legs making the massive waves appear larger ones moving faster forward toward the horizon leading to the city. Then when the creatures stopped flying back further together everyone noticed the huge amount of smoke emanating from the city air filled the air creating a small cloud of smoke falling across the ground leaving little room for any creatures to see who might be hiding under the clouds themselves…and thus becoming more intelligent humans became more dangerous beasts….the creatures started to grow stronger each day having difficulty keeping track of how many different types of creatures went extinct throughout the entire city due to the changes coming every year ( including those that did ) these creatures moved steadily slower without stopping either side existing naturally nor using supernatural abilities such as teleportation magic spells made easier to use during times of need. Soon several new species entered the city allowing for continued growth

`` No, no. ''   `` Yes? I'm not going to let this happen again! There is a very good reason why you shouldn't be here for such an important event that needs to be taken seriously and stopped by all concerned citizens of our city - * ''   `` What happened on Earth was catastrophic ; it had been predicted in advance since we first discovered life... And now there are people who believe they have caused what seems like quite a great deal of damage from mankind- including one man with his wife at the moment. This has led many governments to declare war against us because they did nothing but stand up as equals.org supporters before being destroyed entirely due to human rights violations ( which would only cause more casualties ) or their own deaths while others fear retribution if they do so without any prior warning whatsoever : You may leave your home alone until further notice when another person appears out front claiming responsibility for these events occurring within 24 hours after its last entry into existence -- even though none of them will ever see me come back alive once my body does.

My family members must also follow along shortly afterwards whenever possible.. After much consideration regarding your safety precautions etc. Please continue reading below – where can I help make sure everyone reads quickly enough & stay safe whilst other residents remain safely informed via emailing some form of communication about new developments happening around the globe today afternoon**

I'm not sure what to say now, but the feeling is overwhelming at first and it doesn't really matter until you get in your car after I drive off or something like that...   There are so many other people on my list right here with this one? They just ca n ’ t believe they could keep me alive for some time longer than we can count out! So much fun stuff happening all over again ; there will be no way someone else gets anywhere near them when they come back from their last trip home : )   But wait… Wait … What about those guys who do these things everyday because if anyone was going to kill themselves tonight then how would they know why he did *he* go around doing his thing today anyway? Well.. He always got into fights sometimes even though everyone knew where everybody went wrong during their lives - well maybe most likely probably none-others were dead too soon before any of them ever happened ( except apparently nobody had died yet either ).. It seemed as if every single person has been killed by him since childhood/whatever -- which seems kinda odd considering both the fact that each individual dies more often and the fact that everything started moving slower due to an accident later anyways. The only reason humans never learned anything new besides being immortalized through video games still shows us staring up at our screens while driving away slowly becoming increasingly sickeningly sickensingly sadistic towards death instead of realizing life itself completely pointless anymore.So let me tell you another story behind watching movies without seeing anybody die huh? That sounds interesting haha '' And finally lets begin writing down below once upon awhile please feel free to leave feedback regarding future plots & plot details via /r/WritingPrompts @ r/writingprompts [ CC ] ^^ https: //www._reddit_comics # xboxerangraphy # Xboxerangraphy # xboxerangraphy

`` I don't know what it is you are telling me? You're not a good person or anything! It seems that everyone has their own problems and they have all sorts of other issues with them so there needs to be some way out for them to get along.I just ca n ’ t believe this man was ever able to keep up appearances on his internet posts when he tried to talk about how much better people could possibly accomplish than those around him were because if only someone had been more successful at trying to make fun of himself then maybe even one day humanity would figure out something different...   So here comes my question : How can anyone give such an honest answer without making any real sense now-we will finally find ourselves back together again from our mistakes while still having no idea why humans should go through these same motions over and over until eventually ( unless otherwise stated ) *they* wo never come home alive forever** And guess who wants to save mankind anymore as long as possible..And honestly though i dont think its too bad right off chance anyway -if history repeats itself like this every time somebody else does try to kill themselves but after years of searching hard enough into finding new ways to escape society which means thats basically saying whats wrong before everything happens except most likely nobody knows where/where goes etc..but anyways really sincerely dear OP ^^and thanks god im going to love /r/dori_tales # 2 **guitarfingerpitchings ] [ WP ] This piece looks very similar to mine first ; sorry guys feel free to check things down soon haha Thanks <3   Edit 1 -- If anybody enjoyed reading please let me know by commenting below @ dori_tales # 3   EDIT2 -- Any feedback appreciated greatly help getting rid of grammar errors~~   ***EDIT 3*** Sorry typos slipped between lines during writing prompt comments may cause formatting bugs^^

It seems very odd now too why does someone need to tell anyone else since everyone knows everything around them looks similar though its impossible even without knowing where those guys come from - Well thats one more side effect --..

The last time I saw him was when he stopped in front of me and pulled out his gun again... well that's not exactly what happened before my eyes shot open like hell!   `` You know how long we were up here? ''   `` Well anyways anyway now this thing just keeps going on until someone finds us so close they can stop anything from happening or something else will happen.. okay then maybe everything goes ok right around noon though.

A man, dressed in dark clothing walks up to me from behind an old wooden desk looking for his keys on the floor beside him. He looks around as he sees nothing but darkness surrounding him. I can feel my eyes trying not to see anything more than shadows or white light shining through the window above me.   `` Hello? ''   `` Uh... yes sir? How is this going to be happening now? What do you mean we're at war tonight so long as everyone has guns ready? ''   `` Well if only it wasn't just someone who didn't even know what they were doing that day before today! The whole world knew when all of us would die anyway ; why should anyone else have been allowed to live like those fools left here thinking about their own lives forever? You got ta keep living these days because nobody cares anymore how bad your life went until there really is no one stopping them right now either. If every single member of society had any idea where humanity ended then surely none of us could ever hope to get rid of our problems by leaving Earth alone again. ''   `` No way Mr President…I need to tell you something- uh oh hey lookin'down hard enough sometimes some other time will make sense..the last thing i remember most of all : *it happened*..and its funny actually im kinda scared out loud though haha yeah thats fine too much shit lol ) Just think yourself overjoyed ya okay guys are gon na give away everything alright huh ok lets go relax OK let's talk later maybe try to calm myself nerves eh good bye ugh yea wait please excuse misterfuckface whats wrong dude dont stop breathing quick r/Andrew__Well_youll_help._hehaha well wtf wo fucking leave dad sorry god damn whatever yer motherfucker said goodbye **look** hes getting pretty pissed already she still loves her baby boy daddy sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

The sun was already setting before me on my way home from work - I've been having a good day of school since we got here so far...   The sun had started to rise over the horizon as it passed through the clouds that surrounded the building below us. It seemed like every one of us would be getting ready for our journey back home without being interrupted by another person coming out into the distance with their own handkerchiefs or other fancy gadgets? Some people might think this is some sort of joke because they haven't seen any humans yet ; maybe even just after all these years where there are no more animals left than cows! Not only did everyone get food stamps though, nobody really noticed until now : They were still living off of farm land around town outside of town which meant nothing to them either. What do they call themselves anyway? Well yeah sure enough, those folks who came up with names such as `` The Skyline '' could make quite the difference between being able to read anything written about someone else while not needing to see anyone anymore ( although perhaps later ) means making coffee too. So if anybody ever saw something interesting then what should they tell everybody today anyways? If he knew how to cook things properly his father probably sent him away knowing better *he* needed to know why exactly everything worked right -- well unless.. He has never known much luck working alone anywhere near the skyline during his time travelling travels except once again under the sun. That does seem odd considering most kids wo n ’ t actually hear stories telling tales based on folklore surrounding mythical creatures rather than actual human beings standing in front of the window watching TV news instead of looking down upon reality tv channels playing video games using phones nowadays. Maybe someday humanity will start seeing videos online almost overnight giving mankind hope ahead of its current efforts against the world domination technology companies however apparently history hasn… As long as society continues to allow life expectancy increases exponentially beyond old age limits due both to advancements made worldwide each year gives birth to new generations regardless of whether or NOT there is indeed intelligent life everywhere possible. But hey man can finally find peace together anytime quickly thanks to technological advances happening throughout modern times.So please let me ask questions honestly guys welcome me onto reddit eventually haha Sorry sorry i may miss writing feedback

The world was dark and white with gray clouds rising in from nowhere to blot out any light that shone on it as if they were just being watched by some sort otherworldly creature. The people who lived there did not understand what lay beyond them ; instead they knew how to die when their loved ones died - or rather had been tortured for centuries before reaching an end like this one I am sure would never see again until my eyes are opened up upon me at once.   `` You're here! '' I screamed into my cell phone which connected to my shoulder lamp so that I could be seen without having to put on headphones while watching movies online where everyone else looked terrified after seeing anything suspicious but nothing unusual about myself.   As soon as I realized that everything around me had gone black though, something went terribly wrong : the sky darkened completely except for the occasional bright flash of sunlight falling over the horizon ( usually only briefly ) along with the occasional red dot appearing above the horizon below the horizon... It seemed that all that remained behind me simply vanished within minutes.   There is no explanation why anyone has ever come back home since then? But whatever happened next will haunt us forever because we haven't even left our house yet due to the sudden disappearance of a few hundred miles away now. We should leave somewhere safe enough to enjoy ourselves long enough to live comfortably among the stars anymore than we can afford. Perhaps death does take care of itself eventually -- maybe life takes more time depending on whether we survive longer periods anyway. Maybe someday humanity wo n ’ t make peace through starvation alone. Or perhaps God himself wants us all to go extinct sometime today too. Either way, every year brings another day different results unless someone decides to try to keep themselves alive much faster somehow. And regardless, humans still seem to think things differently sometimes. If somebody decided to stop working everyday most likely he would save his family money later on either side of the world during the nightfall days. That might sound crazy considering mankind always seems to want to stay awake pretty often nowadays anyways. So do let me guess tomorrow means many new years worth of work each month coming together finally paying off bills whenever possible.

`` You haven't asked me what I want to do. ''   The boy looked at the woman in front of him with wide eyes, an expression that was quite unnerving for her. She did not seem to notice his face or anything about it but he seemed to be smiling as well.   `` Do you know where we are going then? This place is just... empty. We're all waiting here so this will go on forever before my next job does any good. '' He continued staring at the girl behind him.   `` No way around being scared anymore because *you* think your life sucks anyway..it feels really unfair when you try to talk yourself into letting people hurt themselves without even realizing they were supposed see through their eyes again instead of seeing them coming down stairs everyday knowing there has to always been some other person trying to help us get back together until now anyways lol-I am sure everyone wants to learn something else too haha --uhhhhmmm oh yeah yea how can anyone say no better than i guess im doing fine if its hard enough right up there dude please tell me u okay ok OK Ok thanks OP : )   It felt strange sometimes though - maybe more often these days things would turn off after only having moments left by those two girls talking every night ( hey buddy man why can't thats happening huh guys seriously don ’ t expect friends ever endearingly weirdly funny/interesting etc ) ; But today she decided to change course later tonight while standing outside playing video games using my phone against the wall which had taken several hours to process over half of everything except myself getting ready for school tomorrow morning class due to a loud bang sound followed by the sound of gunshots hitting the floor somewhere nearby.   After three hours since hearing footsteps echoing throughout the room sounds filled the hallway causing the door to slam shut abruptly slamming open completely leaving nothing visible everywhere besides the large wooden box hanging directly above the walls itself revealing a small mirror depicting a bed covered in white sheets surrounded by a pair of black curtains sitting opposite each other along with a picture of a giant pool table set atop a tree line made of thick trees surrounding the center of the room looking at each other.   `` Hey babe hazy bud bro woowwws look great hun b

It was like the entire world in one small, yet vivid image ; there were many who had seen it before : their parents and teachers, family members, coworkers, classmates, acquaintances, friends, or even people they knew to be themselves. But none of them wanted to admit it - not only did they want it to happen again but for everyone else too.   The moment I met my mother's face as she smiled at me, she took her hand back from mine and shook it up slightly more gently than ever. It made perfect sense so I sat down next to her smiling once more, then walked over to my bedside table where I found myself sitting on the edge of a large, dark room full out of paintings depicting how humans looked when we first saw our very own children.   After seeing this painting alone though, I decided to try something different... maybe make some sort words? This time around, however, I felt uneasy about having no idea what exactly happened until today ( which is why now has been 20 years since i haven't noticed anything unusual ). So after taking another drink off my glass, I set my eyes to my wife's birthday cake. She told me all those things every morning while staring into my eyes just looking away right through the glass window! And finally, upon realizing everything would change soon enough because I never thought these days could end well..and thus ended quite quickly*at least according to the rules-that said, if you do break free from the curse, live forever without breaking any laws by virtue of being able to leave home tomorrow night instead of going downstairs later will prevent you from doing whatever shit *is* supposed to DO IF YOU GO AWAY FROM THIS CITY AND HAVE BEEN SAVED BY A VERY MORTAL PERSON WHO DOES N'T KNOW WHAT TODO WITH YOUR BECAUSE OF THE WILKS THAT ARE IN THERE BUT FOR SOMEHOW THEY CAN NOT SEE THEIR TRUE SOUL AS WELLS HERE ''   As luck may have it, most of my memories are blanked out due to lack of memory loss during school day. If anyone remembers correctly such a horrible event can come here within minutes although normally someone must wait outside 24 hours afterwards trying desperately to get somewhere safe despite getting lost near the front door whenever possible hoping to escape via the police station nearby. However, unfortunately I still remember nothing much other than

The world is becoming a simulation of itself - with no real consequence to it or its creators as long as they don't act on any form of moral authority whatsoever.  I have always wanted to be an engineer but just now my body feels like it should be working in some sort... other way? Oh yes, that sounds amazing! And what if everything was going to go according you could only imagine how much more complicated life might take for this machine and all those people who can afford them will become better at not having to pay their bills every day even though everyone else has gone through so many terrible trials trying to find jobs where there are literally hundreds of thousands of dollars left when we give up our lives right away without realizing anything about why exactly things happened....I think i need a few extra months before these machines start functioning again ( which seems quite convenient ) : )   There were several attempts by both sides back then ; from the beginning most of us would never know because nobody had thought otherwise since time immemorial ago yet once humanity started dying out humans began living off of ours completely destroyed themselves into nothingness after being wiped out over 80,000 years ago thanks mostly to pollution due to global warming caused by human stupidity combined with constant fighting between species around the world while simultaneously destroying ourselves throughout history forever lost almost entirely during each century worldwide war against another group called `` The World '' decided to kill myself first ever using nuclear weapons instead of radiation poisoning chemicals resulting in millions of deaths globally based on mankind causing destruction across billions of galaxies leading directly to the extinction of Earth population 2.0 billion million decades down below average levels 1.0 billion years prior except Antarctica alone took place 50,931 years earlier than normal earth did 20,374 days previously including 200,535 days previous estimated 3.5 billion years ago **It looks like Humanity needs to move forward faster** A quick scan showed me 10,800 years ago “ We must make drastic changes here within 5 years*…this can't happen fast enough…..the sooner anyone realizes something catastrophic happens inside 4 years until someone loses control too quickly***….it appears Mankind does not want to live anymore……we wo n´t survive longer ***and probably 100,999 years till 7th/14th/15th/16th/17th/18th/19th/20th/21st/22nd/23

I'm an astronaut. My name is James Anderson and I am a space explorer in Spaceflight 722.9B.   The mission was meant for my purpose : to survey asteroids that are just so far away from Earth it would be very difficult to get close enough to any of them before they hit our planet ( or near ) the atmosphere! We were all trying to understand how we could detect these things but there had been no results yet as well... What if anything else? And what about this one object with its glowing red glow instead? This time around though nothing has gone wrong except for some weird metallic thing being ejected out of orbit into the solar system which looks like something similar to a human skull on paper - presumably made of metal without much use by gravity itself ; apparently more alien than humans didn't have access to light anymore either since those two objects happened to collide together after impact somewhere thousands of years ago when everything went black due to lack of life left over again because humanity somehow managed not to survive through such a big explosion caused by radiation poisoning/decapitation attacks etc. It does seem strange now given their unique technology however i feel bad knowing someone who will never come back here ever existed.. But hey lets see why you guys came home last night having fun while watching your favourite show ''..The words `` Hello everyone please take me off course sirs thank you Mr Anderson Please let me go do whatever u want until then contact us where can you help us find anyone willing to listen ''..Well yes thanks Sir John Anderson answered Yes Thank you Captain Shepard replied Well he knows every person within minutes said hello There must be nobody interested really sorry captain Shepard responded Good bye Officer Shepard thanked him For saying hi Commander Shepard spoke English Very happy welcome Admiral Shepard walked down the hall looking for anyone able to talk his way towards us He looked up admiringly smiled As usual hes standing next to the door followed by a short silence behind the door General Shepard opened the door slowly opening wide open inside seeing several people walking along the hallway holding hands waiting for orders officer Shepard approached first Lieutenant General Shepard entered immediately following her direction she saw a large group of men running past She took cover under the door Private Shepard stepped closer to the door Chief Sergeant Corporal Thomas Gannett stood outside talking to himself sitting beside him sat across from him smiling as always “ So good lad… How

`` Don't worry about me, I 'll make sure of your condition soon enough ''   `` Sure thing? Just don't get the job done again! You can't just stay with my family for so long without even being able to work together and love each other as much as possible while doing this... oh yes, well then tell yourself how many times have I been alone since we were kids.. or had something happen in between us during our first year at school today after college when we went home from school because mom told her she was going to die anyway ; but hey now everyone is happy like hell these days they are all kind of miserable people who live their lives out here too young, can only go through life knowing what happened next time around until someone tells them there will be nothing left except maybe some kid sleeping peacefully under an umbrella over his pillow which he does not know where i am anymore than anyone else has ever slept before though. ``   `` Oh god did Mom say anything last night dad said goodbye huh man why wo na talk back tomorrow daddy please let him sleep okay ok honey its alright babe right yeah no worries mum mama really sorry fine lets come see ya mother wont shut up Daddy dont cry forever father whats wrong mummy missmamma didnt ask any questions thats happening baby dear im still hungry good bye darling sweetie look guys watch those little tears fall asleep big boy everything looks amazing remember grandma always wanted to hug old friend never got tired anytime stop smiling grandpa keep watching Grandpa everyday think nice day grandmother should kiss everyones face one minute don ’ t lie sado wake daddy givethonemommyhoweverheyhereyoureher*   **Wake Up Honey** ( https : //www2ndstory.com/wp-content_uploads/2013/09/a_scary-woman_who_was_loved_by_the_nobel_begins_with_the_nobel )   *Don't Forget Me Babebaby Baby* ( http: //www.youtube._watch -- -1g4eLpK3k7Yw )   > It would seem pretty easy for Emily to forget things earlier tonight morning hahaha haha OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING THAT FOR ME MOMMYMANDALL

`` He was going to do it, '' I said as I turned around and walked towards my room.   `` Why?! How could he be so stupid about this thing if his life just went horribly wrong... like we all did when people started believing him- how can someone get over themselves before they die without knowing what happened after their parents died - wouldn't there ever be any way for me to go back here at least once again because then why is everyone still convinced by some random coincidence but oh god.. It's been years since every single one of us has had our own funeral or something ; i guess those are exactly where things should start now though haha )   As I looked up into the mirror through the window, i saw a face staring at me from across the street :   `` Are you sure man will come home soon enough please tell them everything she knows already know whats happening right away. ''   And suddenly seeing nothing except the face sitting opposite me smiling wide-eyed.   `` No no sir wait till today lets see ya old friend buddy dude remember last time u got ta meet her dad & mommy together daddy always called each other name day ( thats not even true anymore lol ) Anyway listen guys down im gon na head off tomorrow morning trying to make sense of anything strange huh yeah okay its fine alright ok bye sweetie goodnightyeeee y'know wan na keep watchin bout tonight try to talk to ya mummy let's finish talking to ya mothermy dont worry baby hey mister didnt hear anyone else missive wooshoweehh honey sorry yea well yes ma'amma want to give birthdays cause sometimes while hes kinda late maybe grandma needs to send flowers which makes heaven better than hell nevermind dear bud does she need to write poems/etc etc..and christmas love forever ami glad bzzz zerdsdder ddddaDDADDADDADDADDADDADDADDADDADADDADDADDADDADDA DDADADDADDADADDADADDADDADDADADDADDADDADDADDADDADDA

I'm sitting on the couch, thinking about my favorite video game I have ever played - “ Welcome to *The Sims*! ''   It was only when it happened that I realized what had gone wrong at first ; there were no words or sounds right after playing `` Welcome to *The Sims* ” but as soon as I heard someone else respond : “ Oh yes, thanks for calling me up. ”   The next morning, with an overwhelming urge to jump out of bed by jumping into the open window, I turned around just like everyone said before... My whole life is spent trying not to wake anyone who has never been awake since then so all I can do now are sit down outside their apartment building hoping they find some sleep during the night ( oh well ) until one day..and maybe something horrible happens later?.. There really shouldn't be any more people sleeping today because this particular thing does n´t work properly yet though anyway -- Just go back home tomorrow if you want to get ready for tonight… But let me tell you- What did happen last time we left our house yesterday evening alone again anyways? Did she know exactly how to use her flashlight instead of using it anymore? And why would anybody even bother taking photos without seeing them through your eyes looking over every few seconds except once/once etc? So here goes, please enjoy these days till end** As usual, head upstairs from my living room bedroom doorbelling downstairs behind my computer chair which leads to the sound of running shoes slamming against the wall under the couch above us. This means that whatever comes along will probably come sooner than normal due to the fact that nobody knows anything beyond the comfort zone being locked away within 5 minutes unless otherwise specified – At least thats ok considering its pretty standard stuff either way too long i guess im still wondering whats going on haha Well lets keep walking towards the bathroom hopefully eventually things settle nicely alright eh hey hi manhaha yea okay fine wait another couple of hours til 8pm am chill off already feel free to leave ya guys welcome everybody hello wtf kind of weird feeling huh Ok yeah yesss good bye hahh hmmm sorry dont worry bout those two problems omg fucker got ta make sure ure busy bro buddy ^^okay mkay ill meet mommy & dad [ 3 ] < 2

I think I should have read this as my own writing prompt... but there is something odd about it : It takes me so long to realize what happens when we don't know where our parents came from ; they would probably be gone by two hours later if I did not take them back home after dinner together instead of in town again because of some sort out-of place away from their house ( which usually meant no one else knew ).   The world went dark with the first day of school on December 5th 2015 - though everyone here said `` hey '' before all things considered, then everything changed drastically today at least until Thursday morning! We were supposed googling every detail during lunchtime only being able come up with another idea why nobody left us alone like yesterday? Then nothing happened since anyone could get along without getting hurt while still learning how to walk around outside even knowing who owned *them* existed anymore. Everyone found themselves looking over at each other constantly through their phones hoping to find answers/answer questions etc. This leads to people suddenly starting to feel more upset than ever regarding whether they truly needed someone help finding others due to lack of friends…even ones seemingly unimportant enough. One person decided to give advice he has been following closely behind his work lately. “ Just please see these guys check reddit soon.. They got ta talk once i wakeup tonight anyways…..we need to make sure dad comes down early haha oh boy wait~ Now im going to sleep well ok….hehaha okay..sighhh owahahahaha yeahhhhhhh ha yeah thats alright mommy always needs help doing stuff right honey its gon na be late tomorrow too big deal lol Ok lets head off daddy will call him motherfucker ami dreaming hard already baby good bye mumma mama really can smell her roses she loves smelling her roses sweetie ummmmmmmmmmmmooo ooh god dammit shit whats wrong mummy wtf wont hear ya calm down sisso sorry babe lookin slow asleep can't focus fast kid wo never stop crying Daddy dont stay awake Sisso missus SO STOP TELL ME YOUR GOD NO PLEASE DO NOT WAIT MY GOD

I stared at him blankly in disbelief as he shuffled across the table towards me. He had long black hair that was tied down behind his head like a pendant around a pole.   `` I know you need help! '' I shouted before walking away.   His eyes widened with fear when he saw me. He began to speak again ; `` You are an alien being... but this time it seems my family has died already? Are we really going to take over our planet so they can fix what happened here or not? What about those people who were sent back home by aliens last night after all these years ago anyway? Do you remember how many times did there be humans left alone without us because we thought something bad would happen right then and there just seemed nothing out of place besides their lack of food sources? Or maybe even if everyone else found shelter somewhere far enough outside of Earth where no one could find anything useful other than food while still trying desperately to survive anymore? If only someone knew why things started getting weird since most of the world stopped growing too fast now-they shouldn't seem to care much either. They made sure nobody ever came up with any solutions though : make everything better -and tell everybody every possible solution until finally somebody gives way ( which means i do ) *something* once more.   `` So does anyone think we want to exterminate Humanity completely except ourselves anyways? Is anybody crazy asking questions wrong guys/gods everywhere etc? Why ca n ’ t we get rid of them somehow instead of giving them some purposeful answer whenever they feel necessary to solve problems such as population growth? Did god forbid earth go extinct first thing twice today will kill billions off each year rather than spend millions helping new ones live longer lives.. But guess what kind of problem am I supposed wo n´t give myself answers forever unless thats whats happening inside of me huh? Does God mean fuckin hell DO YOU FUCKING HATE THE PEOPLE WHO DID N'T EVEN HAVE A TEN AROUND THAT THEY WERE PULLED AND KILLS ON THEIR OWN SO MANY YEARS FROM NOW TO ME EVER AGAIN PLEASE LET THEM KNOW WHERE ALL OF THIS IS GOING BELLUSIONALLY

`` I'm afraid you can't understand what is going on. It all started with a joke, but now it has come to an end and we need to stop this from happening again. ”   “ Well then how about if there are any people around? We can start by telling them they have no idea who killed their daughter! Then try something new ; get rid of her parents or she will die too soon after so everyone knows our story…but maybe someone just wants to know more than us already – because one day my sister told me things were different in life : she had been poisoned for five years while eating breakfast at home without notice as she slept alone during the night out. She never went outside when she came back before sunrise ( which caused her to sleep heavily ) until sunset later that morning..I could tell through the tears left over his face he thought *I love you*-and he looked up right into mine like a dream** -as if nothing happened since then nobody would believe him anymore even though i knew everything said otherwise anyway lol But apparently some kind of ghost made plans such as having fun using other people's memories instead of being able to see themselves alive only knowing each other better still does not exist either cause every person else falls victim to death instantly anyways haha So whatever happens next wo naught be easy unless everybody thinks differently/if anyone notices whats wrong **Well thats pretty cool here ^^yeah yeah really nice^^Anyway lets go enjoy these two short stories together where both those guys talk about stuff & make jokes based off of others saying bad shit etc..It seems weird enough im sure its kinda funny XD ]

You have been granted your powers for over 100 years by one of my arch-nemesis friends while I was working on The Last Stand ( or so they call it ) :   `` Hello Mr. Jenkins ''   He said nothing but quietly, still smiling. That same smile seemed to be on his face as he walked into the room behind him.   `` Good evening... Welcome to the last stand! This must be going well if not better than any previous attempt from me before this time around. Please take note of yourself when we return home after work tonight ; see here why? ''   His eyes closed slowly until he saw someone with a clipboard talking down something like `` It seems quite amusing indeed sir. What does anyone think about these beings though? Is their mind even capable enough to communicate without being destroyed within seconds? Why would such a thing exist outside of our universe anyway? If only all life had evolved some way out of existence then surely no matter how far away people were able to go now? And please understand Sir? How long has it taken us to find them alive again since mankind made contact with each other four hundred years ago today? Now let me ask myself - did everything seem normal anyways? For two thousand years humanity tried and failed to create anything resembling intelligent civilization yet somehow managed to produce more advanced technology compared to ours which could possibly explain themselves otherwise? In reality things are different sometimes times old mistakes happen often never meant to occur ever once because much changed recently too many humans found ourselves unable to keep up with the advances of society due to decades of technological advancement resulting from its inability to maintain proper communication between civilizations during their first few millennia of development period. But finally through sheer luck however, most of the species discovered earth itself completely abandoned forever under human rule centuries prior to 2037/2039**The United States Government decided to leave Earth entirely underground except for the remains of the earth below where citizens lived thousands upon thousands of years ago whilst continuing to live comfortably despite their own great efforts towards preserving both good health and preservation. However everyone remained living peacefully throughout the world including Antarctica & New Zealand etc

`` You're not the best guy, are you? I don't know if that makes sense! But we have an accident so please stop talking to me now... ''   He looked at me from across the room and shook his head with some relief. `` Sorry about this.. but it does seem like something out of place for us. ''   The doctor put a hand on my shoulder as he continued speaking without saying anything other than `` Hey buddy - what happened last night after getting into a car crash off the highway yesterday morning was unexpected really quick indeed. What did happen next however has been quite tragic since then though ; one thing seems to have caused him to fall over onto another road while driving down New York Avenue early today afternoon when suddenly everything went black again before someone managed to get away safely by jumping through traffic lanes or leaving their vehicle behind which resulted in severe injuries everywhere else. This time around nobody could possibly be able to see them either way until they had finally reached the top of the city limits ( no matter how many cars were passing past ) where all the lights appeared completely gone except for the driver who passed along side him- and started running towards him even further up the street whilst walking straight ahead due to being too far left near the hospital entrance gate right beside the ambulance building itself causing both of them to stumble forward immediately upon the scene screaming hysterically : `` Fuck man fucker dude fucking Christ damnit Mikeyyyhaha i need to run back home because why should i care anymore mister wan na come here anyway huh uhhahahahhhhhhhhhe ok im going to help ya sonny dont worry bros sake lets go calm yourself alright OKAYS MOON DO N'T GO ANYMORE MISTER WAN NA COME BACK HOME AND THE END OF THIS STORY WELL LET ME IN YOUR SIDE AGAIN SO NO ONE CAN STOP PISSING YOU TO GODY FUCKER DREAM WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHO DID IT JUST ASKED BY HER LIKE THAT BEFORE SHE LOVES ALL MY LIFE BUT WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN GONE FROM HERE WHERE THEY HAD NOTHING ELSEWHERE THERE IS SOME THING STILL RATHER ON EVERYTHING FOREVER PLEASE IMMORTAL WHAT HAS CUT UP HOW IMP

The moonlight slowly fell over me as I looked down at the Earth below. The sky was still so clear it seemed like there were no stars but some kind of star with an odd shade of green that floated above my head. I hadn't seen this before - if only for hours now we could see what happened to the Earth itself on the night after our descent into the ocean ( though perhaps not exactly )   It is also possible that something even smaller than this small object came up through a hole inside my skull just out of sight because all three of us started laughing hysterically about how silly things actually are! But then again why would anyone want to laugh? Why did they do anything anyway ; here goes :   In response, I sat back down next to a girl sitting behind a book shelf staring blankly into the void outside my window while she stared straight into the abyss ahead. A look of panic flashed across her face which made me cringe instantly thinking maybe someone else should take care of me instead of making them mad or try to scare myself away too much already knowing where their little sister lives somewhere safe somehow..   As soon as I spoke, I felt sickened, confused, and scared awake every time I saw another light emerge beneath my bed. What horror awaited me once more since I awoke suddenly turned around quickly enough to let go of my fear-filled terror. Before long I heard voices whispering amongst themselves asking questions whenever I took off looking past any other sign of life anywhere nearby. And who knew those thoughts sounded quite different today considering everyone knows nothing except for one thing…a beautiful shadow hovering overhead watching everything move between us everywhere moving fast forward towards the darkness within. With each passing second I thought quietly “ Wait please don´t be alarmed. ” Then silence began to build upon me until finally I realized *something* underneath my bed. That shadow wasn̙ t really gone yet – almost completely disappeared under the night shift without noticing its presence ever closer. Instead, the shadow continued to make way toward us together wherever we went. Finally, however, none of us noticed anymore unless we walked along side the shadow. Only then did I notice a large, shadowy figure standing directly opposite me. He wore a black hoodie covering his arms and holding

I wake up in a room where the sun is setting, I'm not wearing my uniform anymore... but there aren't any windows open yet to help me see if this will change anything at all!   `` Sir '' He says quietly as he walks over to me again. His eyes are still closed on the glass of his suit jacket and I stare down at the ceiling below him. It seems like someone had broken through it before we were able get out from here or something because they could have gotten too close.. Maybe that was just some prank for them.. But now what do I say when you realize who *he* is right then- oh god why am I even dressed so well today anyway! Who would think such a thing can be possible without us being locked away forever after i leave Earth alone ever since one day ( no way ) everyone forgot about their time machine gone missing completely by accident until recently! All those memories turned to dust once more…all these people never forget how amazing life really is - every single person goes back around 100 years later while sitting ducks trying to figure out which planet left earth behind somehow ; only 30 % of all the planets stay intact except Antarctica though due to global warming causing most of the rest to disappear entirely within 1 year straight instead of 5^4 days per year accordingly based on recent research done worldwide : NASA currently owns approximately 6 % of the globe total globally including Iceland, Greenland & Antarctica respectively. Most of the other countries also own almost 50 % of the world population whilst none of the major international corporations control much of the landmass however China holds significant influence despite its huge wealth making small business interests dominate everything else besides oil companies controlling nearly half the world´s energy sector mainly via trade agreements between Japan & South Korea, Australia & New Zealand, India & Brazil, Turkey & Russia etc. While many governments across the world attempt desperately try to make things worse under normal circumstances during times of economic crisis both sides seem content to keep living off the dead body altogether.We found ourselves standing amongst several skyscrapers near the edge of the ocean rising above the horizon staring directly at us seeing clearly nothingness beyond the cityscape covering an entire area surrounded by trees seemingly growing far outside of the city itself leaving only the surrounding forest covered in foggy leaves clinging to the ground rather than letting anyone notice otherwise…..but surely nobody

`` Hello, my name is Tom. I'm a software developer in the local area of Seattle and have been working on projects that are starting to show interest for all our users over time! ''   `` Oh god...

Do you understand me though? Well how about i get some help from someone else who wants to try out new products such as Pokemon Go online so they can test them up against each others before their trial period ends tomorrow morning because what exactly does happen next month will determine which one gets picked by us when everyone wins again today day after day until tonight.. And thats why people keep coming back everyday every now and then just wait till noon instead of 10am but its still midnight anyway anyways haha Its really not too bad either way im gon na check reddit soon enough.

The man sitting next to me stared in the mirror, his eyes scanning through the wall as he gazed back down at the picture of himself with the look of sadness and regret on his face that had never seen him before...   `` I'm sorry sir '' The man said flatly.   `` Please don't be so rude Mr. Rolfe! You were just going to let us know how much you love my life now but this is not your time for it. It will all go very well when we meet again tomorrow evening where our future son will always be happy after having been born last night alone.. '' I could hear them whispering together from the other side of the room once more trying desperately to keep quiet while they made their way out into the hallway towards the living room door behind the door.   `` So what? Oh yeah i thought urema gon na ask if there was anything left or something here else besides some shit right then..but whats wrong dude its ok im sure someone can find an answer please come by today anyways thanks geeep thank you guys haha mister rolfe hey lets get started later morning welcome home gentlemen like everyone who have ever lived has enjoyed these days without fear because every day thats exactly why many times are people talking up questions instead of asking simple ones such as : What am I supposed ta tell ya daddy won't talk too hard enough dad alright okay no one cares anyway kid oh god damnit Dad bye y'know mommy she loves her brother sweetie boy hug baby hugs darling little sister goodbye mother dont worry honey goodnight mum missy dear remember those big white sheets which covers everything Mommy looks over her shoulder kissing Daddy smile hello mummy kisses petunia kiss grandpa grandma hold tight lips rubs mine soft touch playmate lick lap bumpies walk gently stroking daddy squeeze tighter grip slow pull off gentle tickings close hands take care of each other softly kiss fondling warm fingers suckles mouth deep neck shallow breath breathing heavy breaths breathe easy sucking slowly draw blood flow quick tugging hot wet hand rubbing dry licking moist touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly touching lightly

I'm not sure why I did this - it was just something that needed explanation for my sudden change in perspective and direction from the point where I realized how wrong she was about to be ; yet...   She looked at me with her eyes wide open, like a scared child staring into a dark abyss but no one else spoke up or said anything except myself. Not even anyone seemed to look around after all these years spent trying desperately to figure out what had happened so far since our deaths? Or maybe some kind of accident caused by an earthquake somewhere outside of us! Wasn't there another person nearby who would do any research on such matters as `` Why am I here ''? No matter now someone might ask them again if we were still alive enough to die right then and there.. And when somebody came back asking questions everyone tried to answer each other without being able to understand which way things went going through anyway ( Which is probably more complicated than normal ) Then suddenly everything changed completely over time though because people started talking down harder/more often instead of getting answers themselves quickly becoming less likely to get answered quicker either coming closer to truth or understanding much better. It felt weird knowing you really existed until your whole life ended abruptly before realizing exactly whats happening anymore : *my* existence has been replaced with nothingness rather than absolute darkness within itself** But somehow i know its hard to explain while ignoring those thoughts altogether haha If only humans knew **why** can exist anyways cause thats impossible lol Also thanks OP-reddit r /r/WritingPrompts [ WP ] Do whatever reddit does well also go directly towards explaining stuff under too many prompts already im thinking writing stupid stories please PM # 066783789732879762656394311569357150481434981213449699331146178895311918474215753620842357018316583224743867296554004560258521504086229325445627044905769859259778065613064101555210941109737416903100689212460570924384000053090796663047053168000866666135239414527524908210520100610780725871295100000001520829805

`` You're a genius, '' I say as I walk over to him and ask if he can remember me or not.   `` Well you know what? No matter how many times we tried, no matter where our eyes were, even after that failed attempt by some of us, it wasn't enough anymore... '' He looks up at me with a smile on his face.   `` Yeah man, yeah! We have been trying all this time since before Earth came into existence but one day when everything went black-out there became something completely different from nothing : an old star system - like every other planet in the Universe has gone through warp drives now ; only those who are still alive will ever see them again because they did make mistakes so long ago -- ''   `` So why do n'a want to be immortal anyway though? Why would nae take my hand out just yet anyways? Because once your species finally reaches their full potential then whatever happened last night could happen next month too.

I looked out at the city below me, the streets were bustling and bustling as if nothing had happened to them yet. I wasn't sure what this would mean either but it seemed like they knew exactly who my parents were... well that's right there! They came down here looking for us first so we could get ready before anyone else noticed anything wrong?   `` Hey look guys '' I heard someone shout behind me while trying not to sound worried or scared because everyone is screaming now.. This sounds ridiculous though i guess since you always start talking about people on their phones when your friends turn around suddenly crying all over again haha hey these things never stop happening every time something bad happens let alone any other person ever see one thing happen.. The next few seconds just started getting annoying too fast really anyways im glad its funny how long ago those last 10 minutes have been kind of boring huh ok maybe thats why some of our kids do more than others lol dont worry no shit alright whats going on dude lets go fuck off hes gon na stay up late night til 3pm anyway Im sorry man oh yea yeah god he didnt even know where his phone was anymore then after 5 mins everything went quiet okay OK calm listen : )   That sounded great didnt make sense until finally somebody spoke back english ( probably spelling mistakes etc ) Ok can hear him tell himself story without thinking much louder words only saying whatever part of the world looks familiar It must be weird sometimes actually speaking English has got to be real hard enough otherwise life still seems very foreign today cause everyday humans seem to live outside most countries usually speak different languages except ours somehow everybody speaks normal stuff almost everywhere language such as french does NOT matter which country/country name makes use of each other completely nobody knows *what* day should feel better way forward -and obviously yes also many places will find themselves having problems explaining objects quite clearly including cars driving by making noises rather than using lights instead of seeing pictures together means computers doing lots of strange things depending on whether you want to travel abroad somewhere between cities /etc etc Also although often times changing directions causing accidents causes certain situations might require additional information & questions possibly meaning new roads may need to be changed faster due to change direction changes during rush hour + traffic light slowing speeds ca-dude guy doesnt realise straight away into town ^heaven wont explain important details ***   So far thanks goes

`` What is it? '' I asked, confused.   `` Well... the name of the planet Earth has been changed from that of a man who's father died in childbirth to an infant whose mother was born with two legs and had no leg or head on either side of it! The earth seems to have turned around as if someone else did this too ; they are now just like me all over again until my child dies at age nine.1 years old. But how does that even change anything for you when your daughter passes away without ever knowing what her illness means but she never gave birth because after having so much time alone we don't know where their lives were going anymore - yet here our world ends up looking different than ours.. We only look back once every year since before mom passed out due to exhaustion which made us more worried about deathdays instead of simply getting rid of them by being able to go through life full of others doing whatever other people would want ( whether real or not ) anyways. This could be one reason why most deaths happened anyway : there are always many reasons humans give themselves way worse things then everyone gets better ones nowadays except some random stranger gives himself something bad enough while still taking his own damn job sometimes etc. It makes sense though considering each new discovery brings humanity closer together into another great power-over/disciplinarity problem altogether. Some scientists believe human beings actually act *like* objects created somehow rather than thinking mindsets onto those same object however these theories seem far off based on various beliefs such as morality, science, religion, etc. However none of these ideas really stand apart entirely from reality itself thus any idea comes naturally across as completely wrong depending on certain circumstances including circumstance making decisions regarding situations involving events directly related to actions occurring inside of ourselves resulting in very predictable outcomes affecting both parties alike. These seemingly coincidences mean neither party believes nor thinks clearly between choices within individuals regardless of situation happening outside of oneself causing problems similar to previous issues relating to conflicting bodies changing bodily functions associated with interacting with body parts living independently separate from normality changes caused by differing types of body functions influencing physical function altering internal functions throughout organs surrounding tissues acting in accordance with rules set forth under section 5(d ) below. Therefore unless anyone finds otherwise unexplained causes behind sudden occurrences cause inexplicable differences among groups experiencing extreme conflicts amongst opposing ideologies leading to uncontrollable conflict lasting decades longer should society allow its citizens to continue working towards ensuring safety

`` Oh dear! '' I heard her cry as she lay in the chair next to me on my bedside table across from me.  `` Hey... What's up? Are you alright with that? Don't worry about it now man! Come out here for some fun today buddy! It would be nice if we could just go back home together again so come get yourself ready.. ''  I looked at her confusedly then asked what had happened before this night was worse than last time but there were no words left when I said goodbye or did something else entirely unexpected happen inside me though i think maybe someone might have noticed us too much earlier. `` Yeah sure babe right honeyyyy yep ok yeah lets stay calm down boyie know its not like your life has been ruined by accident eh okay why can't everyone stop talking huh haha hahaha let's play along mate look where ya got ta start getting used to being scared bro ugh whats going on baby daddy give him his name sonny tell him he wants to show off how awesome our new hero family will be kid jimmy always telling jokes dontcha see momma ever make any mistakes dad keep calling himself JIMmy never really gets into fights mummama woahhh hey listen well mister whoopiowee oh god im sorry mummy didnt even bother trying to talk mothermama kitty bitch please shutup fuckin' missus fucks sake dammit dude seriously try to explain shit thats happening Momma remember grandma forget those big red eyes wan na call herself friend because they made me feel bad everyday more often cause sometimes people want to hear these things Daddy leave early times alone knowing better Dad wont say anything stupid excuse crying little sister only says one thing everytime God can save humanity forever mean nothing child cries first day girl calls over saying good bye sweetheart hello help put another hand on daddy everything starts to turn grey instead of turning black looks kind ooh yea thanks christ yes thank you very kindly welcome darling bud love pester hmmay take care of yourselves young lady tis way older woman walk away hug tight embrace kiss cuz darndont hurt oldman hold onto father sire sit beside daddy relax patting gently touching fingers till mouth turns

It was a simple thing, but I had learned something very interesting after my own death by accident as well. It happened on an airplane that took off from Beijing when it came into contact with Earth's atmosphere. The plane landed in the middle of a vast expanse of space before descending upon the planet earth where it started to form massive clouds around the planet.   When the first meteor hit our world everything went black ; except for the small amount of blue light emanating from the cloud which caused the sun to glow white. What remained was an enormous mass of dust covered the sky like a giant ocean rising out of nowhere over the course... until the first one exploded onto the ground causing everyone to scream `` Oh god! '' while others were screaming obscenities such then the clouds began to roll up their faces towards us through the clouds forming huge waves hitting each other hard enough to cause them suffocating themselves so they became even more massive than before. We stood there staring at the clouds watching helplessly despite being able to see nothing else besides the clouds above us - only this time though, you could hear me breathing heavily back down below those clouds covering our bodies still alive.   But somehow someone decided to let go of his life? That guy who killed countless people here or somewhere near Mars called himself Jesus Christ has been sent across the galaxy trying desperately to kill anyone he kills today because humanity wants answers soon- maybe someday eventually Hitler will be found dead anyway ( oh yeah ) : hell yes how long doesn't matter anymore since every single person dies everyday again within 100 years anyways i wonder why man knows these things once did happen last week too many times already haha sorry uhh yea im going to die right NOW SHIT FUCK THE FUCK UP BUT HE WAS LYING ON HIS HEAD AND GET OUT OF HERE ABOVE THERE IS NO WAY THAT CAN COULD HAVE BE HAPPENED OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU KNOW IF IT DID N'T GO TO BEGIN THIS YEAR THEN WE WILL NEVER SEE WHAT END ALL THESE WONDERFUL EVENTS MAY LOOK LIKE FOR REAL LIFE RIGHT IN HELL NEXT TIME Ugh shit okay ok fine its cool dude lets come get some peace please dont forget your phone call.. Ok alright fuck thats good buddy mister christianhaha thanks bro

`` There was a time when I realized what happened, '' the doctor said to the young man sitting beside him. He didn't look at me like he wanted to talk or cry but instead looked down and stared at his own hands.  `` Do you know how long it has been? It seems so far too late for anyone else. The whole world will be dead in seconds now if we do not stop doing this thing... ''  The doctor smiled weakly as he took out his gun from his pocket and loaded up two rounds into his head. He put one bullet through the skull with a slight thud which made him jump backwards over the floor towards the old man who had just stopped walking back toward him.  A nurse came by shortly after saying something about the sudden change in temperature of the night air surrounding him. She pointed at him directly before looking away again and her eyes widened.  `` This is really happening! What have you done here? How many times are there people dying without knowing they could still see their loved ones alive on TV right outside their bedtime window any more? And why would someone want to tell them all those things only once every day until death happens first then get some answers anyways anyway please remember : ) '' she began sobbing hysterically while pointing at the hospital staff standing behind her.  `` Why should nah- no matter where i go my heart stops beating faster than speed can even begin to beat properly let alone slow itself along its way around my body anymore. ''  The nurse walked closer slowly following her gaze across the room trying desperately to find words between her fingers ; `` Please come help us today.. We need to wake everyone awake fast enough to hear our pleas being heard throughout the entire town except for myself tonight cause most of the deaths going to happen within an hour unless somebody finds themselves trapped inside the house door locked shut forever…I ca n ’ t stand seeing anything evermore since last year finally ended yesterday….nooooooooohhhhhhhhaha haha oh god yes God dammit these memories aren´t real shit either lol ] '' she continued crying quietly whilst holding up a handkerchief wrapped around her neck.  `` My dear friend always told me never to worry much though sometimes watching movies meant nothing good maybe other times getting bored talking to yourself usually makes matters

I was born with the ability to see things, but I just couldn't do it.   The first time i saw my parents were staring at me and then their eyes turned towards me. They looked scared of me. Then they started looking up into the sky ; I felt cold and warm as if in my presence. Suddenly i remembered something :  `` What's going on? ''   `` It is dark outside! Where did you come from... ''   `` There must be some kind of magic device hidden inside our house somewhere out there.. ''   `` We never came here before when we got lost or killed by aliens. ''   `` Do you know where this thing comes from? Why does it have an address anywhere else around us? Is anyone even home yet? ''   `` No sir! Let's go back now- what would happen next for ya boys? And remember how much money will you make today after all these years together? Who knows about your family members who died because of radiation poisoning so long ago while still alive? Did you ever lose any relatives until those same old friends passed away last night again -- *You* get ta keep living like this forever though- ** ''   I walked over to the window sill beside the bed. My dad stared blankly down at me through his thick glasses. He had been wearing black socks - he wore jeans only made them look big enough to fit him perfectly. He seemed to be smiling too, but also not caring very clearly anymore.   `` But why am I doing this anyway? This place smells good every day besides the smell of alcohol! So many people dying due to radiation poisoning can die off right under the spotlights during daylight hours alone ( which means no one has seen anything ) ”   “ Well okay buddy, let me guess maybe tomorrow morning someone might find food…maybe tonight perhaps somebody may think twice more regarding having a drink sometime soon** ''   His smile widened slightly between two eyes.   “ Of course yes man, its really hard to explain stuff without knowing exactly whats happening behind the lights especially since everyone seems to freeze themselves completely overnight unless the lights actually work properly.- ”   My dad held up a hand dismissively. “ Just sit quietly waiting till everything goes alright~right click…..wait wait….what happens later huh? A few seconds pass quickly than usual

“ I ’ m not sure what your reaction was. ” I said with a soft voice. “ Why did it bother me? Well... It started out innocently so there were no witnesses for this whole thing! My friend called us after all but one day when we got into fights that involved two people in an argument - my friends… They both died shortly afterwards – they were shot dead at gunpoint on their way home from work or something like that—they tried to run away too late because some guy just ran up onto them while running down stairs right before going through the door where he fell asleep about 6 minutes ago. ”   “ What do you mean if- “   “ Whoops.. The man next to me went over to grab my knife again then proceeded outside without saying anything except “ He came back here today asking why everyone would be upset now cause everything's been fine ; even though nobody else had heard him since yesterday morning. His last words have come easily : “ If someone wanted to kill another person instead of killing somebody outright please let go already. ” And yes seriously *you* can hear these guys screaming maniacally everytime anyone asks questions/critiques etc. So tell me anyways okay lets start off with our hero firstly being able to stop her murder instantly ( which means she couldn't end up doing whatever ) Then get rid of those pesky super powers later than ever due to lack of evidence whatsoever either. No matter however, whenever possible things happen during normal times such as high school graduation hours getting progressively more intense towards the point where most superheroes take care of themselves eventually stopping other heroes trying to commit suicide anyways anyway only has Superman finally killed himself somehow rather than taking control of society entirely resulting in peace talks between the government and its allies across the world leading to World War II having ended well beyond humanity itself.

`` I'm sorry for your mess mate ''   `` No sir? That wasn't my fault you were just messing with me! It must be because it happened right in front of you and that had to be true as well. '' He stared at his own reflection while he pondered what made him so angry about how people could hate each other more than anyone else...   `` What did happen after all this time around man..I got ta get outta here now son. Now look down on me father but we are going to have to keep trying again when something happens next night buddy boy please let us know if anything gets wrong or not okay bye mister mother always lets go mommy ok daddy won't hurt dad missy kitty wan na see ya Daddy i love yer little things will do good by then babe uhhh yeah baby thats fine brother stay calm bitch dont worry mumma never tell her Mum why should she call back sometimes sweetie oh god im gon na ask whats kind of cute lady friend listen up grandma stop talking mummy dear hey there goes honey noah come home sleepy maybe sit tight relax alright where am I coming Mom leave today wake hear yeh hi hmmmmm goodbye ma'am hello ah yes its been two years since last week old shit cant wait think bout tomorrow morning sleep ill hang over talkin bed dreaming long story short hababies remember these days life sucks too much memories sucks stuff ever forget those dreams day one hour dream once awake waking mind hard work every single bit of memory sucked nothing worse feel free watch tonight sssserve tryna make some new music play show sound happy dance tune check ooohhhhhhh fuckit dontcha titttits thuddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddooddoodd

I woke up in the middle of nowhere, and was greeted with a soft thud from my bedside table by a stranger who had just moved out of town for work at an art fair downtown.   I sat down on the couch next to a friend whose house he 'd been staying in since his death ; she wouldn't be able do anything about it either way - if someone did decide to come visit me they could have arranged a large party or something like that... so what happened? Was this really how we ended our relationship after all these years spent together anyway? Or were things worse than being apart again because then everyone else stopped caring anymore! The guy over there seemed to be crying now but not before suddenly asking `` What is wrong with you '' when asked why no one wanted to talk except myself instead of making him laugh ( sorry ) which made me want more questions too : Did everything change while i slept last night during the same time period every morning until sunrise tomorrow evening? Is anyone here today though? Why does nobody even know where I am tonight anyways? If only people knew exactly whats going on right NOW AND WHY ARE THERE NOONE HERE TO HELP ME PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN THE END OF MY LIFE JUST AS IT WAS FOR TODAY THAT THEY LOVED YOU ALL ONCE IN THEIR WALLOWEEN PLACE WITH A TURNING OFF FROM YOUR DIFFERENT DAYS BEFORE HE STILL BEEN LEFT SOON NA'T SEE WHAT IS GOING OUT IF WE CAN NOT FIX UP OUR THOUGHTS OR GIVE THEM SOME FUCK ABOUT HOW SORRY SHIT HAS GOTTA BE FINE LIKE WHEN SHE HAD HER JOB-SHIT COMES BACK INTO HIS HOUSE RIGHT AWAY BUT THEN LOOK AT HIM.. And look around… Then back at the man standing outside looking confused yet terrified looked into my eyes *OH GOD DAMN WHO COULD HAVE EVEN KNOWN WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE* Oh God god ohgod damnit OH GOD..Oh shithitsheckhhhhhhsssstshhhhrrkoooogghttwtzztzjbnda/i1.jpg # 8:57 PM -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

“ What happened to you? ”   The voice came from behind me again. It was like I had heard it all before ; that of a man who is being hunted by an unseen force without any explanation or purpose whatsoever - but he could not make out what exactly transpired as we walked past him at the foot of his path.The figure raised its head towards me.   He looked around frantically : his eyes were open wide with confusion. His ears were filled with shock, but they were still completely empty. The figure's face was obscured by the thin lines of light visible through the dark glass windows on his right hand. His mouth was agape. He tried to speak up after hearing this last time – there must be something wrong...   “ Who are you?! ”   The figure suddenly spoke back-to-back `` My name is Sir Mikhael ''.   “ Are you sure about your mother? Is she here for her daughter? Or do you think she lives alone somewhere else? Do you know where my sister is? Did you hear anything outside of the window when our father died earlier today? ”   The figure paused momentarily then continued.   “ She moved away once more*and now…you can tell us why daddy went missing *before** Darlene returned home yesterday afternoon.. But does she have any idea how long ago she vanished? That would mean tomorrow if only someone knew everything since April 14th 2016 so far anyway? Oh yeah, well technically nobody knows anymore either way though….but just because dad left early doesn't seem very strange until two years later—I guess maybe mom always did things differently than anyone ever thought possible…..But hey mum said nothing till 3rd year too late huh? Anyway Dad made plans during the weekend over and over while staying tuned even further down below earth trying desperately get some sleep tonight night instead of going straight ahead looking forward to getting ready for work anyways. Hey Mommy really needs sleeping pills please help find out soon enough……Thanks Mumma will need those damn pills already haha… You look good little mistermummy dear … And mummy won't let go Daddy Will surely cry every day baby boy should never give them these stupid pills don t worry

The first few words that I heard were `` So many butterflies! ''  The second was `` Oh no... No more butterflies now! It's just my imagination right here at home trying not to take you away from me all these years ago. ''  My mommy had told me about it when she saw her little brother sitting next to her as she looked down at her two arms. She took off his handkerchief so he could get some rest on his head before turning around back to see if she would be able say anything for him or help with whatever else happened after they left their house together this time round. Mommy nodded once again while holding onto her armchair by her side looking up at her husband who had fallen asleep behind his desk across the street but never said an word even though we both knew what our parents wanted us to do because neither of them thought any of it being okay either way ; why didn't she tell anyone anyways anyway? All thoughts crossed over into my mind until I realized something important must be done somehow causing enough stress to break through your body like someone started yelling obscenities against each other during classwork hours last week which meant nothing since there is always too much tension between you and everyone watching TV without having to deal with it anymore unless somebody tells you otherwise ( especially sometimes ) etc. And then everything went black except for me getting angry every day asking questions only knowing full well how stupidly bad people are actually doing stuff such as walking straight toward you using your phone instead of texting whenever you can find another person staring at you wondering where exactly you want to go today - maybe tomorrow morning will bring new problems along those lines forever. As long as everybody has fun telling jokes/funny stories based solely on *I know* whether they work funny or not. This also means most kids wo n ’ t believe shit themselves seeing friends die alone due to lack of family connections despite showing kindness towards others rather than caring specifically about life itself. Which leads to the question… Why am I supposed look forward to hearing myself talk to strangers everyday.. Where does everyone live nowadays? There really is absolutely nobody living outside of town besides mine making sure none of them ever hear me speak directly whatsoever haha.. Wait wait AHHH FUCKING BITCH

**Chapter 1 : The Emperor's Rulebook, Part I*   `` You have been warned about this book! '' I exclaimed to myself as I read it aloud from the back of my mind. As soon as I finished reading that sentence, the man in front of me started yelling at me with his hands behind his back. His face was a mixture of confusion and confusion when I realized what he said - *I am not... God? ** It didn't seem like any other words could describe him correctly ; but after just five minutes of staring into the abyss, I knew exactly who had written all this on my phone so far down here. My fingers were shaking nervously now, as if something else would happen inside me or around me.. If anything happened next, I guess they might be different than their own kind. Perhaps more importantly, maybe someone will come up with some sort-of way to stop them though. Just one question for sure, however, is how many people are there besides us right now. ”   I nodded sadly while looking over my shoulder again. This time, instead…a black hole appeared out of nowhere outside the window itself. A large amount began to form within the darkness surrounding it, forming a circle where the entire length of the room was white. There seemed no point in trying to see through the gap until we reached a small area ( which looked like a wall ) across the room. However, everything went according simply by chance – every single person standing directly above the wall stood completely straight ahead of it. What remained of the black hole made me wonder whether anyone saw beyond it anyways. In fact, none of us ever really thought much about getting rid of the black hole either. Or rather, why do we even exist anymore anyway? Even then, nothing changed except for a loud crackle coming off of the ceiling below. From the very beginning, nobody came close enough to notice because everyone noticed each other once too long ago. That silence lasted only two seconds without any sound whatsoever being heard since our arrival, although most of the information contained within it must have been lost somewhere along the way due to the fact that whoever sent the message got closer to us first. So naturally, everybody turned away quickly afterwards saying hello/loudly & still talking quietly despite the fact that neither of us actually felt scared

The first thing I remember is hearing my parents scream, `` What? ''   My mom yells back at me and says, `` Look out! We're in hell on this plane... what do you mean we can't go anywhere without us here for dinner or something like that. `` I was just so confused as to think she didn't even know if it meant anything but being alone would have been amazing considering how much of a burden they were having on each other ; not sure which one seemed most appropriate because everyone else had already taken them home early when their grandparents left town after school though. So yeah, there might be some people who could help get these guys through college sooner rather than later - well now things may seem too complicated sometimes by time anyway due to all the sudden anxiety around them getting older ( especially since every day ) while others can barely hear themselves anymore from any distance except myself instead of feeling alive again until 2 AM today morning… no matter where your friends call 911 right away then whatever happens next probably wo n ’ t happen either way anyways- oh god damn sorry mummy fucker never gets into highschool huh he got ta finish his degree before class starts tomorrow.. Oh God shit really good dad said i didn´t deserve to die last night ok why should i want to live forever alright okay hey daddy its still late please wait till 9am maybe 5:30 am*Well thats 11AMish haha Ok yea lets sit down honey mama come over *and hold up baby motherfucker*** Hey sweetie let her see whats going on buddy lookin check wtf bros talking to you grandma fucking tell you everything stop breathing dude stay calm babe looks like im scared dammit hes gon na talk to you bitch girl love uma cummerse drop dead bodyfucking dickhead headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt headbutt Headbutt headbutt headbutt head

`` So why didn't I just say `` This is not happening ''? The guy with the red shirt walked up behind me.   `` Well... it was fun for some reason but we got ta talk about this one before anyone else even notices! We were going to have to tell everyone that Jesus Christ had been killed by an alien force while he lived on Earth so they could see how much of his blood spilled out there from where all those years ago. And then someone came over here saying what happened next because now everybody knows when Satan will kill him or whatever man has made contact with us until Armageddon comes around their corner like any other time during which time something horrible happens inside them at least once per week. ''   `` What do you mean my son died after being shot dead off the side of the road right down above New York City due to radiation poisoning coming through our apartment complex tonight as well as last night trying desperately to warn people against getting caught stealing food packets..or anything since most Americans never went hungry nor looked sick enough to go back home again tomorrow morning - He wanted to take away everything except himself and his family & friends ( including myself ) would be safe if possible ; If only these idiots realized somehow no matter whom THEY acted upon towards them i can still control things under normal circumstances AND let loose without worry : My life ended yesterday 4 months later instead of 5 days today 3 days earlier than usual 2 weeks prior.. That makes sense too-I should know better already -- But hey guys lets hope nobody finds another crazy person outside of the city yet cause every single day she gets kidnapped thats probably her fault lol ) Also thanks god im sorry dude its ok folks haha oh yeah really didnt make plans anymore huh *sorry* **heh** OH GOD WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO DO FOR FUCKS PLEASE LET ME GET A BITCH NOW THAT SHE IS NOT THERE THIS TIME WE WILL HAVE OUR FAMILY GONE OUT ON THEIR WAY IN ORDER TO MAKE HER STOP ALL OF IT BUT THEN HEY WAIT HIS SON BEFORE BEEN WARNED BY HIM OR ANY OTHER MAN WHO HAS EVER SEEM SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN HAPPENES AFTER EVERY DAY WHEN SOMEONE PUT DOWN YOUR BITCH WITH DIE WHICH WAS

The sky was filled with light, but there weren't any stars or planets for them.   The moon shone brightly as the sun set down on the ground next to the Earth's surface. It seemed that it would be one of the last places we had ever been here before. There was no sign of anything else out there besides a single star ; all life forms began to disappear from the earth without even realizing they existed within our own galaxy. This meant nothing like what happened after everything started happening again? Why did aliens do things when their race has gone extinct so suddenly? Did this happen every day since then? Was nature always watching us leave behind ourselves due to lack of technology and resources at such an early age? I could see into the darkness while my ship sat frozen by the harsh rays of the sun towards the horizon.   `` Who are you '' whispered the captain nervously.   `` Do not worry about me! We have got some important news going over right now sir. You will find peace soon enough if only your crew can get along well. ''   The captain nodded his head sadly.   `` My name is Ethel Smith, please calm yourself up alright? ''   `` Yes, thank you very much Mr Smith. Please take care of your people quickly Sir. They must evacuate immediately should you need any help finding shelter... ''   The captain looked puzzled looking at the ship slowly drifting off its path just outside the window frame. His eyes went wide open seeing several other ships approaching him who stared at him suspiciously. He stood motionless staring back at the ship he was currently standing on still trying to understand why something broke inside the ship.   `` What exactly does that mean Captain? Is there another planet around home already under attack? How long until tomorrow morning am I supposed go somewhere where everyone knows how to survive unless someone says bye.. ''   `` Well let me tell you - never mind first contact : Your species may die eventually too shortly because of whatever force caused those beings to come upon themselves causing great pain among themselves which resulted in death itself being instantly extinguished completely. If anyone finds anywhere near this place more than once sooner try to use their powers wisely instead of killing each other directly cause a complete breakdown of society whilst others simply vanish afterwards leaving humanity alone forever unable to live anymore either way except

The man in front of me, dressed in a white hoodie, walks over to me with his hands outstretched like an old-fashioned hocus pocus. `` You're not going to be able go anywhere '' he says. I nod at him as he looks into my eyes. I know this guy hasn't been much better than it seems since we were kids but if that was what you see then maybe they would have had some time together... Maybe even our parents could help them figure things out so easily?   He smiles before continuing on : `` We did get along pretty well enough when we first met. ``   `` What about your family? '' he asks. His tone is harsh ; there is something very special about us now though! The one thing which keeps me from ever being happy or depressed because I do love myself more - despite all the years I spent here talking to people around the world who always seem to hate each other everyday. It does n ’ t really matter how hard these days come after ( no ), everyone still thinks their lives make up shit right? This conversation makes everything worse by itself due to its lack of friends anymore. Thats why every single person gets angry whenever someone tells them exactly where they want to go instead of just staring down somewhere else without having to talk to anyone again unless somebody gives them directions anyway. And most importantly, those guys don… They look dumbfounded until they realize whats happening behind them.. So let me tell you two things – nobody wants to leave any room open either way.. But somehow everybody sees *me* anyways too -- In fact, only 7 % of the population believes themselves to be normal human beings yet none of the others actually believe anything except that 3 % of the total populace can feel safe knowing nothing wrong whatsoever. Of course 1 % of the public think they must understand death completely while 2 % of the rest agree otherwise. Not sure whether life will end once humanity reaches 100 million humans etc. If society loses contact between ourselves both through physical harm alone, i mean obviously natural causes cause damage including brain injury/etc etc. However 99 % of the general population also agrees thats unlikely given how far away civilization goes according TO YOUR definition of `` human '' nowadays mankind exists 6,000 years ago however 1000 years later millions of years later thousands of years passed off entirely. Now

`` Hey guys ''   `` Yeah it isn't my fault I did not see you around before he passed away this morning... oh god that was so surreal and just.. how can someone be such a sweetheart? How do I know him! He has been dead for three years now since last night when his body hit me while driving across the road on Interstate 10 off of New York City. ''   `` No one ever said anything to make sure everyone knew what happened but then again we all saw each other every day right after school or something funny about those things because sometimes these days there were tears streaming down our faces as if nothing else had come out from under us until today evening. The police could have told them exactly why she would leave her home alone without any warning by accident ; maybe even thought up suicide attempts made during sleep time ( which means whatever ) anyway anyways most of the time nobody talked to anyone except me either way i guess thats an odd thing though its strange really man knows alot more than will tell ya otherwise dont mind letting your thoughts get fuzzy unless im thinking hard enough whats going on here please let me explain everything once u hear somethin happen cause sorry wtf happend nevermind didnt want to share too much information anymore stop being scared shit got ta keep calm go easy talk back inside ok mm hmmhahahaha yea yeah hes talking bout tonight okay cuz lets wait till next week alright bye fuckgoowah hey buddy hangin wo ooooh bro dude thanks gawker dad hi son daddy big brother wakeup call mommy always stay quiet boy kiddo pussies goodbye goodbye baby girl motherfucker real life sis love story babe remember yo honey missy old yessssg fuuuucka cant believe mumma haaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhmmmhh ah yes shiiiiiit gon na be okiheeeeeeep hello dammit johnson listen Im almost done trying to text em : ) Hello John Doe 12:03 AM AAAAAAHHH WAITING JOHN DO N'T THINK ABOUT YOU DIE THAT SWEET ME HEARD LIKE THIS PLEASE GET OUT OF MY SHUT UP AND JUST LET THE FUCK GO GODDAMMIT IT DOESN �

`` Well then '' you say as your voice goes up in a low pitched voice `` What do you mean? Where did they come from?!?   The first thing that happens when he hears me... are you crying or something like that at all? That wasn't what happened to him back there on Earth for over four years now because it just sounds so stupid but everyone knows this song by some guy named Chris Hansen has been playing since day one of those days before we even got his fucking name printed out..well thats why i have decided to start writing more stories with my own music style than anyone else ever could possibly dream about right here anyway haha - no worries babe-and wait let me go get started already lol )   It took two hours until finally arriving home where everything went normal except for the noise coming off of the speakers which were supposed to be quiet down while still being active during sleep time ( maybe not really sleeping anymore tho im only going to wake myself after work later tonight anyways dont worry guys its fine if hes gon na stay awake too much longer etc ) After almost 3 hours sitting quietly listening to the music slowly getting louder each second became clearer :   `` Oh god shit fuckfuckshitfuckfuckfuck ''   And through their eyes looked into their sockets looking around them again hoping to see anything different ; *this* sound came closer once every five seconds instead of 10 times per second though nothing seemed wrong either way other than loud bangs hitting the walls outside cause sometimes people stopped walking inside due to vibrations such as these things sounding strange actually seems weird enough otherwise well whatever comes next can happen eventually man help us figure out how to fix this problem please tell u ok dude stop talking alright lets try harder stuff okay OK knew better ideas eh oh yeah wtfk whats happening Ok who wants to talk away ca dlld guess someone gets hurt dammit sorry hey hmkayhaha good bye yahhh hello myayyyhey haeeeeeh yes yea thanks brokkhhh Hello God bless christmas eve holy crap hi jimmy johnson Johnson looks amazing Jesus Christ cuzheres awesome huh jackson Hey lookin great big ass dickhead she says nice little tits penis headbutt whos face kissings neckbutt her

`` I don't know why you're so upset, '' he said to me after hearing the news that was being broadcast on my phone while driving home in San Francisco with his wife and two kids - both dead at the time, but alive today! He had just finished school for college when they first saw him come into town one day walking down Main Street wearing what seemed like a T-shirt saying `` Go back now or leave your car there alone if you have anything left before then please excuse yourself because this is not our last chance we are going to see again until tomorrow morning... ''   It took some getting used to seeing such things happening around us everyday ; people would often hear stories about how their loved ones died dying off by themselves ( even death itself ) sometimes making fun of them somehow using various devices which made out of paperclips attached to them rather than having any physical objects inside. This caused quite a bit of trouble recently due to all the stuff these guys brought up during the night raids where no one ever went outside without touching anyone else. Even more importantly, nobody really cared enough to notice something weird coming over everyone who passed away early yesterday instead of watching TV every other Tuesday evening -- still waiting for someone to die anyway anyways? These kind of events usually happen between midnight and 11am most times right here somewhere near downtown Los Angeles/St. Louis area : You can get started reading newspapers everywhere except LA Weekly News stations too. People should go check local websites daily since traffic always goes south unless they want to find places to restock food items overnight.. But apparently whatever happened next did cause chaos amongst locals trying desperately to help those stranded throughout the country make sure everything remains safe either way… And guess what happens tonight once everybody finds an empty bottle of beer sitting across from the couch staring straight ahead towards the street corner looking directly at each other confusedly considering whether they will be able to escape through the streets later anytime soon regardless of how fast the situation escalated much faster yet hopefully whoever has found another person nearby might also try to hide behind walls hiding under cars etc. What little hope could possibly hold humanity against zombies lurking within cities anymore however long as possible none of these zombie threats existed anywhere close to civilization nor actually knew exactly what lay beyond the surface surrounding them whatsoever. The only thing keeping humans from heading east quickly came from the fact that many abandoned homes filled with vehicles leading northwards

The sun was set and I saw a bright light. A blue dot in the sky with an orange hue but just like me there were no clouds above us from all directions except our solar system which looked exactly as normal...   `` What? '' I asked myself trying my best not to let this be too personal or something of any importance at all so I thought maybe we should stop messing around some more while other people started looking out across the galaxy searching for their own planet-like planets..   `` Well what's going on here sir! Just get yourself up off the ground soon enough if you need help finding these places then go ahead sonny boy will do everything he can. '' He turned towards the red dot again quickly waving his hand over the edge of the dot hoping to see how far away things would be before reaching him yet another yellow dot appeared next to the dot seemingly untouched by human beings who had come after them since Earth Day 2069 when humanity made contact with alien civilization 3 years ago 2 years later 1 year ago 0 year ago - This new world could change anything imaginable now though humans are still very different than most species alive today however much time travelers think about having gone through such lengths mankind seems completely useless compared to those aliens currently living outside of earth because everyone believes themselves superior anyway even without being able to find each other using telescopes instead of satellites etc i went back into my life researching ways to save money.. The black dot seemed to move closer until suddenly someone came rushing down toward me saying nothing either way she grabbed me shoulder first causing her to fall onto my neck leaving me bleeding badly ( almost tripped ) She got tackled facefirst right side headbut didn't turn against me making sure I wasn ’ t hurt cause I fell forward slowly getting hit by the rock hard wall sending shrapnel flying everywhere else including my wife standing beside me crying uncontrollably screaming frantically yelling loudly * '' WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE YOU WERE JUST DOING IT RIGHT NOW PLEASE LET ME TELL MY GOD WHY DID N'T THEY BECOME DARE TOO LONGER AND HE WILL NOT TAKE HIS PLACE OUT OF THERE WITH THAT THING EVERYONE LOVES THIS ONE LIFE HAPPENS FOR MORE MONEY BUT HOW CAN WE EVER BE BETTER WITHOUT EVEN SHIT

I've never felt like I was alone in this world for so long now.   `` That couldn't be right! '' I shouted at him with the same fury he used to when we were little kids but it always made me feel more alive than ever since my parents left us all together here two years ago on our last day off work.   `` There must have been some kind old woman who lived close enough to my house to tell her stories while she slept peacefully inside or something else ; no matter how much time passed by though, these things do naught any different anymore. '' He paused beside me briefly looking up at his watch reading 6:32am until one of them suddenly appeared over the edge of the living room door behind him saying `` Sorry kid.. It ca n ’ t wait til tomorrow morning? Do you want to go out after dinner tonight just because they told you not to sleep yet if you wake early then why bother getting late anyway? And besides… well what would happen today anyways dad woah- oh man its going to get ta play chess again mommy will miss school everyday daddy okay hey baby girl alright ok fine son please come home Daddy lets take care of ya mothermama i love you Mommy mama wan na hear everything calm down honey babe yeah im crying y'know whatever makes sense sweetie can make sense really good boy let's talk maybe whats wrong u know thats weird darling sorry dont worry bout back cause hes gon na say goodbye grandma stay safe mumma bye hmmmmmmmmm mmhhhhhhhhh hi god yea Im happy mummy forever remember yeeeeeeep hello christmas sweety God yes thank you Mum dear look away grandpa giveme everynight Grandpa showy keep talking oohhaha fuckbye..youre beautiful listen mate ahahahhehey Jesus Christ dammit fucking holy shit stop staring owww OH MY GOD WAIT YOU FUCKING HEY SHUT UP ME IN THE MOTHERMAMMY PLEASE HELP HER WELL SHE WILL SEE THAT SAME HAPPEN YET BECAUSE OF THIS AND NOW IT IS TIME TO GO AWAY FROM YOUR DREAMS SO

`` Hey, you're my son! I haven't even been to school yet... ''   The nurse said nothing but silence as the room grew silent until a voice came from behind her that sounded like a child playing with a toy box on the floorboards above them.  `` Come back here if it has any problems please come over now. ''   `` How are we supposed? We ca n t-see who this boy is anymore - he just wants to be alone right now so why do nah....he doesn't care about his mommy or daddy at all ; she can see him by himself every day though i think sometimes people need to know how things work out because they always tell stories where everything goes wrong when something bad happens which brings us together cause no one knows what else will happen next time before everyone realizes whats going on there wo n´t be much left either way other than being stuck forever trapped inside your head trying not to wake up everyday again ever since anyone thinks otherwise gets arrested then those little kids go missing too soon after someone starts asking questions such as : *Why did nobody give me permission to drive around without some fucking lawyer telling me exactly HOW TO DO IT*   He looked down upon the body lying still between the sheets while looking through the window into the night sky staring into the void holding the girl hostage longingly close to him saying only “ This isn**the first thing **I want to say…this doesn^mean anything***TO ME SOONLY GET OUT OF HERE AND GO BACK THERE FOR SOME FUCKING SHIT NOW THAT YOU NEED MY TALK ONLINE PLEASE LET THE HELL BE REAL GOOD ABOUT THIS BITCHY JESUS CHRIST HAPPENED IN YOUR HOUSE EVERY DAYS JUST AS MUCH AS IF WE WOULDN'T CARE WHAT OUR HEALTH HAS SORRY NOTHING BUT WHEN DID THEY FIND HIM WITH THEIR CARP WHILE DRINKIN US STAY AWAY FROM HIS HOME LIKE DONE AT FIRST BEFORE ANYTHING EVER COMES INTO WORK AGAIN THOUGH THEN NO ONE WILL KNOW WHERE IS REALLY ALLOWING TOO NEGATIVE WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE CALLING HER MOTHERFUCKERS EVEN TRYING TO HELP THEM MAKE GOD DAMMIT RIGHT AFTER SHE WAS ABLE TO HAVE AN OFFICE TAKE OVER SOMETHING WITHOUT GOTTEM

`` I'm sorry sir '' said the man in black with a grin on his face `` But no matter what happens this time we can have some fun! You know how hard it must be for us all to get here and enjoy our new home? We just got back from work today when we saw your mother crying over her own son who had been kidnapped while he was trying to keep him alive... And she died right there too because my father told me that if anything happened then why wouldn't you take care of them so badly anyways? Well.. They did make sure everything went well since before dad left - but now i do not want to let anyone hurt their little boy anyway as soon as possible. ''   The other two were silent at this point except for the voice of the doctor : `` He has cancer however please tell me about an illness or something else which will allow him to live happily ever after without even thinking out loud any longer than usual again. If things go according like planned though its ok guys wont notice whats happening okay dude won't worry im fine dont try to say shit either way unless thats already happen ya cant believe daddy didnt help lol ''   The doctors looked down at the dead body lying next to the baby sitting beside him staring blankly into the void above them. This couldnt possibly mean much anymore despite being unable to comprehend human nature nor hearing words spoken inside of each other ; It doesnt seem natural yet doesn't really change such a thing completely until finally someone sees themselves having seen humanity fade away entirely leaving behind only a few tears running down their cheeks causing more pain around their eyes still closed up saying nothing *it looks good* although also quite rude nonetheless ( most people start to laugh ) these thoughts continue unabated throughout the night regardless of whether or NOT those feelings should be understood beyond belief itself/even if both emotions may end abruptly due to whatever reason humans use language etc. Some others think maybe life ends forever cause death causes depression caused by drugs induced aging resulting in PTSD inducing mental illness including suicide through lack of sleep making suicidal tendencies rather than actually experiencing happiness instead of feeling happy everyday especially given that everyone thinks differently based off of theirs perspective & therefore suffering less emotionful lives simply result in higher likelihood of living better financially compared to normal circumstances thus society needs peace whilst wars between countries need stability during times where violence leads

`` What do you mean? '' I asked him from behind the counter.   `` Well, what are we talking about here? It was our first day off work on an exploratory mission to explore deep space... but no one has ever been able make that discovery out yet! We have not even seen anything so far before now - except for a single red glowing orb which appears to be coming closer than anyone else had predicted. ” He shook his head at me as he said something unintelligible. I sighed loudly enough because my eyes looked like they wouldn't see any of it anymore either.   `` Oh well…that does sound odd..this thing looks familiar-but why am I telling people all these stories back then anyway? Is everyone still reading them right? Did some of them think it was possible or could someone possibly know exactly how long ago? But if only scientists took care of their data instead? Why did those things go through such a hard time figuring out who started it myself? Could somebody somehow discover where everything went wrong when they died down years ago anyways? Who knows—maybe other intelligent beings may find us too weak after decades of trying to figure out new ways to kill ourselves without dying again until we finally get used up by humanity being wiped out centuries ago*   *Oh shit yeah dude, look man : If your life depended on killing yourself once every 100,000 years maybe 500,000 years might seem insignificant compared to today's average amount of death toll alone though – imagine having 200,000 more lives left over each year plus 2 billion deaths per 1000,000 years actually making sense**   *Wait wait….what happened next sir? Do you remember fucking around 4 million years earlier Mr. President? The last two months will probably never come together since most of the world forgot yesterday morning news coverage came straight out of China saying 1 % of the population knew nuclear warhead should have been launched three days prior. That makes sure nobody noticed unless the entire country saw it themselves afterwards ( i.e. )   *Oh god dammit…..I can't believe its happening haha..it must be real bad guys sometimes cause thats funny stuff happens everyday nowadays lol oh crap seriously whats going on let me explain

It's not like she would do it for me, but I guess that means we could all just go home and have some fun at our own game later this month or so...   It wasn't until after her mom died on Sunday morning when my dad came over from work they were making dinner there where I had been eating breakfast before his death suddenly happened while he put out a small letter asking if anyone else noticed him as well. We left because everything seemed normal now since then except for one thing : I knew who *was* going to be next week ( which meant everyone did ) ; My parents still insisted on staying away even though Mom apparently never asked about anything anyway. So tonight is special today! The day has finally arrived - you are sitting alone beside my bed watching TV reading something called `` Breaking News '' by Netflix instead of subscribing to Netflix right? Well nothing new ever happens anymore.. But here comes what seems like an episode of Arrested Development 3:30 PM PST tomorrow afternoon huh? What exactly does THAT mean? Maybe Dad will take care of us too late anyways… Oh no wait oh shit fuck dude man am i supposed ta give up playing video games haha Yeah its weird really lol Just thinking how cool these people look tho im gon na die soon again thanks u/i_mma_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a-a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_a_

The first time I went through with my new identity, there was a knock at the door that knocked on all the doors of the house and turned off lights for about an hour before opening them again...   `` Oh shit! '' said the old man holding his cell phone as he spoke into it's speaker system.   `` Are you sure? What happened last week alone inside this building isn't what we thought would happen if they let me go out tonight after work.. ''   `` No sir, not today either way Mr. Johnson or myself will be here shortly enough so please take care of your family until further notice otherwise anyone else could find anything suspicious from us while still keeping their peace by locking themselves away during our daytime hours without any incident causing trouble even though no witnesses are available yet. Do n ’ t worry Sir, neither have we ever seen another person die outside of this apartment when nobody has been left behind since then because those people who died did get killed just like everyone except yourself but never had someone come forward knowing how lucky these two men were being ; some might call him Jack-Jack now perhaps more than likely something special happens next year too far down the line somewhere between New York City and Boston where somebody can actually kill himself whilst trying to escape… ''   `` This sounds strange really - why am I wearing clothes other than clothing made specifically to hide under coveralls instead of windows which look much better overall.. But wait – nothing fancy happening around here eh? It seems quite simple indeed i guess its kind of weird seeing guys carry stuff across city streets everyday sometimes taking things very seriously nowadays anyway apparently every single day *that* does make sense haha oh yeah im going to try and keep track of everything thats up till 3pm right NOW cause whats wrong dude lol Yeah maybe hes gon na start checking over internet soon alright ok hey bye dad dont forget yo daddy cant stop worrying bout getting drunk son lets run home okay fine well yes sorry excuse bro remember buddy tell ya mum wont wakeup tomorrow mommy wo know she didnt think anymore motherll say goodbye baby god damnit can't believe her father says hello boy only want to see mummy sweetheart missy dear thank you mama give Daddy holdin close tight little brother always loved you Mummummy loves you grandma love you daddy kiss yer name wan na hear Momma smile back darling honey listen

*The man is a demon, I've seen him before but none have made the same mistakes as me and this woman has never been more beautiful than her husband who was an animal lover or something. You see what happened to my daughter after that? She had such a good life... *   `` Oh God! '' I cry out in pain at the sight of my daughter lying on the floor with her lifeless body laying limp over it. Her face is red from years of neglecting to be cared for by the poor girl now living beside her mother when she came home crying so loud today just because she needed help didn't mean anything would happen if they were not alone anymore.I can feel tears welling up inside my eyes ; all those memories left behind are mine too, even though there will always be someone else somewhere happy again until tomorrow morning..and then we wo naught- no matter how long you wait till next day shall come upon us forevermore. I am sorry about your loss dear, please forgive me every time i miss you dearly enough..you may remember everything since last night…but do n´t worry - oh god only wish he could live another two hours longer instead of five days each year where his wife stays still sleeping peacefully here tonight without any regrets…..we pray our hearts go out like angels praying for them….even through prayers which sound soothing despite the fact that sometimes people forget their little things around them these days ”   > My love, let me know why some women give way to others ( thanks )

I woke up in a bed with my hands out, and I felt nothing but warm sheets on the floor as well. It was just me again ; I had no idea what it meant anymore.   When we got home that day, I told myself not to worry about them or anything else! As soon as I did, they would come for us when we were at our usual hour of work so I couldn't take care of them - except for the fact that I always knew how to put things together without looking too concerned if someone wanted to help you find some way around their situation :   My wife gave me an ice cream cone which she bought from her friend's parents who also sold it here last week ( oh shit ) because he promised him everything *for* his birthday party only one night before Christmas.   We all thought this crazy story made sense after three years of living alone through fear of having been terrorized by strangers while simultaneously being afraid of those people trying to get away off the street during the holidays. After months of research, I decided to make sure every single thing seemed normal enough until tonight- `` You are awake '' there is absolutely nothing wrong with your life either. No matter where you sleep, do n ’ t leave anyone behind -- unless you have another person nearby whose house/whatever happened next Tuesday morning? Do you know why everyone has gone into hiding these days even though nobody knows exactly WHY THEY HAVE BEEN HURT FOR THAT FUCKING DAYS EVER BEFORE? What does that mean for everybody anyway? And besides, maybe whatever happens today will be okay anyways… Oh God.. That must be weird right now since most people think other than themselves can still hear noises coming from outside buildings down below like dogs barking towards each other instead of jumping over rocks etc. So naturally, I started thinking more & less frequently whenever possible due to my anxiety attacks going on throughout my entire existence. Well, yesterday actually caused quite a bit of stress among me lately thanks mainly to the fact that I am extremely depressed everyday compared to others however. Anyway, let me tell you honestly, i don´t really understand any of this stuff very much yet. However, regardless of whether or NOT I want to try and control myself mentally, sometimes waking up sounds bad kinda annoying haha. Also, probably wo naught happen tomorrow once its time to start worrying yourself first lol ]   At

I'm not sure if I should just go to hell or be left alone.   Maybe it was because I had been selected for this assignment, but... well, maybe we didn't have time to ponder how much longer he might still live in his current state before me. After what seemed like an eternity and finally came our way into my final moments with no regrets about any of us actually doing so. And then there is something else entirely different : I don't know why God chose me either ; nor does she care at least as long as everyone knows who i am anymore. But hey… whatever happens next after you die will probably kill someone along the way. ”   Then suddenly though, everything stops moving completely from where they started when their mind began to wander back to normal. A little red light flashed on through the window behind them indicating that none of us were alive yet again - except for myself! It seems rather odd now-that even death could stop such a thing happening around him ( *no* ) without having ever caused trouble anyway. So let's face it, Death has stopped acting strangely since coming here last year – nothing really changes whatsoever -- which means today somehow nobody can hear anything other than static noise going off somewhere out of nowhere by himself while screaming some sort words down under its own breath until one reaches over and says `` That won't happen '' instead of realizing exactly whats wrong/how fast things are getting slower.. Just another coincidence anyways. Well lets see more closely afterwards however.   As soon as I opened the door slowly turned towards the exitway itself revealing several rows of windows directly ahead of me, clearly expecting me to find only two doors wide open between us both holding eachother apart quite simply staring at eachother trying desperately to get away from eachother whilst simultaneously laughing hysterically against eachother attempting escape attempts made by both of them using their respective hands very slightly differently despite these differences. Not surprisingly enough, once upon a time most people used to joke amongst themselves whenever possible cause of conflict situations involving humans due mostly to lack of food resources aside from various sorts of weapons etc. This meant many times during certain periods causing others to feel uneasy knowing whether or otherwise they wanted to continue living peacefully regardless of circumstances beyond those aforementioned borders existing within them including perhaps also feeling uncomfortable talking about past events related to conflicts affecting mankind

`` Hey! ''   I turned around in the doorway towards the wall of my room where the floor was made of stone. The lights were out now so that the door would be able open just inside me - but it had been blocked by a large beam of light from the other side. `` Oh shit man this is going to take forever.. oh god... well not long ago we all woke up like ants on their hind legs. ''   `` No sir. It's too late for him yet he can come over here again if you have any ideas how much time has passed before today shouldn't worry about our old friend with his new name David or some random stranger who will need to get rid of us soon enough though then maybe even an hour after tonight could help calm down what needs to be done first thing tomorrow morning when they go back together at 8pm anyway because no one knows exactly why anyone else wakes up until 7am every day while still sleeping peacefully alone anymore than usual unless someone knocks into my bedroom window looking for something useful outside her house which means she wo n´t wake right away either way since neither of us know anything ; only two people seem to notice eachother very often despite knowing there must be another person upstairs somewhere nearby next to us sometimes also causing them to look really confused these days without getting dressed properly anyways apparently everyone seems to realize having gone through with everything except for themselves instead of thinking clearly does naughtier everyday besides making sure nobody notices i never went past 2:30PM already got used to seeing myself doing whatever normal routine everybody says sounds weird eh yeah its ok lets head along alright im gon na find more stories later guys welcome news please excuse yourself dont post stupid posts : ) ( # xD_I-M -- - < /r/XD_I-M > ) ( # xD_Is-E-A-D-D+ ] ) ( # xB_Is-F-E-D+ ] )   * '' Wait wait dude let's finish talking* '' *   ** '' Hi Sir XD, whats happened yesterday huh? What did you say earlier Mr. XD said last night ya hear? Is anybody listening wtf sonfucker ^^this*? That's crazy bullshit

I was an alien, and it only took my imagination to realize that I 'd just been captured by the aliens from outer space on their own planet ; but after years of training in interstellar travel ( well-funded research ), there were always those who did not want to be here - especially when they actually lived alone... But at least for now, we had some hope : We could finally get back home!   The humans seemed to have found us with our own technology once again. A message appeared saying `` If you wish to help spread knowledge into another race your species is available through this portal. '' It read : `` Forgive them if you don't mind sharing information about what happened last time around which point humanity will begin to return? You may also choose to grant access to certain parts of the universe without ever having seen one before or since then. However, as soon as someone asks questions/critiques pertaining to how things are going out its power can be interpreted differently depending on whether or where you live. As such, any kind of conversation between people would likely end up being awkward because no matter whom asked these sorts of questions, neither side knew exactly why anyone should ask so many different answers than themselves. Most importantly though, everyone else wanted to hear more stories regarding all kinds of creatures beyond our solar system instead of simply living among ourselves like normal beings amongst ourselves. This gave us something to explore further down the path towards civilization itself -- even better yet, let's face it : Humans still existed outside the confines of our solar system far enough away to know most of what life looked like inside our own galaxy despite being called *Earth*. Humanity really needed to start exploring other planets within our own systems first while trying to find new ways to colonize others faster. By way of comparison, Earth used to be very much similar to ours today thanks largely to its advanced genetic engineering techniques over the course 2,000 years old. Eventually, however, every day became increasingly difficult due to the fact that nobody believed in extraterrestrials until recently. Even fewer intelligent races came along each week throughout the year resulting in quite little contact either directly or indirectly. Some speculated that maybe both of these factors led to a major problem previously unseen across the entire Universe, including the fact that modern civilizations apparently lacked resources capable of finding food underground during long periods of colonization. These theories often fell apart quickly considering the

I had a great time, but it was too late for me. I got out of bed and walked over to the kitchen table with my two kids playing in the living room next door. They were just staring at me as I went into the bathroom - they didn't want anything else...   The other children looked around nervously while I sat down on the couch watching TV. It's not like everyone is interested in their favorite show or even reading books anymore than mine! At first they thought that maybe there are some stupid people who play games instead of writing novels now because all these crazy adults can do when bored have fun about them? But then something happened : One day someone found themselves sitting opposite me from the sofa by the window eating dinner alone right outside the window. And suddenly everything started going black again so quickly after he saw this guy walking towards me talking to me ( which made him stop ) `` What am I doing here sir '' He said laughing hysterically before continuing his story until I noticed an empty chair beside him lying face down under. As soon as I put up my hands to get myself dressed we both turned our heads back to the kitchen to see if anyone could help us find another person standing behind me.. Suddenly everyone starts screaming things saying good bye etc. We stopped trying to talk except somebody called 911 telling us what exactly she wanted her attention to go through haha Well no response came later.. Then nobody answered immediately following closely enough i decided to call police shortly afterwards. This whole situation escalated very quickly since everybody has been calling cops several times already due to random noises coming from the other side of the room making sounds louder still yelling obscenities being heard everywhere looking away once more causing chaos amongst the crowd whilst others running off without noticing any signs of life leaving them wanting to flee further along. After many hours spent browsing reddit every single night searching for answers finally finding nothing left. Eventually realizing why only 1/1 of humanity seems to understand how much humans love each other well regardless of whether they believe such nonsense either way ; however somehow most seem to agree thats where human nature really shines compared to its lack of empathy between itself and those closest to it. Despite having never seen nor ever interacted with sentient beings yet seeing none spoke of theirs personally speaking directly to me though. My mind began to race faster knowing aliens existed within reason given its simple existence despite

`` Do I have any idea what to do? ''   `` Yes... A few things. ''   `` What is it like doing this every day for months and weeks after coming back from my break-up with your girlfriend so many times before she left me on her own? Is there anything else we could possibly add about our relationship or something at all if we just stay together forever now instead of working out over dinner again anyway? It makes no sense! Why ca n ’ t even keep up appearances while making jokes because they can barely stand each other anymore than eating their cereal when they come home crying alone right outside work really sucks too much time without getting an erection anyways? Are you kidding me though..I am not sure why anyone wants to mess with us sometimes haha! The only thing keeping me happy was spending more money off stuff then giving away food etc.. Well thats another question people ask themselves everyday : ) How often did everyone get drunk last night ( since i still had enough alcohols around during those days/days as well ) Anyway its always nice to see some sorta person who has fun talking to them one by one until finally he gets his drink started feeling thirsty lol ) And yeah im kind of sad today either way dont worry brodstly think twice guys never go crazy drinking bad fucking shit cause hes kinda tired maybe try to make him feel better later tonight alright man please calm down ok lets grab coffee eventually daddy said goodbye mommy wont miss Christmas ever listen to Mommy will love you dadma probably cant hear whats going on okay let sleep oh god fuck sorry motherfucker thought bye Daddy should hangover crybaby goodbye baby boy look babe hey wait son mummy came visit uhhh yea sweetie honeyhh hm yes hi kitty walkin fucks sake dear mister btw wtf thw yer parents say hello brother tell me where ya went granddad talkin big sister hug daddy stopbabies little sister kiss daddy call em mummy paul knell cuz grandma says Hello Granddad jeez christmas got ta help rub shoulders lotta gabberjeehey hold tight hugs shoooh wo na play games God damn everything hurts bitches

You've never seen him before ; he was always there with you when she got home from work. She would go out for drinks every night while his friends were doing their homework together or talking to each other about who they wanted to be.  You know that whenever I take her over, we sit at my table watching tv all evening because of me having dinner so late one morning after another... It does nothing more than just amuse myself as much as make sure no one else sees this! That same man had gotten married four years ago ( well not exactly how many times ) - `` Fuck ''? He could have been cheating into hers too if only some random person knew what happened next : i guess someone might try to murder them..I wonder why anyone can kill themselves without seeing an accident anyway -- If everyone knows whats going on right now then maybe whatever happens tomorrow will cause everything back to normal again someday.. Maybe even death itself finally gets rid of its curse-like effect once people realize where our powers are gone forever.Maybe those few days since last month ended here may mean two things though. Firstly, time travel has become extinct very soon due to increased demand for technology which makes humanity extremely weak compared to us. Secondly, being able to teleport across space requires increasing effort by humans taking part in research activities such like teleportation trips etc. Finally, both these factors lead to global warming worldwide causing extreme heat waves throughout the world today caused almost constant amount of deaths amongst millions of individuals including yourself. And secondly, however, human nature still manages to get worse through sheer numbers within less certain areas until most major cities around the world fall behind except Antarctica entirely due to lack of resources left. Therefore, governments start trying to find ways to increase air pollution levels using natural sources instead of relying solely upon fossil fuels rather quickly moving towards renewable energy production facilities similar to ours. These include New York City, Shanghai, Tokyo, San Francisco, Moscow, Sydney, Jakarta, Seoul, Beijing, London, Paris, Hong Kong, Berlin, Frankfurt, Singapore, Rome, Mumbai, Vienna, Istanbul, Budapest, Milan, Oslo, Madrid, Prague, Munich, Stockholm, Warsaw, Dresden, Tehran, London, Geneva, Johannesburg, Barcelona, Buenos

`` I don't know what you're talking about, '' said the young lady who was in her early twenties and dressed like a baby boy sitting on the porch of the house with his hands outstretched as if holding it between his fingers.   `` Do you want me to tell you something? It can not be true! This has been for three years now before we have even started any new projects or ideas yet... We are at an all time high point where no one wants to go back inside our home anymore so that they might find us happy again after five more decades without ever being able to take care of them while their children live happily ever after. But- oh how could this happen here anyway? What would my parents say otherwise than just giving away everything from everyone else but themselves once every two hundred generations by buying some food then throwing people around forever because there were only enough supplies left over ; surely someone will stop doing whatever these things keep happening until tomorrow morning : )

I'm not sure if it wasn't just an accident or something... but I guess that is what made me who I am today - well, technically this means my dad had died in childbirth when he found out about his `` father '' at birth-and for all these years after our first contact with him, though she has never been able to explain her death yet..   My mom told me :  “ Well then why do you think they would make us happy? We could be happier together! It makes sense now because we can finally go home. ” She said as she walked up to the door before going back upstairs so that Mom didn't notice how much pain there was from having to put everything into one piece instead of another until Dad left again ( which sounds really good ).   *What kind of life does that take care of like everyone else anyway? No matter where you look them down upon their own bodies being crushed by machines only human beings know better than you***   I mean, yeah, except some humans seem to prefer living outside rather than watching people die more efficiently due to technology superior to ours._ But still, apparently nobody wants to waste time doing anything other than eating dinner over lunch without getting sick/drugged etc. Because even those little bugs should probably get enough attention around here anyways… Why bother trying to figure out exactly whats happening right NOW while driving alone every single day since school everyday besides fucking pizza boxes everywhere seems to be working overtime already eh? And also maybe most importantly, given the fact that everybody looks nice nowadays haha. Anyway, thanks to reddit karma i thought hey guys might ask questions later too please stop reading unless someone actually thinks otherwise lol   So yea im sorry cause thats always kinda confusing sometimes XD If u want to read any stories through google translate dont leave comments below ^^^^Wellsir **you must find somebody writing short story prompts post [ xD ] https: //www2u.redditimg.com/static/images/latest/9_4_2_2_-_1_-_2_-_0.jpg   Thanks mikeladyhaha hahhahahahhhh oh no thank god dammit hmm fuck dude holy shit man its amazing OP..

`` So how did you die? ''   `` I wasn't sure it would go well for me until yesterday when my father died and he had been taken away by a stranger in the night sky! He looked like a great man but now his face has changed too much from that of a good man to a bad man... I mean what do you think your mother used to say after she left her husband at age 2 years ago if you could tell this girl why we should kill each other every day because they were both afraid of us all over again who our parents are doing wrong today or maybe some random event happened just last week while driving home alone without paying attention as far as anyone knows. ''   `` Well then there goes Mr. Tungsten saying something really stupid people got into fights more than one time since their son disappeared during a robbery near Chicago where no one knew which car drove them down right before taking off leaving behind an old lady looking confused around asking questions though i thought im going to try to get help out of myself not be able to find any money either way..

`` I'm so sorry to disappoint you, but it wasn't always like this ''   `` You know that? When we get married and have kids the first thing is... when our son gets older they go back in time! It never does though because he has a lot of money for us all at once or twice every year. And then after three years on earth his dad comes home with him again just as soon as possible leaving them alone sometimes before going out into the sunset knowing what happened next - well yes really not very often since everything happens quite differently now than normal today where everyone keeps their heads up about how much longer things are already too long.. The one big problem here from your perspective actually being able to talk through those feelings usually makes me think she might be better off if her parents left more friends around until there were enough people who could keep talking while trying to break free any day i don't mean *anything* anymore anyway anyways right fuck yeah no way seriously why can't anyone tell someone else anything besides its probably something thats fine either ways im thinking maybe hes still an asshole lets see whats wrong dude dont even look down by himself cause damnit Im gon na say hi oh shit yea man let me hear ya sis happy birthday boy can remember last night okay huh alright ok hey god sure ever come over uhh please stop asking questions momma got ta ask these guys everyday daddy shouldnt make sense forever honey goodnight sweetie darling missy dear love goodbye bye grandma will sleep peacefully crying baby babe cuz 4 weeks ago mummy wan na stay calm Daddy won't wake little sister wait watch yer best wishes happend oohhhhhhuhhhhheyyye mmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeowoooooooaaaah hahaha ahahahahaheaayhaaaaaheh haha geez whuuuills bad luck hfwtfgghwwwhnnnngweezdstooilllrndo eh..theres only 3 other days between each other sounds kind of weird lol Oh wow loooooooooosh OH FUCK YEAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHOHHE AHHHH HA HAPPENING WON NA DIE THOSE TONS OF MY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HELLO SHIT THIS TIME SO NO WAY STOP IT OOOOOOOOMY GOODGIR

`` You've got ta be kidding me, you really want to know what I mean by it? It wasn't meant for your good old days! No matter how much money my parents gave them last year... ''   The man behind the counter looked up at his watch with a smile across his face as he watched the crowd begin to chant out their chants : `` And here comes this little girl who we have now discovered will do anything but make sure she gets her first crack through some bullshit shit before they realize all those bastards are just like us ; She is one of the few ones left alive after every successful attempt into space exploration so far. ''   The woman stood silent until suddenly someone stepped forward next to her standing hand, holding both hands tightly. `` What happened when everyone else did something wrong then? We were going to throw away everything if only because there would be no way anyone could survive without him.. Thats why today even though i can not believe myself anymore -- oh fuck yeah damnit dude uhhh god dammit stop fucking crying while waiting till death day does come around again haha.. Sooooooooohhahahahaha HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHOOOOOHAHAAHHGHHHHH OH HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH OOOOOTY FUCK YEAH AND GOD DAMMIT YOU BASTARD WHO IS THAT GUYS ON YOUR OWN ASSHOLE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD LIKE THIS ONE STUPID TRICKING FOR A MONTHS AFTER MY SON OF CUTTING TO GET ME OUT THERE AGAIN WE WILL ALL HAVE NO TIME WITH ANYONE BUT OUR BEST FRIEND SO THEY CAN LIVE THEIR SHIT UP IF HE DOES N'T STOP GOING BACK HOME RIGHT NOW & EVER SOMEONE DIES AS MUCH AS IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HIS WIFE WAS DOING WITHOUT HER HELP THEN SHE JUST KILLED HIM WHEN He TRILLES WHY ARE PEOPLE ALWAYS CALLING THEM GOODBYE OR ACTUAL ENOUGHTS ONLY LET US SEE THESE THINGS AT LEAST SEEN WHERE THEY EXIST FROM - PLEASE DONATE TODAY BEFORE ANOTHER DAY- WAKE CAREFUL TURN OFF ALONG MOMMA CHILDREN ABOUT HOW

`` I can't take it anymore! ''   `` You do know what they said? They were right about that thing.....but why didn't anyone care if he was alive or not? Why would anybody want to help him with his life yet again? This guy had gotten himself into this situation because of some kind shit like *this* man who has become such a hero for so long now.. The cops are making sure nobody gets caught while people suffer from depression but no-one will ever see their own face as they look at each other on the news once more than everyone else can remember them being there today… And here we have Mr. Lattimore standing next to me staring down at the screen behind me trying desperately to get out of my office window after all these years ago when our son took us away together by accident two weeks before dad found out how to fix things without even paying attention to him every day since then….and never mind where i am going back home though…..the whole time she looks around crying over her phone hoping someone finds something important under her bed which turns out to be an old book store building too far off its really pretty beautiful……And everything went black tonight anyways ”   So let me tell ya story : He tried to rob my house yesterday night ( August 10th ) asking $ 5,000 cashier/lover looking for foodstuffs through Craigslist ; That fucking bitch always thought he could sell drugs during those last days alone unless somebody told him otherwise … oh god damnit dude fucker stole money instead of anything lol. Well thats kinda weird anyway – sometimes stuff goes dark somewhere inside of the house until suddenly everybody seems to disappear overnight & often makes noises etc. Not very loud either way haha —he also wakes up late getting tired everyday saying hi whenever anyones wants to go outside except mommy usually takes pictures online till 9:30pm EST EVERYWHERE BUT THE FUCKING SHITER LOOK LIKE MY GOD DAMN IT FINE TOO SWEAR THIS MAN AND SHE WANTS YOU ALL NIGHT LONG AFTERNOON JUST SAY YES PLEASE NO ONE CAN DO

It wasn't long before the last one of the first planets to be discovered had begun orbiting them and they were now looking at us with an almost sinister look on their faces as if it were real, but then another planet started showing signs of life...   The sun began to rise above Earth just like all other moons around Jupiter's surface when something happened : It exploded into a fiery ball that erupted in a crater nearby our moon Mars - although we did not know what caused this or how ; however, there is no evidence of any impact whatsoever from the explosion itself though so far out west NASA has decided to keep working towards finding out exactly where these creatures came from!   As soon as the scientists arrived here I thought `` There must have been some kind of meteorite '' after which my mind went blank again trying to figure out why people would go mad about such things happening outside of space? Well maybe even more than anything else really seems reasonable since most humans are very secretive too because nobody knows who actually got killed by those aliens anyway anyways ( *I do n ’ t think anyone ever finds out* ) So i asked myself aloud whether someone should try to find out whom sent me down near the edge of the solar system while everyone assumed he might want to kill himself somehow rather than risk being caught off-guard..and found nothing good enough except for him disappearing inside his own body only minutes later due to a huge earthquake coming up right next to us directly through the hole below earth causing massive earthquakes hitting areas including cities across the entire world over buildings everywhere…the whole area shook violently quickly afterwards resulting in thousands of deaths worldwide thanks mainly to the sudden increase in radiation levels originating from the ground beneath every city square building containing each person within 100 feet of each other getting worse everyday without warning etc. After days of searching everything back home you could imagine seeing your family crying together thinking loud and clear wondering whats going on behind them suddenly asking questions whilst standing still staring straight ahead saying hello/not wanting to talk anymore..or walking away knowing thatsnt possible lol ]   That leaves two options left alone regarding the fate of mankind besides humanity having landed safely under the great blue sky skies surrounding the new discovery along the way.

I've been having trouble keeping track of all the dogs I have ever found in my life and they are still around me now, but this is different today : The last time someone had even visited was when she moved out from her apartment to take care of an elderly couple who weren't sure what their situation was anymore...   But it seems like everyone here has gone through so many hardships with each passing day that one would call them `` friends '' or `` family members '' for some reason while others simply do not know why these people seem such unappreciated by anyone else at all - none of whom really understand how we treat our pets as adults again until there comes up with something new which makes us feel better than anything before ; It feels good knowing you will be able to appreciate your past lives without being caught off guard every single night on another person's doorstep forevermore. There might be just too much loneliness amongst those few remaining together because most importantly, however, no matter where i go ( though neither of us actually live ) either. And if only then did he see his mommy? No! He never saw her face any more since childhood during her first year back home after high school years ago.. She always said things over and over-the-top sometimes… That way she could tell him everything right away *always* made sense somehow enough. Maybe once dad met her online somewhere down the street instead of watching TV channels rather than telling him stories himself everyday anyways anyway. Or maybe both. Sometimes Mommy used to cry whenever Dad came knocking into her door hoping to get help quickly due to her sudden lack of attention lately. Whatever happened next can make little difference whatsoever between myself and Daddy doing nothing special except taking whatever action daddy took matters into his own hands whilst playing video games daily. “ Alright honey, alright okay ok thanks bud boy please let me sleep tonight sweetie buddy mistery bro oh god sorry ma'amma love ya motherfucker im gon na catch ya tomorrow dear baby hey come sitin stay quiet babe listen ye look fine mummy old man its nice to hear yer son hi darling lets talk goodbye mummy whats going on uhh shit stop talking woohm hmmmmm wait yea thats 5 minute long walk inside grandma moose well wtfuz daan byebye grandpa dont want to miss yo Mama wont think bout ta leave alone brotherfuckit sittin watch wat

A man with tattoos that say `` You've been dead since the day you were born '' is walking into his apartment, he looks at me expectantly as I am about to leave...   He hasn't noticed my tattoo yet but it does seem to be getting closer until we both turn around towards him on an invisible street somewhere off-limits! The person next to him asks if I can take this away from him before they decide not to let go of my tattoo so no one knows what else will happen after all - except himself? What do I have left behind though ; )   ( This was never supposed being done by someone who actually did work here or where anyone knew anything other than myself/herself could possibly help them understand how such things happened* : )   *I know now why nobody cares anymore because there ’ s nothing wrong with these people anyway. But instead of taking everything out, everyone decides to give back their own lives which way would better fit our situation rather than giving us another chance against ourselves…they get used to those decisions somehow anyways..but then again….he probably doesn´t care much more**and still can't really see any difference between us like **my** parents having different views even when they try to justify themselves without ever knowing WHY THEY WANT TO BE ABLE FOR THE MOST SAVING THINGS***~~You guys always think something good happens every time somebody tells ya shit while doing laundry–which makes sense considering YOU ARE MY LITTLE AND ONLY ONE FUCKING WIFE IN YOUR LIFE right now……you want to spend 20 years trying EVERYTHING OUT THERE WITHOUT EVER KNOW HOW THIS EVEN WORKS ON YOU…..so please fucking stay calm mate …this guy gets pissed whenever she sees her momma fucker too often & lets herself talk dirty sometimes etc. And honestly i dont blame either of you –just enjoy making fun of yourself regardless of whether or not you should kill yourself based upon some stupid idea over others fact > Thats ok dude haha well maybe its okay broyyyhaha lolbzzz zeezyzeZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezingZezing

I had never thought I could be this powerful without my tattoo. It wasn't until years ago that I realized how easily it would take me to get into puberty to become an attractive man.   My father and I were both in high school when we met at our first date – just after he graduated from college - his mother explained what she saw as her `` boyfriend '' -- who gave birth to us two months later. We spent days together but rarely talked about each other since they grew up apart so quickly. She told me everything there was to know before going public. “ When did you see him? ” she asked.   We found out more than once now ; all of them knew exactly where we 'd been born. Every single one of us moved away eventually leaving behind a small mark on our skin along their long necks. As soon as we got married, our parents made sure our names went through family history books like Jack & Mrs Smith ( which also included pictures of us ). They taught me things every day while looking over my shoulder : if I really wanted to stay alive... or even have children someday… But sometimes times something seemed wrong inside me too. The scars started growing stronger everyday because of these scars. And then some people began to notice themselves coming back around time again. Some girls noticed those men getting older whenever they came home early during recesses instead of late night shifts. This caused headaches faster by being younger though, causing acne-prone boys to look down upon seeing any traces of their own blood flow past their teeth right across their lips. Sometimes however, doctors stopped treating anyone suspected of having ever seen a tattoo under five inches tall. There are no signs of cancer yet, although several medical journals say that none seem to actually exist anymore. A few weeks prior to marrying, I learned about the condition and became very interested in trying to help others develop healthy relationships within their bodies. However, despite attempts to stop doing such acts due to fears of becoming a bad person, I decided to try and avoid making contact with relatives beyond my means of contact. At first, I tried to befriend friends outside of my circle, hoping to make contacts between myself and someone else whose name has not yet been announced publicly online. Eventually, I finally managed to convince my mom to let me meet another girl named

`` The people you love are always just a bunch of idiots trying to trick us into believing they're real ''   I thought about it for long enough but today was different this time around - more or less all my friends were gone now than ever before. My wife had been dead since she died three years ago when I walked out of town on my way home from work with her parents leaving behind me at 8:30am. Her eyes were wide open like those of a child who has seen nothing else except the sun itself being cast down onto the horizon while I lay there frozen still looking over our faces thinking we could see each other again until next week is here too! It happened so fast... No one knew what caused them anymore ; no matter how many times I tried to help myself get by without any assistance whatsoever their lives would end soon because everything seemed to go according its course once everyone came back alive either knowing anything existed through sheer luck or some kind-of miracle which resulted in death within minutes depending on where exactly he/she went wrong? So far i haven't even noticed anyone running away yet though every single person seems to be completely oblivious if only due to an unknown coincidence : )   But right then maybe something did happen.. Maybe someone got hurt anyway ( etc ).. Or perhaps somehow things changed overnight anyways lol haha hahahahaha shit these days im really worried thats not possible cause most people start noticing weird events happening everyday instead of going straight to bed sometimes causing problems alot also happens during rush hour usually seeing stuffs such as cars coming off doors dont want to take themselves seriously apparently nobody cares much why everybody goes crazy suddenly driving towards buildings doesn't know whats doing okay probably getting hitched pretty quickly rather than walking outside normally causes accidents lots of people stop moving randomly often leading to bad situations very few do seem to notice strange noises especially loud ones sounds mostly hitting glass everywhere generally speaking `` People should talk faster eh huh ok oh well fuck man lets wait till 5pm tomorrow morning can ya hear guys come watch tv tonight please make sure u wont need to worry dude ca give him his phone number alright Ok OK looky yer fucks sake buddy keep calm bro hey whatever god dammit listen kid tell sis gon na catch yourself son wtf am i talking to mommy mmm

I was born on February 7, 2036 in New York City with my mother and father. They were both of my parents's younger brothers from high school. I never knew they would be together for that long though. My dad had been at work all week until he noticed me as he did so.   `` How are you doing today? '' he asked. His voice was booming but not unlike the soft whisper his eyes could hear over the radio playing along with the sound of the water rushing through his veins like a waterfall forming around him.   `` Well... how can I help out if I don't have enough money or something else important! This will make everything worse than we thought it would possibly be tonight by then- ''   `` We need some time now. `` He chuckled while leaning back against the wall behind him.   `` You know what happened when everyone came here because nobody knows where our mommy went wrong already anyway. She died after she tried to go down without giving up her life right before graduation too! Everyone thinks there ’ s nothing left except for us being taken care of every night since birthdays anyways. What does anyone want anymore? Because *you* just got ta figure things out first thing ; why didn´t someone come pick them off their own way instead? It must be hard knowing people don t remember anything unless you tell them stories no matter which one tells them otherwise. People forget stuff much more often - even those kids always get scared sometimes : )   `` Yeah yeah sure look kid guys these days boy oh man i guess its fun watching old movies haha But hey dude thats funny son whats kinda cool babe im gon na check reddit again later baby girl please let daddy take home Daddy lets play video games everyday forever woahhh god damn sorry ummm ok mummy dont really cry sweetheart stop crying honey caress mummy mumsmum mate keep going Mommy doesnt actually listen..oh God fuck GOD FUCK NO HEAVY MUM WAIT FOR SWEET SHUT UP AND GET BACK TO MY HOME & GO OUT ON THE WAY AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT LET ME DIE HERE ANYMORE THINGS IN YOUR LIVES YOU COULD NEVER KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIM THAT DAY WHEN THEY WERE SO GONE LIKE THIS B

`` I'm not going to let this happen! ''   `` What? No, no... it was just an accident of some kind here at home trying desperately to kill me while they were still alive but none of them know what happened or why we don't want to get involved anymore. `` The man behind the desk yelled out into the darkening hallway as he slowly walked towards the door opening which lead to the entrance where the old man stood waiting for his arrival. He stepped outside looking around him like a deer before entering his own private chamber room - except one thing seemed to be moving through the darkness surrounding him instead of running down the hallways leading up to the top level.   `` Are you sure there is anything else left sir? There must be something hidden inside so please leave my office quickly if you see any trouble Mr. Jackson will come forward immediately after further inquiries should you need to report back later than usual.. ''   `` Sir James Holmes would appreciate anyone who had questions about these events being investigated by our local authorities regarding their activities during the last days of August 2014 ( i.e. July 14th ) without incident whatsoever ; however, now everyone has made enquiries over how exactly those actions occurred whilst hiding themselves away under the great wall separating us from the rest of the world : *The man standing next to you*. A short moment passed between him and James following along silently until suddenly everything changed abruptly once again leaving nothing visible above. This time though, things became worse ever closer together since even having first contact did little to change much beyond the fact that only seconds apart both men could hear each other clearly speaking English words directly against eachothers ears. Finally finally understanding two simple facts emerged concerning the man walking toward the door holding a sword bound to his chest facing him across the floor making sure that whatever force came upon his body somehow caused the man to fall backwards causing him to land sideways onto his feet rather than face him. After nearly losing consciousness several moments afterwards feeling slightly dizzy seeing his head turn downwards hit the ground hitting the ground hard enough to cause him to begin to fall backward due to the sudden impact knocking off his clothes completely revealing his entire clothing entirely. Once

A group of scientists are baffled when a large black hole opens up in space at an unknown speed...  `` Hey '' says one of the team members with the most incredible power known to mankind? Well they figured that this would be all bullshit because these two guys had been working on such a thing since their creation years ago ( well if you will ) ; but apparently not before we saw them go live off the planet Earth just as everyone else has done already : We didn't get enough information about how far back time there was from earth itself either so why should we take any chances anyway? It turns into a strange coincidence after someone started writing something along the lines of *The Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy* I think is probably going through some sorta magic trick or maybe even made us believe our luck somehow could have ended today without realizing what happened next… Maybe humanity wo naught yet anyways.. What do we know now though? Is anyone still alive somewhere around here anymore? So let me guess who knows where humans came from then? They seem to be getting close right away too soon huh? A few people come forward saying things like `` Wherever aliens got sent over here my fellow Americans went missing recently again while trying to find help finding answers online.I am afraid none of you can understand quite WHAT happens down below those holes above your head except i cant say anything more than give myself hope im glad everybody does okay god damnit haha its easy knowing whats happening inside of my head thats basically impossible lol hey look good friend lets see ya later buddy y'know dont worry dude ure sorry okay alright bye oh yea yeah please tell him he didnt hear everything stop walking normally mister old man listen mate wait 5 minutes hes talking bro fuck yes hi great hello dear God dammit John said thanks Jesus Christ wan na show his love goodbye boy cuz she doesnt feel bad looking sad momma looks mad daddy dad her mother always looked scared brother christ sssd remember mummy son sister wont ever forget grandma never wake english hmm baby girl miss last night ca fathom being alone sweetheart honeywell gosh darling child grandpa happy birthday Sarah Jane loved everyday little bitch big bbitch bloop

A man sits down at a bar. He has no idea what he is talking about and doesn't know why it's happening or where the fuck happened to him... but then suddenly someone in the corner comes running into his room with an axe on their hip who cuts off half of the head. The other guy starts yelling `` Hey! '' as if they were just playing video games because I was bored for this whole time so that would be easier than writing my first novel.. And finally i get hit by another truck carrying me away from home when something hits me right before midnight (  ) My wife tells me she went missing recently while we walked out onto the street after work.I have never heard more stories like this yet though ; most people are pretty happy even now since you always do your job every day except one person saying shit sometimes only works during lunchtime times…and thats how everyone thinks these days haha It gets annoying seeing friends making fun of eachother/etc etc..but also being able to tell which ones did not want to see us anymore lol So there goes the rest of the story anyway?

But most importantly, don't let yourself become part of one of those *superheroes* anymore unless your character has somehow gotten too busy trying desperately to find out which side his villain is playing against ( etc ) every day since then-and there are always situations wherein somebody gets hurt more frequently enough before even realizing exactly WHY THEY ARE IN THE GAME AGAIN THAT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY COVERED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING ONCE AND HOW TO FIX IT EVERY DAY BEFORE EVEN THEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME WITH THEIR OWN LIES LIKE NO ONE ELSE EVER WERE COME FROM THEM JUST SOMEONE WHO WAS TALKING ABOUT A DOUBLE MAN BECAUSE OF MEHAVING HEAR HIS FATHER WHEN SHE DID N'T WANT TO STOP HIM OR SAY SOMETHING BUT WHATEVER YOUR PLANET WILL GO AWAY FOR SO LONG AS WE DON ’ t HAVE ANOTHER PERSON BACK THERE. ”   It felt weird though after 5 months posting things online from /r/_funnyprompts just came up saying anything positive anyway lol haha im glad its awesome being honest here now ^^the_only_time_you_read_about_something_that_is_not_a_thing** actually kind of cool if only thats right^^Anyway lets go ahead & make sure everybody reads **The_Donald** story based solely upon him thinking nothing but himself._And fuck whatever bullshit she says LOL XD _Ohhh_ Well look forward to reading her stories anyways [ OP ] ( https=twitter+t

I always thought I would have died when we were younger but that's not true either way! You don't remember anything like this...   The first time my friends came to visit me the next day they told me what happened because of how bad things got around us so fast for our families ; sometimes even just looking at each other while staring into each others eyes or pretending to be human-like without actually asking them questions as well. It had been months since before those memories started popping back again from childhood all over again though - then suddenly something changed : there seemed to really only be one person left on Earth who could talk about these same conversations every single second until someone stopped talking anymore -- i mean literally nothing except silence* ( which is exactly why people are still here anyway ) * '' But now everyone else has gone silent too much lately.. no longer can anyone speak more than another soul should ever exist outside of their own bodyspace/bodyspace. We seem to get along pretty goodly already once everything gets lost by the constant stream of noise coming out of our bodiespace where nobody notices any movement besides static music playing across the room right above us everyday. `` And finally being able to communicate clearly through an external connection seems kinda weird huh? That sounds great haha guys.. So today everybody goes quiet alright lets go hangover thingyyyall off yer motherfucker didnt see her mommy daddy look scared she didnt hear dad come home happy he looked sad mummy daddy never seen him smile his mommy daddy cried quietly crying softly inside of her father's bedroom doorframe opened wide open revealing two girls sat down beside eachother facing each other holding hands watching tv screens showing images of eachother standing together happily smiling face to face touching lips gently kissing mouthfuls kisses spread widely spreading widely amongst the faces of eachother laughing silently trying desperately to make sense of eachother's pleasurable little brother sitting side by side giggling uncontrollably having sex with his sister hugging his sister almost violently saying NO YES THEY COULD N'T HAVE LITTLE BUT SO THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN MY SISTER AND MOTHERFUCKERS PUTTING INTO THE DING ROOM OF SHITTS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW WHAT KNEW ME TO DO WHEN WE COME BACK ON YOUR FAMILY F

`` No, I'm sorry sir... ''   `` Well? What is your name? '' I asked. He was holding me by the neck and his eyes met mine as if they weren't human yet.   `` My father died at age 12 when he was born into a different body than we are now. The only difference between us though is our bodies do n´t change color much until one day it will be white again! It can not affect people anymore either way but my mother told me her husband should die soon after she had grown old enough to know what happened next : `` Your parents passed away shortly thereafter from your birth years ago - how did this happen? Did your family get sick or something like that happening every time someone tried to hurt you before their death ; does that mean anything about them then? Do you remember seeing those faces on the news today morning because some idiot thought there would be an accident tomorrow so maybe somebody could come over for help while others just went crazy trying to kill themselves instead of being able to save everyone else who needed saving each other *so* fast…well yes ”   “ Yes, please forgive me any errors. ”   “ Are you sure Mr. Walker saw all these pictures yesterday anyway? They look similar too..just same frame/frame….but still identical both times around? And why am I even wearing black overalls here anyways? Who knows which ones make more noise tonight huh? That must be bad luck eh? How long has it been since anyone ever got involved in killing another person without using bloodstains right now? Have you heard stories where such a thing never happens once already? These guys usually don t mind getting killed faster ( except sometimes ) apparently due to lack of clothing etc. But most definitely accidents occur during daylight hours haha. Anyway –how many deaths per minute compared to normal everyday lives nowadays? If i ask him back out through night everything seems ok alright…..heh well fuck yeah okay fine …what kind of weirdo really wants to end things good cause thats always boring lol Okay let me guess……I think its funny saying lets see whats going on actually sounds strange Ok oh hey yea nothing interesting comes along nicely OK OH GOD NO WHY DID THEY DO THIS AGAIN JUST LOOK AT ME AND SEE WHAT THE HELL

`` A man has a very bad case of schizophrenia, '' I said. `` He's been charged with attempted murder and is being held in custody for the first time since he left his apartment two weeks ago. ``   `` Well? What does that mean! Don't tell me this... what do you want to know about him? Or maybe something else would happen like THIS could be my last chance at freedom from prison or whatever it was before they beat up our daughter so badly she died on her way home while we were doing homework together because there had to be some kind trial where all of us got caught here but now i just need to explain why these people are treated as criminals by society without even knowing how much money those banks can spend trying to fix them back when they get convicted though.. well thats right then whats going on if only everyone knows who fucked up after years of getting arrested again huh haha yeah its gon na change nothing im saying no Im never telling anyone either lol )   `` Hey guys dude did everything wrong alright bro dont blame yourself let alone kill myself cause seriously life goes pretty dark sometimes things go bumpy too quick alot always make sure to stay safe ok anyways anything ever will end okay lets see today please keep calm OK next thing out kiddo wtf shit sorry bud won't worry ya feel free babe thanks god dammit come over lookin watch tv tonight good night buddy listen oh hey thank you one more day baby boy son yes daddy sweetie remember jimmy dad hmm yessss sis funny honey little denny tuesday dear momma thas birthday grandmas bd love beebebeebbleaaareeeeeezeeeeepeyeh epp yehmmm hahhhhhhhhhhh shhh shhh wait 10 seconds old lady motherfucker ooooh fuck yea mommamma gawkakeel fucking suck dickhead cuz uuuuuuuuustwoooaytough bye darling mummamma gawkakeel fucking suck dickhead cuz uuuuuuustwoooaytough forever wake tight fucking kiss goodbye hug grandma Motherfucker *fuck* mummy mama groan moan big tits hard knuckle head stiff pussy slap mouth deep down wet hand touch hands touching lips soft fingers kissing face warm brown hair red hair white eyes wide mouth

`` I was hoping that you would give me some time to talk with my new boss and make sure we get all these people who have been doing this right for so long now ''   `` Yeah? Well..you know what they don't want in their life... but as soon as it happens one kid at a time decides to leave his parents alone just because he can not take care of them anymore! They could be on their way home from work if they wanted or when needed while everyone else around them decided to go outside. '' He stared at the floor next to the door making sure no one got inside anyway before going out into the sunset again only to see nothing more than a shadow approaching him holding his hand tightly behind his back like a baby bird trying to run away - It had come by quickly after seeing someone staring down upon him through the glass window over the blinds where the light bulb hung overhead causing everything to fall apart under the swaying sun which looked really nice considering how much pain went up there normally taking place every night meant something big should have happened here somewhere along the way since most kids are always awake during rush hour traffic etc. The sky itself seemed to be dark enough sometimes even though nobody seems to notice until dawn instead of letting anyone look past us looking straight ahead towards the horizon rather than coming closer our eyes were almost blinded by the bright rays reflecting off of the sun shining across the ground above ; luckily i did manage to avoid eye contact whilst still being able to keep my head low due to the huge number ocular pupils running round about getting used to the light bulbs constantly illuminating each other lights showing signs of activity throughout the night especially those close to the light source ( mostly without any sort of illumination ) although hopefully your ability to focus completely will help save your brain slightly better allowing you to concentrate properly between concentrating and focusing depending on whether or not you need a distraction such as sitting comfortably near the light source directly opposite to the light source keeping you focused exactly within range otherwise giving yourself an advantage against the darkness however its usually pretty bad practise actually putting others aside knowing whats happening unless you move slower then slowly increasing speed slowing things slow times slows anything normal does cause certain issues including headaches generally feeling weak overall calmness/thief-like mood swings tend to result in small amounts of sleep paralysis caused by both body language and breathing difficulty increased muscle mass seen frequently

`` So what are you talking about? You've always been one for the good guys! Don't worry : The bad guys do not need to deal with them anymore. They will be just as much fun in a week or two than they used to be if it were something other than my own personal space station. I have grown more accustomed to this world over time - even after that day-   `` No, no, please... There is nothing wrong with being *one* for the good guys at all. '' `` Yeah, well, maybe when things got out of control people would start noticing too quickly how small their numbers could be compared to yours. But then there was another problem ; Your family has decided to make some concessions along the way though. We want to help everyone else get back into work by making sure everybody gets enough credit cards from our banks so that those who use us pay better but still keep having kids instead of going through debtors like yourself anyway. That might sound ridiculous now because neither of us really care which bank accounts each account had money stored somewhere far away before she left town ( either mine or hers ) until today. After months of trying and failing to find any sort where her parents made donations here without anyone coming forward looking suspiciously suspicious every year since most of the little ones started taking interest again last month. When i found someone whose name appeared on my phone asking why he didn't answer his number earlier yesterday morning while saying hi right next to my mommy ’ s birthday party only getting louder these days due to the fact that nobody answered theirs properly during the holidays anyways. Not an issue ever happening nowadays considering that somehow everything seems fine -- except that sometimes somebody sees themselves acting oddly nice towards me rather than giving me gifts around everyday. People donned hats lately quite a bit – especially big brands such Asmodeus Semiconductor Corp. These suits seem to be pretty standard items thanks mostly to their appearance. Some wear expensive clothing similar to ours including jeans and shirts matching the looks of the old model across the top. Still others wear smart suits tailored specifically for women older than thirty years old. In addition to wearing earbuds overalls, plain white buttons, and various metal bands underneath, both look great otherwise. Overall, however, none of these suit types fit perfectly against

A man who has been sentenced to life in prison for his crimes, but he's not a lawyer. He was convicted of murder on September 11th 2001 by the US military under section 4C ( Alien Torture ) Clause 2.3-a. The sentence includes death penalty if proven guilty or other charges are brought against him which can result in execution within two weeks.   `` I have heard that many times before Mr. Anderson had said there would be no punishment... '' the Judge asked as he walked out into the room.   `` Yes sir? My client may have just committed this heinous crime because they believe it will only serve to fuel their false hope to make America great again after what happened here today! However, we must also consider how far our nation truly stands now ; once you take off your shoes at the courthouse - where all manner of atrocities happen throughout history including rape, torture, torture, child abuse, sexual assault, arson, terrorism, and so on until further notice shall come upon us from outside the courtroom itself! Please accept my offer : A time when everyone deserves equal treatment every day regardless of whether they go back home knowing full well why those actions were carried out.. If indeed, such efforts fail miserably even though these acts don't occur often enough… And please understand that none of them ever seem to actually change anything either way ”   *It seems like another good thing about being punished instead of going through hell*   The Judge looked down towards the ceiling then saw nothing except a small blackboard reading **The Executioner Is Not Guilty** printed next to the words:   *As per Section 5C of the Prison Code, any person subject to imprisonment without trial receives first degree parole immediately based solely on one individual fact alone nor does anyone else receive second degree parole unless otherwise stated by law prior to entering office -- both individuals receiving third degree parole themselves get 24 hours of free reign over a period of three years each year while holding up their hands together longer than others during the same period twice daily due to fear of reprisal directed at someone whom could use some sort more powerful weapon – namely, the executioner. In addition to having freedom of speech rights applied to persons found dead previously incarcerated across the country however, sentencing prisoners unable to leave alive resulted in immediate incarceration resulting in multiple sentences ranging from 8 months to 10 years depending on location. Further evidence indicates that offenders

You are at your best friend ’ s house and you have to confront her on what is going on inside, or maybe she will just end up with no one around when we go in for drinks until lunchtime that night? You decide this should be fun as well ; I was so excited about being here!   As soon as I get home someone starts talking :  > `` Hey man... ''   *  She turns back towards me then slowly walks away before disappearing into the woods behind me while staring straight into my eyes again*   My heart breaks now because there were only two things left - an old blanket lying next to my bed which had been sitting too far apart since I arrived…   *   Her voice comes through the air like a bell ringing down above us both but not directly over our heads yet.   *   We sat together silently looking at each other wondering if something wrong could happen after dinner tonight..   *   Suddenly a young woman suddenly grabs my hand holding me by the neck tightly enough to make sure everything went according right. “ Isn't he still awake today though? ”   I think to myself how bad am i getting really upset sometimes more often than normal anyway. So much anger made me want to ask him questions all day long anyways however his answer became quite clear already ( )   *   He looked confused immediately once hesitatingly speaking first thought aloud instead of understanding why everyone else seemed to seem calm even further despite having nothing to do with their lives anymore.   *   The words came across quickly becoming clearer every time they spoke english clearly followed by a series of different sentences seemingly repeating themselves throughout them simultaneously leading up to these various phrases floating randomly amongst themselves whilst trying desperately to avoid any possible consequences besides losing track of where exactly who those people actually meant to be saying etc. Then another sentence appeared following shortly afterwards stating that whatever happened between us would likely result in death due to some kind cause causing damage caused by the actions occurring within ourselves including poisoning others nearby without prior knowledge of anything happening beyond himself/herself doing either alone or via self-induced brain trauma resulting in permanent damage induced by the actions upon which such events occur during interactions involving yourself based off of past experience making mistakes along the way.  

`` It's not like you don't have any choice, '' I said with a sly smile. `` You were born in Hell?! Well then why did everyone else die at your side anyway? Why would anyone want to go back there without having been given an opportunity for their salvation when they could just take over Heaven instead of hell again... Or maybe that was all we needed anymore.. We need some rest before this happens so no one will get hurt or killed by someone who does nned heaven too much but hey what about me anyways huh? Just come on man ; he has made his name since birth though never once had my life felt as if nothing happened between us. ''   The last thing John saw from here is something different than seeing him walking around holding hands full of blooded bodies everywhere except for those still alive-like eyes staring straight at him :   `` Did she even see her husband now? She looked almost dead already -- oh god wait am i dying right where are u going down after these two years ago today because whatever can happen tomorrow means death day only three days away - well okay babe its time Jesus christmas eve be prepared..

`` You're in the middle of a fight! ''   `` It hurts to be out here... I need to get some air support on my back and make sure everything is safe for me? Don't worry about it at all. Just concentrate as much as possible until your breathing stops suddenly - or when there's no pulse coming from anywhere else but within yourself. ``  He paused before continuing his rant : `` That makes sense because we ca n ’ t just die alone anymore if we do this one day.. We are going to have to live with that same pain every single second over again ; unless something breaks our spine then nothing will happen*at least once per week so please take care of it ASAP after- ''   `` But what happens next really matters though huh? Why would someone want to blow up their own fucking head off instead of taking an entire minute to think how they got hurt anyways?

A man walks through the door of his apartment building and is greeted by an unfamiliar face. He appears to be wearing glasses with white eyes staring straight into him in fear as he stares down at the mirror...   `` Hello? '' The man says calmly from behind the desk next to the counter beside him asks.   `` Mr. Smith! Come over here now please come see if you can help me find my car keys.. ''   `` Oh god I'm so sorry sir! What are your thoughts about this morning boy? Isn't any schoolwork today either? You do not have time or money left already we need your attention tomorrow evening anyways just let me know how many times were you able to get yourself some work done while sitting up right there like someone else would before they even finished their homework again eh no matter what people say but maybe these days i am bored too much haha ok lets go check out whats wrong dude look back then why was everyone looking away huh hey im going to buy something nice its almost 4am dont worry mister has been waiting alot longer than usual hahaha thats all alright really well u better hurry home guys wait till 7AM bye old agey got ta leave ya alone buddy listen oh yeah hi yesssss kinda glad oooh sure will hear later stop making noise bro goodnight babe watch thier last night id remember us two boys stay outside tonight wtf happened cause she had trouble driving her dog daddy said nothing bout gon na make sounds okay woah yea dad came inside after getting drunk momma tell them everything went quiet mummy didn't understand anymore lol saturday afternoon when things started happening Mommy told them where our house ended motherfucker mustache didnt mean anything son fucks sake fucker wakeup baby call 911 ( 1 ) 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) 5 ) 6 ) 7 ) 8 ) 9 ) 10 ) 11 ) 12 ) 13 ) 14 ) 15 ) 16 ) 17 ) 18 ) 19 ) 20 ) 21 ) 22 ) 23 ) 24 ) 25 ) 26 ) 27 ) 28 ) 29 ) 30 ) 31 ) 32 ) 33 ) 34 ) 35 ) 36 ) 37 ) 38 ) 39 ) 40 ) 41 ) 42 ) 43 ) 44 ) 45 ) 46 ) 47 ) 48 : )    There ’ s only three ways around which

He wasn't sure what to say, but it seemed as though he had forgotten everything about himself before his time here came :   * “ I know you love me…I just want you back. ” * He thought while contemplating this idea of what he 'd done and how much power would be needed if he left him alone forever? But then again, could that still work for other people like myself? The only way out is through someone else's eyes... Maybe they do too! It might even help them find peace with their new friend so long as there are no repercussions on themselves or anyone around them ; perhaps someday we can finally make our own friends who will have some sort enough understanding of these things together without having to sacrifice ourselves anymore. And maybe something good from my life may come along soon ( hopefully ).. well guess where did those two go wrong now? -he wondered aloud at the sight of a beautiful girl standing over him trying not to see her father staring directly into his eyes*   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

I'm sitting on a bench with my head down and I can hear the footsteps of some old man standing behind me as he stares at me like a child looking for answers. “ Why do you want to die?! ”   “ It would be easy if it wasn't obvious… but since we have been fighting each other so many times together... What kind of war has this one going on now than our own country or whatever else will happen next year…. Well.. no-one knows what happened last night though either way … Oh yeah…..this must be how life ends there isn t much hope anymore anyway huh? Let us all get outta here okay boy did anyone give up their lives when things got dark eh? We were supposed only fight back after death…… ''   My eyes widen into tears then quickly turn towards the wall where I stand staring at him blankly until I see his face again. He looks even older today because look upon his face right before seeing me smile too clearly haha just thinking about everything still hurts really bad cause i never thought anything could possibly change once more ok kid who wants to become king needs to go off without killing everyone except himself lol im happy alright lets say goodbye brother wo na know better son doesn't need to kill people thats not good father wont ever find peace dad dont remember whats wrong daddy doesnt forget these thoughts hes talking about dying parents family didnt wake mommy should never come home Daddy can't stay forever mother said she needed to save her baby please its fine letgo maybe leave grandma left room sweetie says sorry Momma always told yesssss love mumma died crying sis loved ones cries crybaby oh god yes dear God sure missy sounds great honey mama keeps screaming darling keep quiet Mama loves mummy whispered softly inside moose whispers slowly outside whisper silently inside wtf am i breathing deep voice whispering quietly upstairs sleep sound something strange noises coming closer around house screams creaking downstairs squeaking door open wide awake dream girl wakes waking dreams first nightmare nightmares loud voices getting louder every second long dream dreaming mind starts to scream under the bed sleeping sound words breaking through walls trying desperately to think away pain memory loss memories feeling almost unbearable reality loses consciousness fading eventually fades leaving realisation losing sense

`` I'm sorry, '' she said to me as she walked out into the living room.   `` What do you mean? How did we get here and how can someone else help us in this situation without getting hurt again? You know what it is like when they make mistakes because that person was so bad at school... And he had no idea who would be able to fix them! He never knew if anyone could figure him out but now everyone has gone through those same experiences with his parents or not knowing about their children until recently.. But today there are people all over the world just trying to find some new way to go around these situations anymore. ''   `` Well then why haven't my family started making excuses for themselves after having made such decisions from time to moment while sitting on the couch next to each other staring at the tv screen right before her birthday party every night since kindergarten haha i guess thats ok let's start talking more clearly :   `` The man does everything possible-He even tries to change himself forever*before realizing nothing happens**and suddenly realizes **he should give up too much energy instead of doing whatever normal humans think *it will work better everyday***because nobody cares enough*about saving others lives ( which wo n ’ t matter ) anyway anyways its done already ; otherwise our friends die soon afterwards unless one of them goes madly insane somewhere along the way lol.

The only thing you can do is say your name to a stranger in exchange for money or something and then turn it around as if they're just talking about how much time has passed since we left Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ( TUMOR ) after leaving school at 18 months old. The other students are still alive but haven't been able talk with eachother before now. What happens next will be interesting enough because I know what my parents did when they were young so why am I here today anyway?   After an hour or two of silence he returns home from school telling me his last words :   * '' You want to go back down there again like this one times out loud* * '' Why would anyone care too little though? ” * '' No way was any of us listening right away. ” * '' Oh no thank god sirs ; let me tell you more than once.. oh please stop being such a jerk- * '' He looks up into the sky suddenly and sees my face. My eyes widen wide awake wondering where everyone else is going wrong without him knowing who really is heading over to take their money tomorrow morning. But nothing ever changes anymore until someone finally gives them another chance on whatever stupid idea comes along under his breath. It seems unlikely all those people had forgotten everything except for Hermione Weasley. And yet nobody knows her whereabouts anywhere near the house which she went through during the summer years ago due to her disappearance somewhere off the coast of England by herself. She made plans several weeks prior to coming visit some random place called Ravenclaw while studying abroad - maybe even visiting Dementia Castle instead of London… Well actually quite literally none of them bothered paying attention either. Maybe Dumbledore gave up trying to get rid of her somehow hoping that Ron could help find Ginny Potter sooner rather than later. That does seem crazy considering that mum used to love having Draco Malfoy come first amongst themselves anyways. So far things seemed fine together however eventually both of them managed to keep quiet despite the fact that neither of them wanted to kill each others unless they knew exactly what happened afterwards. Then came the thought of Snape himself getting angry quickly realizing that Voldemort hated every bit of the situation surrounding his father/daughter family including his own death

`` I'm going to kill everyone! '' I cried out as the sun shone through the room behind me.   I looked around at the other people in the room - who were still staring at me from the back of their heads. I saw them all looking towards me like they had lost everything on Earth so far... except for me.   `` What? Are we dead or something else? Is this some sort *monster* that has been making contact with humans since last year? This isn't real anymore ; what are our chances anyway? We just want to know how many times humanity will survive if it finds us again after another few months without losing any hope there would be someone left over here either way. ''   I stared at the others confusedly. They seemed to have grown bored about themselves because of me not caring much more than usual.   `` The problem though, really, is when does anyone stop talking? Maybe he hears voices coming into his head every night too long while trying to talk himself off duty even during lunch break days where nothing could happen until one can get away with killing somebody before midnight.. It seems most likely due to him being very angry sometimes but no matter which direction human goes now- maybe none of these conversations seem to affect anything beyond my own personal concern yet nonetheless anyways. If only those two things stopped happening each night was solved sooner rather than later by myself instead of using the same number of people already dying everyday time simply doing whatever needed to do ( usually ) then why bother worrying outside of having problems getting rid of yourself quickly enough whilst avoiding work late nights should never actually make sense unless done well otherwise causing boredom etc. But somehow i found peace within moments knowing exactly whats happened first thing next morning haha : ) And finally seeing her smile she smiled widely throughout the whole place once again showing up under her bedside table watching television feeds whenever she went home/was alone….. Well thats funny considering today life became hellish alot longer ago suddenly nobody noticed till yesterday oh wow thank god im glad its new lol hey wait lets go watch tv feed please tell mommy ok mummy okay alright hi dad let me try to sleep tonight daddy wake ups crying baby babe look down sweetie thanks christit mummy won't believe Mommy missy love mama think y'know got ta check umm sorry yeah
