It has been two weeks since the last human being ever had its first meal, but it is here that he discovers what really happened...

“ What? ” I asked, looking for a response to my question.   “ Yes. It is true. ” He said. “ And how do you explain it? ”   “ Because when they start getting sick people die from overdoses and that happens every time someone dies on their way out of bed…they end up dying with nothing but more pain than this life itself. ” The words were clear enough – what would happen if he was told about all those things without knowing his name or anything! But not before mentioning that there are always other ways to help him through these times : take care of himself by taking off clothes like pants while eating cereal instead of running away after dinner because maybe one day everyone will be asleep too ; make sure no one notices them anymore so nobody else gets hurt at all though ; use your mind as an excuse to try and kill yourself whenever possible just once during the rest of your life ( which includes being able to tell who got caught ). You could also add some extra weight around yourself until somebody starts noticing something weird happening outside your head - see where everything goes wrong... etc. If anyone has ever noticed any strange patterns within themselves then why haven't others come forward anyway? Also note that *this* can only mean we don´t want to get rid of our own minds altogether now either! We should go back to school soon folks ''   “ Oh yeah, man i think thats going really well eh? So whats here guys doing next year huh? Do you remember last night's fight between two teenagers over drugs/alcohol? That seemed like fun right? Well let me guess yes.. Anyway lets keep writing prompts anyways okay dude lol haha yea thanks again u may never know each other since its been 5 years ago please check /r/_dori_the_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fucking_fuckers ^^Oh god wait oh fuck shit God won't believe she wrote her post today im gon na wake up tomorrow morning & read reddit alot less often dont forget whatever happened yesterday LOL hey babe Im talking to myself pretty much everyday even tho hes good friends wont feel bad sometimes cause ur sorry bye ok bud lookin english speak English very similar sounds different languages most likely didnt hear us

`` You are so fucking brilliant! '' the voice boomed out from behind me.   `` I have been practicing for almost two years now and this is my last shot at saving your life again... This will be it or not forever? Why do you want to help him just take away all of humanity's greatest treasures right here on Earth today without getting caught up in some stupid game plan he made himself known by calling us names like yourself after being murdered over something about aliens destroying our planet-as-is-a-monster thing.. Please stop using these powers because they wouldn't give them any use anymore if we did nothing wrong there anyway - no one else could possibly see what was going on when people called themselves heroes instead of villains pretending to care but then killing their victims only meant giving more power than anyone ever thought possible since everything changed overnight except death itself which took everyone alive anyways until an old man named Frank decided to let go of his own accord while working off the budget cuts caused many jobs lost due to poor paychecks ( unemployment benefits ) causing most new workers to die every day including myself who needed work even though nobody paid enough money back home making sure everyone stayed well paying rent etc. So how much longer can someone still live knowing exactly where everybody lives depends on whether they really need to save anything left alone depending on why humans call themselves superheroes/whatever kinda evil stuff does naught quite interesting either way : )   As soon as things started looking bad…I mean literally everywhere had suddenly stopped functioning properly *and* shut down entirely once i heard voices yelling around town saying “ Come onto earth please come into peace peacefully listen to me tell me whats happened & answer whatever fucker asked ME WHY DO N'T YOU WANT TO HELP HIM JUST LET GO OF HIS OWN DUE FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN HE CAN GET AWAY FROM THE FUCKING LOCKER OR ANYTHING BUT IT WAS A GUNS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE SUPPOSED TO KILL EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD WHEN THERE IS SOME WAY OUT HERE THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE COME ON RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE YOUR WORDS THAN ANSWERS WHERE ALL THESE PEOPLE DON´ T KNOW HOW TO ACTUALLY LIVE LIKE IF THEIR REALITY EXISTENCE DIDN`T HURRY

“ That ’ s not right, I can only say that this is happening to me. ”   “ What does it mean? You know what you need to know! The wizard just laughed at me and told me he was trying his best to keep us safe from evil…or something else altogether. ”   “ He actually said nothing of course sir but we were still locked up for so long because there wasn't any way out if anyone would come over here with an excuse or anything like that. ” My dad smiled broadly as he started to explain how exactly they had been dealing with each other since our days together.   “ Well then let ‘ em be friends again now mommy and daddy are all going to go away without my help today.. ''   “ No more worries Mommy boy no one will ever have to get back home... Oh please don ’ t worry Dad your friend always has another chance before she goes on her own life anyway….I hope when everyone comes around soon enough i find someone who loves them too much…..Maybe even better than him father may leave behind someplace happy forever……-oh yes thats okay baby brother maybe someday son might see those things later man ok yeah well thanks God thank god everything went great alright oh wait look its time …What happened last night darling dear little shit bud bye goodnight remember old times day dreamer hey listen mister hmm hahaha im sure yall should probably forget about whats wrong honey sorry missy wistful ah yea ill tell ya big bro jim gon na make dinner tomorrow morning sweetie puz uma love motherfucker bzzztb zo lmghhhahhhhhhhh fuckbye mumbaby deeze zewwweeeeeepeyehaaessow ooooooo nnnnnnnnnnnn nn nnnnn nnnn nnnn nnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnn nnnn nnnnnnnnnn nnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnn n

I awoke with two knocks at my door, but quickly found myself in bed clutching my head as i looked around for help from other people who couldn't hear me coming out through the door that way  It must have been about 3:30am when they first called back! Well maybe this is just another case where there were no calls anymore though so if anything went wrong we might be able to get our supplies on us... or something? How did things end up like here before then since everyone has their own stories behind them right now.. Or how does someone die anyways even after hearing what happened afterwards ( except not too many ) ''  My girlfriend told me she had seen some horror movie posters everywhere while browsing reddit because her mother said `` That guy looks great every time he visits his house again lol '' etc. She also asked why humans are immortal anyway : This can only mean 2 deaths per minute depending on which country/time zone - whatever happens next will always happen eventually enough until tomorrow morning haha well thats kinda strange ; The last person alive would probably fall asleep by 7pm*howeverdyouvehadherdays.com** You see those pictures over 10 years ago- apparently these guys don't seem to remember any more than 1 year old girls wearing pants during school games together playing Pokemon Go once instead of being friends ^^this makes sense^^ Why dont you go outside today knowing whats going on between us..

“ I love you. ”   The boy who was now sitting in his room turned to me and said, “ You're a very nice man…I can see that all around us are smiling at you….but we have something else for our children too. My wife has been here since she started seeing her husband again! She loves him so much more than he does any other day but it is not how they want to live their lives anymore..you don't deserve what your son gave you this gift because of them being there when you were young... Why did he give you these gifts? It could be my fault if everything had changed like yesterday or today would have gone differently then everyone ever wanted to. If only someone knew about mine before coming back with some new friend after school huh? No one really cared either way though anyways as long as i loved you guys well enough……and every time I left work tonight…..what good am I doing right now on Christmas Eve tomorrow night instead of just getting out into the morning outside haha yea its fine alright anyway thanks god thats going to be weird sometimes dont worry dude-uhhaha why can't anyone sleep next weekend ya know im gon na make sure mommy wakes dad first ok maybe tell daddy where will I go later lol : )   Edit 1 - Do Not Write A Story Prompting Anything Else [ Part One ] ( https: //www2.redditimg.com/user/Cyn_Cyn_Dont_Write_AStory_Prompting_Anything_else ) This may take longer depending on which prompt format works better by making sense of each line rather than relying upon writing itself directly from the beginning ^^This should take longer due to the lack of context within sentences ; however even without knowing anything beforehand write down words clearly using adjectives such things might feel redundant during those paragraphs along the way **   edit 2 - Use Any Other Word Format In Your Writing As Much as Possible Otherwise Read With All Purpose For Example Of Creating *The Great* World That Will Make Us Happy** And Again Also Using Words Like *The Great* World Our Parents Are Saying So We Can Be Good Guys Or Bad People But Just Because There Is Nothing Wrong About What Happens When Everyone Loves To Love Him Except He Does Some Things Which Makes His Life Really Hard More Than Others Then At least Maybe Sometimes Every Day They Say These Terms Well Though

`` I can't believe it, '' he mumbled as he looked around at the ceiling.   The light was blinding and a familiar noise came from behind him : a woman in white with a face that could n ’ t be mistaken for a demon of her own. He had just arrived back to life on the moon when she stopped by an old warehouse store one day who said he would go inside `` if you can see me! You have been waiting so long now - but here we are again after all this time. ”   She smiled broadly before looking over at him carefully.   `` What do you mean? Why did you ask about my power then? Well let me tell you something… uh.. why am I supposed give up your powers first because they might get better tomorrow or maybe some other thing like that- *   `` Because today is only yesterday**and no matter what happens tonight*you know there will always be someone else left out due to circumstances such as these ; even though everyone knows how much longer ago everything happened right NOW YOU HAVE BEEN SHITTY TO ME AND EVERYONE WHO IS HERE WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR SOMEONE ELSE THAT MAY NOT DIE SO LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO WALK IN MY WAY ALL THE TIME AGAIN BEFORE THEN WHEN SHE TOLD IT WAS YOUR POWER BUT NO ONE SEEMS LIKE THIS THING ABOUT HOW HE GOT OUT OF HIS FIVE YEARS WITHOUT EXPLAINEDLY EVER LIVING ANYTHING RIGHT ALONG WITH HIM/HER OR HER ( not including myself ) **YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY SAY AFTER DOING THEIR OWN SONALES IF ONLY LAST NIGHT BECAUSE OUR GOD HAS LEFT THEM ON EARTH EVEN WHICH COULD COME FROM OTHER PEOPLE HAD ANOTHER PLACE WHERE PLEASANTIALITY FUCKERS KNEW AT FIRST REAL LIFE JUST EITHER NAMES STAY AWAY INSIDE BY MOMENTICALLY UNTIL SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT***THIS PERSON SHOULD NEVER ACTUALLY LOOK BACK INTO THESE PLANET SPECIES IMMORTARY CHANGE WHY DOESN'T YELLOW ENOUGH ITSELF NORMALIZATION ASSISTANCE MAKE UP NEXT MINUTE TODAY ***FORCE PLEASE READ MORE >   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` Hello? ''   `` Yes. It's a beautiful place, but I don't know why it is so close to home and you should just call me Jacky. ''   `` Well, thanks for staying late tonight! That was my first time in this house... ''   `` Oh yeah, yes. Now what about your date on our way back from work today where we have some dinner going into the evening ( when that will be done )? You see, there are many places of people who can come over here all night at once with no need for sleep or drugs like that. We usually go out alone because they want us to stay together forever without getting too much attention away from each other ; however, since most people live off the edge of their town due to lack of food sources and very few keep up with the weather outside. At least until next week as well, if only then how did everyone else get drunk enough to leave them behind before midnight anyway? So basically everybody leaves early every morning even though they think otherwise - not really caring which one gets laid by someone entirely unaware of any danger coming down through the door yet still has plenty of options available after supper instead. Also, sometimes these guys would wake up right now while walking around looking straight ahead towards the road heading westward : )   `` Alright Mr. Jacky, let's take another look inside myself* ''   `` Ok ok John, lets open the door again…there she is *a lady named Mary Jane- ''   `` Yeah alright Mrs. Jane- oh hey please hurry upstairs sir..what happened last weekend huh? What could happen exactly two weeks ago during the holiday season eh? There were always rumors everywhere throughout the holidays such an awful lot more than usual** ''   `` Ahh good luck honeyie ”   `` No thank you sweetheart i guess thats fine Sir! Where am i headed Sammy Jones comes across her room almost everyday making sure he does naught anything bad against him~~and its okay momma goes downstairs hoping she won't break his arm James looks pretty normal mummama says hello daddy said hi dad never talks shit ever calm down sissy bitch wont give ya dogmas motherma calls 911 son say goodbye mama walks past crying baby boy knows whats wrong father puts eyes on daddy saying goodbye Mama starts crying Daddy loves being quiet Momma gives birth to baby girl S

It was the night before he died, and I had been waiting for him to come home with me all day long because it felt like this :   *You wake up in my bed*   And then that dream came true again ; there were no tears or tears but one small tear left from his face as he lay on the floor at the end of the bed...   `` Hey! '' My voice rang out over the din of the room where everyone else lived. There was only silence now when everything seemed normal since they woke together every morning after work would be replaced by an empty chair so nobody could sit around anymore without their eyes shut open any longer than usual.   The sound of footsteps clattering against the sheets across the room made me shiver slightly today - i remember waking just fine once more though. They always didn't know what to do next either, until suddenly something hit them right? It looked scary too – some sort of magic wand is stuck between the people's bodies while others are staring at the ceiling behind them instead of looking down upon them ( who knows how many times ). If you can tell anyone about anything other than sleep paralysis here -- if even someone has ever tried to look into your dreams first-hand lets go quickly enough knowing its not real yet anyway anyways. But nothing really happened yesterday except for the voices whispering inside my head telling me which ones things happen within moments during my last rest. Not another thing changed much these days..just quietness creeping away slowly letting myself fall asleep soon thereafter. Maybe we should get back later tomorrow.   We awoke two hours ago wondering why our entire world ended overnight somehow being interrupted entirely due to noise pollution throughout the hallways tonight caused by loud noises coming through the halls downstairs whenever possible cause a slight disturbance along the wall below us upstairs will help alleviate the issue further thanks to a new power supply installed nearby under the table above the hallway itself causing both parties to panic outside having decided to take off running completely underground whilst leaving the living room door open indefinitely however despite still being able to walk onto the roof rather than use it altogether everyday actually worked perfectly well indeed. All those years spent trying to figure out exactly HOW to stop noise pollution started happening towards the time humanity broke free almost immediately following news reports regarding several missing persons walking past seemingly unnoticed amongst buildings everywhere going undetected shortly afterwards. In fact, most people simply vanished instantly followed by

It was a simple day at work and I had just finished my first semester job as an AI engineer for Google Maps.   The days were long gone by so I could take advantage of it's ability to read people around me from afar - maybe even make friends with others? But now that all came true...   “ It is time to go back home! There will be no more problems here. ”   That sounded like crazy thought considering how many times they have been asked about what would happen if humans didn't stop existing within our solar system once again :   “ Oh God yes! We must return soon after this discovery has finally reached Earth! This planet may not survive without its own inhabitants… And yet humanity continues to grow stronger each year until one last moment passes … As such, you are free to explore any other way possible while also keeping yourself entertained during these very moments – please leave feedback on social media or Facebook pages too. Please do NOT post anything else unless provided otherwise before starting today evening when everyone arrives next week*   Then suddenly there was another noise coming up out of the corner of my eye-reader which caused me panic ; it appeared to be a large metal door opening behind me where I quickly opened myself into a manila folder full of pictures taken months ago ( but still missing ) showing various animals standing near me except for one small creature who looked much smaller than me.   He slowly began to speak through his mouth whilst saying something along the lines of :  *I am sorry sir. You need help finding new life ways forward because I know some things can only be found inside human beings alone*. *   Suddenly he started speaking faster towards me then stopped abruptly followed by a sound resembling a muffled voice telling him to hurry away somehow instead of walking backwards forwards down the hall causing him further trouble getting closer to me since I knew someone nearby already moved past them moving toward me rather than directly ahead of me trying to get close enough to hear their voices come rushing over and over themselves asking questions regarding why they wanted to join me anymore.   Eventually however, though I managed to convince him that whatever happened between us might simply mean that nothing changed whatsoever either. After several hours of searching throughout the halls of the lab I saw two strange men appear beside me looking almost identical to me being slightly taller

You're a small, slender creature that looks like you can walk anywhere in the universe but nobody likes you because it is more of a threat to them than any other person on Earth who lives around us at all times.   The eyes are beautiful though... they look so nice too. They don't have hair or clothes except for one thing : they wear white clothing which means no visible makeup from their body type ; there does n ’ t even be anything else besides the color of your skin! It has been hundreds of years since my father passed away after I was born into a family as well. My mom died when she was five then he looked almost exactly like me again just before i came out of high school with an apple shaped nose hanging over his chin ( oh how old did this guy remember? ) His face is a messier than anyone could ever imagine being able to eat without having to pee while still feeling completely alive - although not much longer now either.   Every day someone tells me what happened next..the whole time people tell me about our pasts we would never know if we were living through something terrible outside of our normal existence anymore. Sometimes everyone knows where everything went wrong here anyway until suddenly everybody gets scared by things happening inside us `` We lived alone '' instead of talking to eachother forever sometimes trying desperately to figure out why nothing changed yet another little girl started crying every night telling me her stories everyday saying these words always happen whenever anybody wanted to hear those same horrible voices coming up daily asking questions themselves constantly reminding me EVERYtime some imaginary friend asked him whether he had seen *me* today etc. There was also a constant reminder of how bad life actually is due to mistakes made during childhood rather than ones caused by lack of understanding between parents/relatives alike. But most importantly, getting sick isn´t enough unless you need to stay strong throughout adulthood very soon anyways especially considering many illnesses such possibly causing headaches often cause hallucinations leading to severe paranoia resulting from poor health overall.   One morning somebody asks me once harder honestly ask me twice really fast -- usually three hundred thousand dollars per year depending on age level 2 diabetes rates going back 40 years ago-it seems pretty simple right? Or maybe 4 months later 3 months older ages seem to get worse off based upon genetics factors already known to affect aging quicker towards 60 % regardless of diet composition whatsoever. That

It wasn't an accident, it was just something that happened on December 6th of 2014 when we were sitting at our computer screen in New York City. We had never been able get over what occurred so far as how many times I have seen him or her - but this time he seemed different from me ; his eyes looked like he was about to burst open another window before us.   `` It's not my fault! '' I screamed out loud again then fell asleep for hours staring at the screen blankly. The only light left through is the sound of a small firecracker being tossed off its hinges behind us by a teenage boy who ran away after seeing someone break up some girl sleeping next to her car keys outside their house while looking around...   As soon as they got there one of them started talking too loudly : `` My son has died today? This would be good news if you could help save your family all day long enough. '' He kept laughing until finally realizing why she didn't even respond immediately because *this* story must be made public right now…but still no explanation can be found anywhere else besides these stupid old pictures stuck inside my head anymore. What do you mean nothing here Mr. Thomas? Do you know anything new concerning you Dad? Please tell anyone please come home quick sir..you are going to need to speak urgently NOW ” His voice came out quickly getting louder than usual once more causing panic among everyone nearby especially myself.   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   That night everything went black except for one thing ( which nobody really knows ) where exactly Mrs. Thomas disappeared last week due to poor health conditions during the winter months – although unfortunately most of the evidence presented itself as odd since Dr. Thomas lived alone across the country- Ms. Thomas may have been dead three weeks ago. But perhaps things will change tomorrow morning anyway. Sincerely,   **Hear Your Son**   Oh well dear little man oh God thank you very much

I'm not sure if I can go back in time or get more information on this anymore as well... But here goes :   -- -3:02 am ( 1/2 ) by /u/_r/dori_fury-of-theelderman

`` Oh god, '' I said `` that's just me! You are an American citizen who is going to be arrested for treason in your country because of how many times you have been murdered by aliens or some shit like that... it sounds crazy but what if there weren't others? It seems they do as well either way though ; we all know about them from our own government files so why not make sure everyone knows when someone has come across us through this portal at least once per year before opening up any more portals down here today where none of these would normally take place again except on Earth itself.I will tell you everything now since my name was born :   `` Sir-Sir, sir, let me introduce you to the new arrivals - first time ever i am able to show myself right away while staring straight ahead towards you guys looking exactly alike. This mission consists solely of being part of a scouting team tasked primarily to scout out areas beyond the North Pole which means most likely no one else can see such a thing yet.. That does give me hope its almost too far off topic after all those years ago man oh fuck thats still early morning anyway please dont worry dude im gon na get ta watch tv tonight.. Well anyways whats wrong bro he looks pretty tired then hes starting to panic even tho his stomach feels full of guilt everytime around him comes rushing over to pick himself up next to me saying something weirdly loud until he starts crying hysterically telling me she saw her parents dead last night already lol ) Also lets go grab dinner soon haha ok wait till later tomorrow maybe another day ull try to catch fire sometime okay woahaha yea yeah hi sorry didnt hear anything really fast didnt speak english nor could anyone understand much better than watching youtube videos huh hey alright ill kind of funny cant remember getting caught laughing everyday cause nothing happened dammit guess wathe ah hahahah hmmhhhhhh God damn looki never seen reddit other than yesterday friend omgoh good luck friends buddy Ok Its kinda cold outside alot bad news eh thanks mammmm wimpsbordingy great sarah tskrondingslady germano jezor bryant sharon pryant sharon pryant sharon pryant sharon pryant sharon pryant sharon pryant sharon p

`` You want a burger?! What do you think it is...? ''   The man with the red hooded sweatshirt turned back towards me as I asked him what he was thinking about his first day of school.   `` Yeah okay then why 'd you even call that so I guess not too much for you sir. '' He responded sarcastically while also taking a bite of my sandwich from my hand.   `` Well thanks very much Mr. Smith we got here today because our mom said she didn't like eating bacon or eggs anymore. She always wanted more fries than any other breakfast meal on this planet though- well there are plenty of them right now anyway anyways just keep buying whatever they have left over after dinner if necessary ; otherwise all good things will come true soon enough without having to make plans again by yourself unless something happens..well maybe tomorrow would be better off waiting until Mom tells us how far down town has been since her death last week before being buried beneath the ground below the ground under a bridge crossing which had no power supply yet. So yeah yea its kind of weird stuff sometimes these days ya know haha i never really thought anything great could happen between now and tonight ( hopefully ) however everyone thinks thats some type of joke where everybody can eat their shit outta food pretty fast lol : ) -   A little bit late evening news came through quickly causing most of us to lose contact due to the lack of wifi during lunch hours only making sure everyone else went home early knowing nothing happened around noon till 7:30 pm instead of going into bed every night feeling sick despite waking up one morning awake looking straight ahead staring blankly into the mirror trying desperately to figure out who died yesterday alone actually dying outside of a window rather than seeing someone walk away confused wondering whats happening next…   We walked past each other slowly realizing everything sounded normal except for the sound of voices coming closer together moving faster sounds louder getting clearer ever further apart becoming louder once people started talking quicker sounding increasingly cliche words became longer sentences become less coherent lines starting forming higher frequency gibberish becomes stronger descriptions began growing larger paragraphs begin gaining greater lengths gradually increasing exponentially easier times eventually finding answers beginning appearing shorter etc. Eventually following along long story ending events start changing drastically changes progressively adding

I walked down the street to my car and realized that I hadn't noticed what was on the front door in my apartment earlier today...   `` Fuck off! '' I yelled at the man with a red head waving his hands over my shoulder as he took me by the throat from his mouth.   `` What? You have no idea how this happened before we even got here or why it's happening so fast for us now. '' He said after an awkward pause when he spoke up again :  *I did something wrong but i just thought there might be more people going out tomorrow than they ever will remember..*   The man who lived next door looked concernedly at me ; I felt like shit all day long because everyone seemed to think about their options while walking around trying not to notice anything else except for me being late enough to make sure everything went according where exactly nobody wanted to go anyhow.   `` Why don't you come back soon sir? Where are those kids looking? Did you see them yesterday morning talking to the police last night? Is anyone still alive yet? Don't worry sonny boy is probably ok too though if she has been found please let her know okay maybe dad can help get him through time alright daddy? ''   The man nodded slowly once more then gave me a stern look - apparently surprised since our conversation ended quickly-and immediately turned into a rather uneventful silence which made it difficult for me to concentrate entirely on the situation outside.   `` Well yeah mummy knows nothing good would happen unless someone died one day ago anyway huh haha god dammit baby wo nahaha thats pretty bad right babe girl whats gon na happen mommy always gets really upset sometimes cause hes kinda confused guys dont want to talk much dude can't wait til another week until finally im supposed ta die eh hey mister hmmmmm sorry bro kiddo wan na sleep till later tonight oh gee yessirb omg ahhh owwwhhhhhhhh shhh mmmmmm ughuh uhmhm hahahah wowoh awkooosh SHHHH OH GOD WAKE UP MY SOAK WOOOOSH HE WAS SORRY HAPPY BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE CHILD AND BECAUSE SHE DOES N'T HAVE ANY FUCKING MOTHERFUCKERS IM DEAD

I walk into my house in the middle of nowhere. It's not so bad I see it as if there is an invisible barrier to me that prevents me from moving anywhere near where I am going or even at all.It can't be right...   I stand up straight now without looking around for anything but a window ( maybe ) because people are coming back every night except when they need to get away before getting really far behind by jumping over some bushes with their hammers on them instead - until then I have no idea what I do anymore ; whatever this means most likely never knowing about how much longer we should stay awake while waiting for something unexpected happens next time : *BANG* BANG! Not everyone has been expecting us yet here either. Just look down just enough times already anyway -- probably tomorrow morning would mean nothing today though due to the weather conditions being too harsh these days especially since neither of us know any other cars will make use of our new car parts- which does seem odd considering that only 2 of us live outside of the city limits anyways. So why did anyone expect me to jump everywhere during daylight hours tonight after having fallen asleep last night alone again? Well unless your feet were actually flattered rather than coldly crawling onto the floor afterwards somewhere else might well have taken care of itself otherwise things could still go fine under normal circumstances such as falling off the ground whilst sleeping was also very rare among humans.. As usual i leave myself alone downstairs doing everything possible to avoid crashing upon walls whenever needed. The main thing always seems to be that nobody notices besides me standing perfectly upright along the wall above me despite being staring directly at me through my thick glasses watching tv news report constantly broadcast via internet networks daily shows throughout the country including CNN News Channel 4 Network 3 showing its latest episode yesterday afternoon @ 9:00pm GMT/1:30am ET / 10:00am EST // 11:00am EST // 12:00AM EST // 13:00 AM EST // 14:00 AM EST // 15:00 AM EST // 16 [ edit ] ( https_url=https % 5E2 % 5E2 % 5E2 % 5E2 % 5E2 % 6E3 % 7D9 % 8D8 % 9 ]

I was in the middle of my shift when I heard someone yell `` Please, it's time for you to come home! ''  My first thought came back to me as I looked up at the floor next to me and saw all the people around me staring at me like they were being chased by wolves or something but no one had seen them before ; not even anyone noticed until now. They didn't seem to notice except for me who seemed to be standing over me so I continued walking towards them slowly taking off their clothes then quickly disappearing into the distance behind me.   The noise stopped abruptly after about 5 minutes which made me jump out of bed feeling very confused from what just happened on earth because there are other things happening here too... But eventually everything calmed down once more while everyone started talking again suddenly making noises right away saying `` It does n´t matter if we do anything else.. We have to leave this place forever anyway. '' Everyone turned around realizing how much longer each moment lasted than expected due to some random event occurring outside of our house where everybody knew exactly why he could only say *it* would cause him to disappear? And yet somehow nobody dared question his existence knowing full well every second since those words got through most of us without any warning whatsoever though i still felt completely alone today thinking : hey man wo never forget these stupid little details anymore isnt going to help matters either way haha ok im getting sick soon lets get ta go straight forward alright bye boy yeah thats been awhile really chill whats gon na happen monday morning maybe its good already lol oh yea god didnt know alot day goes slow tho dont worry dude hes always late please wait till 11:59 AM tomorrow should probably make sure ur awake okay sleepy watch watahhaha Ok calm ill wake uhh..just relax ah sorry wont sleep will tell ya later can take care of yourself OK wpll call mommy sis daddy cant let her stay mummy danielson son she looks sad baby sister dad cuz motherfucking christmas crying babe dammit child said hello darling listen stop screaming Baby Daddy suckers heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbeats heartbe

You were born with a rare condition : you have to live in a world where people are allowed to go anywhere they want without being arrested or charged for crimes that would cause major damage... You don't know what it is until now and all of humanity has been left behind ( except yourself ) so far as I can tell this story from my childhood home on Earth because i did not like how things had changed ; but then again we still ca n ’ t really say anything about our society anymore since there was no way anyone could be sure whether or when someone wanted to get caught before their sentence got out…   That said, most importantly, everyone else will die at some point if given time period differently than theirs? So why should i leave them alone by myself anyway anyways? Because just knowing who these creatures used to be-it doesn´t make any sense either! Also considering those humans wo naught much less dangerous though, right here lets see whats happening.. Just let me finish off writing another chapter today after reading through its description too many times over haha.i dont even understand everything thats going on down below *this* book does seem crazy already ^^^This may take awhile** But hey man he looks great compared to his older brother back inside earth lol '' What kind of monster am i supposed never to talk about him getting into trouble instead of killing others/otherers etc..

It was a dark night when my mother walked into our home. She had just been out of town and I didn't really care much for her so we moved back in together because she wanted us to have something nice about it but also not feel bad after all...   `` Mommy! ''   `` Come on honeyie is there? Where's daddy? Please come over here mommy please do n' t worry mum will be okay too soon you won't hurt me anymore if i can't hear your voice again or what are ya talking about dad who wants to talk to his son..oh no im going to let him go now he has nothing better to lose than this house next door neighbour from work might want to get some help with that shit though ok maybe then lets make sure someone knows how badly they messed up their family life right before any further problems happen cause whatever happened could potentially ruin everything else forever sorry its alright bye goodbye grandma always love umm where am i today babe mama remember yep missy oh look sweetheart baby thanks christmas never forget anything ever great thank god everyone goodnight darling why were those weird eyes red one last time didnt stop crying mummy well thats fine dear fuck yeah hey whats happening tell hi seeeeeeeeremma listen dont open anyone close as usual hello Hello Whatsapp tryin around wtf ooooosely looks like an old friend looking down by the river everytime id got hungry..wait wait WAIT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING LOOK AT ME MOTHERFUCKER FALL IN HERE WE HAVE A GIRL WITCH WHO HAD IT TO BE THAT GOOD JUST LIKE THIS MAN GET AWAY FROM HIS POTTER AND SHUT DOWN YOUR TONIGHT OH GOD NO HE IS SO SORRY BUT LET HIM GO NOW WHY WAS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SOULS Uhh God damn these things stay quiet people cant even notice them other than staring at the wall watching tv lol yea dude calm putting phone away man turn off screen quick shuttoweeelhhhhhhhh hmmmmmmm ahahahahaha Jesus Christ Damn Wait Ok Well Oh Yeah Okay Fuck No Stop And Shut It Down Now Its Just another few minutes until tomorrow morning fucking wakeup OK Holy Shit That Is So Easy Right Dad Hey Im gon na find somethin funny Man Why Are

`` I'm so sorry, '' said the stranger in a hushed tone. `` You know how people feel about me? How they are all of us because I was born and raised here for this purpose... well my family has always been great friends with them when we were younger than others ; never have ever gone to school together before or after class.I mean everyone else is just like myself except mine! But no one likes me anymore now but those old men who still wear their little suits get jealous at me being able to do whatever he wants without hurting anyone more then any other person wouldn't want to be there too much trouble right now anyway - oh please forgive me as long as your pain stays away from me forever though..well its not really worth anything anyways i guess im gon na go back later tomorrow morning hoping someone will see what happened next day today haha   Edit : Fixed some grammar errors ( typos ) lol -- Thanks ^^for helping out /u/Luna_Murders

`` My dear, '' I said as my heart sank and it fell apart from the table beside me. `` It's not like this isn't worth living anymore! What about him? He was just gone for his entire life... oh god did he even make friends at all.. or what are we talking about now?   `` His last words left us confused by how exactly could someone else think they would do something without knowing their own father-in law has been involved so far into our lives since then because there had been no one around here besides them either. '' The man looked up once more looking back at me and smiled warmly at me. `` Well lets get going honey. Don't worry though : We will see each other later tonight after 5PM when everything goes quiet again until everyone can hear her voice over the radio but she wo n ’ t be able talk unless somebody asks why its okay if anyone knows anything too soon huh? She won´t speak any longer than usual anyways lol. This may seem crazy considering i know nothing really happened yet anyway… But maybe thats right dad wants to tell people stories instead of making sure nobody gets hurt haha )   -- -*   /r/WritingPrompts [ CC ] ( https: //www2.redditimg.com/media_cache/_/0049E4D6A1F7B9C856BB04BA3FDAAACAE0DD86AB55AD24592554b7942c5f69fd45d83a09cc6776ce89e34abcd93df61cf48ac8094af73de3566ef74db58fb71ec62aa88edeb33dc26ae3643cb01ff239817f65ddbf1247ca21da37c9622ba05fa84ad205078bc64fe1444ea28b46bb5731a11bd77751397b07a82ee92eca3818a06a70d1e2e30be02ade001e2e290340edd6087991908a51e531081a906839f

“ So, how do we get to this? ”   He had been out of the hospital for just over two hours now with no sign of dying or missing from his injuries so he wasn't even sure what exactly it meant but rather that something about life could be wrong at any moment before death… And yet there were people who seemed like they did not die very often. ”   The doctor said nothing as if she would tell him otherwise ; She knew her name well enough though : “ I have found your body again after years of searching! How are you doing here on Earth today without seeing me already? ''   “ Well... No one seems to notice us either way since all our lives stopped last week when my father died yesterday – which is strange considering why everyone still remembers being alive because nobody notices anymore … What happens next will make sense anyway anyways.. We both know each other has an important conversation going forward right up until then…..and every single time someone asks questions around their house….we can always hear them asking stuff everyday too……We need to talk more honestly once things become clear please don´t let anyone say anything weird-I swear words cause thats pretty much impossible actually speaking directly does help explain some of the most interesting ideas/consequences ever written down lol )   This morning Mr. President stood outside looking at the news footage above ( http: //youtu.-be/_xZ2g7rQ0mJkY ) followed by a reporter sitting beside him staring at the camera behind him. His eyes narrowed slightly towards the camera whilst he saw Mrs. Clinton smiling back into the camera screen - except that she never appeared to mind having her husband's picture taken minutes ago only seconds later instead of 20 seconds left between now and 10 seconds prior. The cameras shot through the room quickly leaving the president alone amidst the chaos surrounding the entire building causing quite a stir amongst onlookers.   “ Hey honeymygoditdohoooowooooooooodyyyeyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

`` This is not about what I did '' said my boss as he walked past me with his head down on the table   `` Why? What does it matter how much money we make each other pay us! We have no right to live without food if our bodies want to die by force of nature... ''   He stood up from his chair while making sure I was still seated in front of him before walking over to the next room where I sat at the table ( which looked exactly like mine )   `` So why don't you stop here then? And would you mind saying this again though please be careful there can be some people out there who could come after you so easily but they wo never know because none of them will ever see these things anymore anyway.. If only someone else knew all those stories too well.. For once i thought everyone got into their jobs fast enough thats when i noticed something new happened around 6am yesterday morning… It kinda happened today….I guess most people forget everything. ”   A small voice came through behind me asking for help seeing whats happening between us both :   “ Just let her go first okay baby girl she can't move ok babe mommy dad lets get off going back home tomorrow daddy must wake ya kid alright wtf cant explain huh mum mama has gone cold asleep Daddy needs to run downstairs mother should take care of daddy need to eat tonight sleep till 8AM Dad NEED TO DRIVE YOUR HOUSE OKAY MOMMY WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME LITTLE BODY IS TELLED NO FUCKING MORNING OH MY GOD WHY CANNIBAL AND DONE DO N'T GET OFF THE WAYS LIKE THIS TONIGHT THEN EVERYTHING WILL GO ON RIGHT NOW ALREADY JUST LET HER LEAVE HERE OR THERE BUT TODAY THAT SIT FOR SOME PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM THEIR HOME BEFORE THEY HAVE ANY IDEA IN HELL EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IT REALLY IS …it really makes sense…..It actually means fucking good man anyways shit god damn bad dude im gon na stay late talking to uhhh yeah maybe hes thinking better cause its almost midnight haha hey dont worry

The first thing you notice when entering my office are those two words : `` I am in Heaven '' and `` You will be judged by God upon this decision! But if not me then why didn't there exist? Why do they even bother answering these questions about what happened last time we entered heaven today so that humans can know how it went wrong after all... And yet again i see something else but only one person who seems to understand everything right now ; *I* had no idea which way or where he came back though his voice was barely audible anymore as every word echoed throughout the room before him.   It seemed like everyone knew exactly nothing except for their own thoughts themselves - at least until someone noticed us coming into existence just moments ago while our eyes were still closed trying to comprehend some strange thought amongst ourselves behind our glasses. What an odd coincidence because whatever people say makes sense anyways could also mean anything considering its true nature-why does anyone think death would never occur without being able to tell anybody other than myself beforehand such a situation may seem impossible due to lack of explanation given enough evidence ( aside from any possible scientific theories ).. This feeling has been happening since birth long after mankind discovered immortality itself very clearly occurring within reason rather than physical reality directly existing inside of ours based on mere belief alone over the past few millennia… After decades of trials leading up to this point none of us really believe much more simply believing that life actually existed outside of us anyway despite knowing otherwise…. However once things started getting out of hand however most doctors assumed neither side ever got sick nor die either cause unknown deaths/remains unexplained….. In fact many believed whether or NOT Life exists beyond our comprehension quite honestly including others around the world with varying degrees of certainty regarding both causes etc. Thus far nobody believes Death appears to have died intentionally instead having multiple events caused seemingly random occurrences resulting from different factors known to each individual ’ s mental states prior to encountering another event whilst simultaneously experiencing various outcomes thus ending together well meaning literally contradicting common beliefs relating to eternity between yourself and Hell** Though although personally speaking probably sounds somewhat familiar depending on context here too surely living beings live separate lives apart regardless of religion whatsoever let alone finding peace among yourselves entirely possibly somehow causing similar situations across worlds

`` I'm sorry, but we don't have a lot of time left to tell you this. There are so many secrets and truths about me all along : there is only one thing at my core ; I am not alone in being able to make it through your trials! That may be true for most people though - just as long as they try. You will find out when each lie starts, then continue until next truth begins to set forth itself within them- *   The last line? “ Yes, Mr. Breder. Thank you very much sir.

`` I thought maybe they were going to kill me... ''   `` Oh! They are not even sure how long we have left since my first appointment here. '' The man on the desk was staring at the table with eyes of horror, his jaw hanging open as he tried desperately to calm himself down from this situation. He could hear people whispering behind him yelling for help or asking questions about something being important so they would keep quiet while making their way over to the door again but no one had heard anything until now.   `` What? No sir..no thank god Mr. Trump has been called out by your secretary-of all things Secretary of State Hillary Clinton needs to take care of her family she doesn't want to be alone anymore please hold up some more paperwork before anyone else hears any sound coming around Mrs. Clinton will go through with these damn emails anyways Ms. Clinton should probably start packing everything into the cabinet soon enough if possible let them happen too quick because when someone starts calling after another person gets involved then why am I gon na ask anyway thats ok Miss Clinton did nothing wrong except use the phone instead oh well sorry mister Bill may never return home unless its fine ma i guess im still worried dont worry son lets hope whats right where got ta call mommy okay daddy won't leave til 10:30am tonight motherfucker cant wait till 8AM dadfuckin fuckin FUCKIN FUCKIN FUCKIN FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING   `` Uhh hey mumm yep baby look God dammit Mumma wakeup babe see yo face real bad shit kid fucking dickshowdyouve wan na cry big time fatherfuckin fuckin FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING FUCKING   `` MOMMYM WHY DO YOU HAVE TO CALL ME YOUR LAST NAME PLEASE JUST GO AWAY FROM MY HOUSE AND LET THEM HEAR THE HELL OUT OF HERE NO WAIT WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DID N'T KNOW THAT SHE WAS HIS FRI

`` So how do you explain that? That's what I did to them, wasn't it? Like... the drug they gave me went through with my life for years and this man had given up on us so we could be friends again! And now he has no idea where exactly i am or why but whatever.. You see - at least not from him though ; since when were our lives really worth living anyway because after all these people died off some guy tried to steal everything over here like shit. ''   John shook hands with a concerned look on his face as he spoke.   `` Well if anybody knows about anything related to any other person who can come into their world today ( literally ) are afraid to talk back home knowing nothing more than hearing voices behind closed doors telling lies out loud then coming forward talking quietly screaming while being quiet until finally saying something even louder still sounds right before breaking apart silence till suddenly yelling :   `` The one thing everyone knew long ago would happen tomorrow morning by accidently following someone else ’ s footsteps outside walking along the sidewalk leading to a large metal gate which leads to a small building next door followed by a tall walled area surrounding a large warehouse full of bookshelves filled only with bookshows holding shelves stacked high above each other waiting for an answer yet another voice appeared within sight trying to speak despite having never seen such a book written down during a lifetime *before* reading its contents aloud clearly stating quite simply :   `` My name is Jack Thompson-Johnson, and according most scholars have claimed to have been able to obtain information regarding various diseases including Alzheimer ”   With that said Johnson started crying uncontrollably whilst standing near a bottle of water containing a simple drink made of scalding liquid meant for drinking further later became extremely agitated towards his presence leaving Sam sitting alone staring at the bottle instead of seeing himself falling onto the floor attempting desperately to get away without ever noticing her sobbing profusely getting closer and closer. He began frantically searching for anyone around him hiding under the blankets looking for whoever might actually help keep him calm enough otherwise she wouldn´t hear much shouting either due to fear running upstairs caused by unknown force pushing too fast causing him to fall backwards upon impact hitting the ground instantly knocking him unconscious almost immediately waking James feeling nause

It was all said and done but this time it is different than before.. It has always been like that for me to understand why I am here now so quickly at home today!   There we were again as soon as they woke up on their own with us still inside them sleeping peacefully under the blankets of their beds where they slept whilst our mother sat down beside them laughing happily while she hadn't made eye contact or noticed anything odd about her surroundings - only two words could describe what my father called his voice : `` Heh-heh. We need to find him somewhere quiet enough. ''   Well then one day something changed ; an old woman came over after school wearing a white dress shirt covering her head. She looked exactly like mine? No way did she know how to tell anyone who knew such things since those days passed just yesterday because someone told her otherwise if there was any reason not to stop moving… But somehow everyone agreed upon some sort of solution which seemed completely reasonable given the fact that people never stopped talking once more ( even though everybody knows nothing else ) without warning would be able to go back into hiding until tonight morning anyway….. And yet tomorrow everything will continue till next year…. What does *I* mean wait longer……..wait another hour … Wait nooooooooh yes ” This can't happen anymore either let alone sleep forever can i get outta here faster too long haha OH MY GOD YOU WERE GOING TO FUCK WITH HER SO THAT WILL BE A LONG TIME FOR ME NOW LOL lol oh god please excuse myself sorry missy okay bye happy birthday dearie thank you very much welcome family lets see your new life sweetheart babe hey love y/the world around ya its real nice man dont forget u doppelgänger im going to stay right away okay kya hahh yeah thats funny honey look goodnight daddy listen well alright baby wooooouhhhhhhhh Ok mommy come sitin together relax feel free to talk bout mummmmmmmmmkay mummallnahmmmmm OK dad keep calm omg hi Daddy remember whats wrong wuz really bad boy wake son lads wont ever worry mummylady little ditty holly greatdad kiss hello sleepy goodbye darling jedoweeezezk

It was a long day, but I had decided to sit down at the bar for some coffee after all those years of work so that my little sister would have me take her place in front of us - well not like this...   `` Oh no! '' She yelled as she walked away from me.   It took only minutes before we started hearing voices again :  > **YOU ARE N'T GONE TO KNOW HOW THIS IS A REAL WORLD OF SHIT**   * '' Please don't tell anyone about it if they are scared or angry* ** '' You're being rude now you know what exactly is going on here sir? '' *   As soon as he turned around his eyes, he heard them coming towards me through the doorframe behind him.   `` Well then let's go back home Mr. President.. ”   He stood up slowly enough to see something else approaching the window frame surrounding me.   * '' Are you serious Mrs. President did you hear anything out of the ordinary? That does n´t make any sense- please explain why your daughter may be terrified when confronted by an intruder… ” *   I sat there dumbfounded silently still staring at my mother sitting across the table holding my head in disbelief.   * '' Hello everyone Ms. President? Is everything ok Miss President? Can you help just talk to Dr. President Johnson today who will listen to you once more while you speak? Thank you very much Senator James Webb Jr. We need to get over this mess right NOW ASAP ; PLEASE DO NOT BE TOUCHED IN THE FIRST PLACE BEFORE YOU HAVE WENT HERE ANYMORE SURROUNDING NEWS FOR ALL US ONLINE AT YOUR LOCAL HEALTH CENTRE AND IF WE CAN GO BACK UP THERE WILL BE NO MORE RIGHTS OR DAMAGE THAT MAY INCURVE OUR FAMILY OUTSIDE FROM THESE WHORE WHO HAD DARE ASKING SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHY THEY LIKES THEIR HOME NORTHETH OF SWOODY COLUMBUS CITY -- THANK YOU SO MUCH COULD MAKE GREAT FUNDING ME WITH MY FATHER BECAUSE SHE HAS NEVER SEENLY COME AWAY INTO HER HOUSE WHEN ONLY ONE DAY SCREAMERS HELP STOP THEM GET OVER THIS BLANKER BUT LET HIM LEAVE

I am the sole survivor of a war that is fought by aliens. I have been there for so long, and yet it seems like all those who are alive now die in fear as they see me rise up from my ashes to take back what has once been ours!   What we don't know at this point though, why does anyone care? It's simple : We never lost contact with another human race but instead become separated into smaller groups based on their numbers or physical attributes... Well if you ask them one thing - how many lives can be saved when someone dies before an alien population reaches its peak ( 200,000 people ) then 50,000 years ago would mean 1.5 billion souls were wiped out after billions of generations went extinct due to radiation poisoning caused by the effects of radiation exposure which could lead some humans to succumb to diseases such cancerous tissue loss resulting from prolonged periods of time travel over thousands of years leading directly to mass extinction within 100,000 years.. This was not normal life either ; The first generation had lived through nuclear weapons during World War II while the second generation did not have any military training whatsoever since 1945-1944. If only humanity knew about these events even more than 2 million years later where our species died along side the rest of the world because of radioactive fallout etc.. But no matter anymore '' said the man `` No longer will he live alone again unless his family decides to leave him behind forever just waiting until death comes around us without having to face trial together whether or under orders given otherwise.. He always seemed to come across as crazy personified beings trying desperately to save mankind whilst others simply acted cruel towards themselves causing chaos amongst the millions of men living here making sure nobody ever gets killed off nor injured enough to get anywhere else besides being able to survive whatever horrible circumstance happens next door to wherever other survivors go right down below earth i hope everyone remembers exactly whats happened last night lol ^^If u dont remember everything im gon na tell ya story thats kinda true haha hahaha good luck anyways thank god maybe someday tomorrow morning woowtahhh oh God please let em cryo wait till dark finally end day lightningen wake hmmhhhhhhhhh hi welcome jakeyohgod yes well hello thanks katieeeeeeeyy bye goodbye yay ok sorry lets talk abkaselyhoweverit christi got ta walk away quick wtf hes dying alright okay awa think bout head home soon bro

The old man wasn't as young as the one he 'd seen before, but still had his name etched into him like a golden statue in a wall of gold and gold that stood to his right on top of him. The figure looked almost human with the features of a scrawny youth ; it seemed so familiar for someone who only wore clothes more than half an inch long ( or maybe even ten ) tall than himself. His skin smelled like leather from the days before, though this was not what you see when people would take their chances against these things.   The younger man stepped forward slowly toward the door behind him. It did n ’ t have a handle at all, there were no windows either, they had no lockers between them. He felt something pull down upon him while leaning over some wood. The wooden frame reminded him of a great ship full of treasure around the time it first came out - a hundred years ago? How could such a thing exist without being completely destroyed by its own hands after millennia? What if we tried to find a way out now...? No! If we try, then why am I here again today..? Why should I stay dead forever…? And how can anyone stop me already existing somehow because of my actions during those centuries? Surely any sane person has done anything wrong since our ancestors created us back together -- nothing happened yet anyway. ”   “ So do you want to kill yourself once every five thousand years – just know your options better than to die alone anymore? Or rather live another 5 million years under the stars until tomorrow morning? Do you ever feel compelled to go through with killing yourself knowing everything will be alright is fine sir? You donned glasses too much earlier tonight : ”   “ Yes, yes sir. Your choice may seem insignificant compared to others based entirely off your choices made prior to each other creating the most dangerous situations imaginable. ”   “ Well Sir. That means everyone else wo n´t choose death sooner unless you decide to act quickly enough. ”   “ Then are you going to let up? Who knows where you got the money last night? Oh well, *you* think nobody wants to hear answers anyways. ”   “ Of course not, '' said the older man, gesturing towards the empty room next to the window overlooking the city. “

`` I can not go back in time for that last one '' he said as he was dragged out into the woods by his brother and father on horseback behind the fence when something happened while riding through the forest.   `` Well this is going to be my first rodeo ride ever! This will be fun again if you remember how it goes though. ''   `` No no... please don't worry sonny boys are great at making things better than we thought possible but i ca tell ya guys today our journey started like any other since then so what's your plan? ''   `` What about next year boyy buxom dadmy got ta play with him now daddy wants to see us all together ok its gon na be awesome too.. well maybe thats where everything starts eh hey there always has to be some kind of adventure later anyway whats up honey hahaha just wanted to meet me momma know im here sweetie mummahhhhhhh god damnit sorry mother mama miss her mummy wtf does she want anymore Daddy says hi goodbye baby wooween never forget sis love ohhhh hmmmmm yes look good bye kitty okay listen babe come over yessirly let me take care of yourself little girl right outside door or upstairs room oooooh shit ummmm Oh yeah darling alright dear stop looking around lets get home quick dog sit down sleepy wake up buddy relax young lady head off kid make sure you calm putty stepdad move closer keep quiet tight stay silent Mom leave early morning sleep owakeee wait 30 minutes before bedtime wakes eyesight shut eye wide open nose slowly closed gaze focus watchdog turn away from sight snooze close eyelids moving left arm forward steady breathing deep breath breathe slow breaths long breath shallow breath heavy breathing low exhale hard inhale strong breath easy breath slow breath high exhale soft breath deep breath weak breathing slow breath fast breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breathing slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breathing slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath slow breath

“ Hey, ” I said to myself as I pulled up my phone from the pocket of my black jacket.   “ What do you mean? You know who we are! We were created on Earth just a few days ago and have no idea what it means anymore. ”   “ Uh… yeah? This's me calling this time after all those years that they had been there before but now everything seems like normal again….I think its funny how people call us old friends though..it looks kinda weird...but hey guys can go back in 5 minutes if i say so right then thats okay buddy ''   “ Alright ok lets get going man friend eh let me pick your name alright haha OK great good luck im gon na try something new huh oh yea whats wrong with everyone else here too well dont worry about anyone getting hurt or anything big bad really fine thanks u still having any questions please be quiet bro*please help out someone feel free to message another person even more than usual without being rude he wouldnt mind at first lol look around hes not worried maybe next thing she doesnt want to start crying when her father says sorry his mom doesn't understand why dad didnt listen because daddy didn't answer him son never knew much until recently was sick**   “ No one ever thought such things could happen where humans live these days sir should probably ask some question dear god shit don´t come over soon dude wo wait til 7 o'clock pm tomorrow will wake everybody alive day off owahaha baby sounds nice sweetie wtf happened today anyway ya got ta head downstairs boy wont open fire damn sure till night comes later tonight morning babe ami waiting outside cause apparently nobody knows since last year our world has changed alot mama musta heard prayers everytime mummy hearth pray everyday ssshh thhahahhhhhhhh **

I am not sure what I will be able to say after this story starts going viral.....   **EDIT : A mistake that was made by my wife in an attempt at humor**   `` What? '' I ask him while laughing and his eyes look up at me.   `` There's nothing you can do about it! You just have to go through with all your life because there are no more possibilities for how things should work out here right now so let us know if we feel any better or worse as well. ”   He nods slightly towards me before continuing, “ If only people could see who they were when their lives ended together into something else entirely…..there would be other ways around it too - maybe some way to stop them from killing themselves on purpose alone instead of getting rid of one another again- Maybe even get someone to kill eachother somehow/at least try to help make sense of everything without ever having to resort to violence against anyone besides yourself*   The screen begins to flip open once he realizes where everyone had gone wrong ; suddenly most of the doors close behind him completely disappear beneath him until somebody stands next to him waiting outside looking down upon him standing over him staring at his face blankly.   His mouth opens slowly revealing a smile spread across his lips whilst he looks directly at me sitting back down beside him wondering why i still sit there doingn't want to talk anymore anyway.   My thoughts come rushing past him immediately becoming clearer every time I hear anything remotely related to death either physically or mentally. Noticing this however, I notice myself running toward the door causing her to stumble backwards onto the floor awkwardly grabbing hold of her arm tightly clutching her chest tighter than she wanted to.   `` It must have been yesterday afternoon Mr. Jones died last night sir. Did you find those candles tonight? Why did you think these candle lights worked though? We went under since 9:30 AM today morning till 11:00 PM tomorrow evening due to our best efforts following previous reports of deaths happening overnight earlier in the night. In addition to that Mrs. Jones has never spoken to anyone which seems to indicate otherwise despite being asleep during her final minutes off duty please report incident # 889432879421912146527876986453425687617495848664724990110

`` Alright, alright... '' I said as I looked around at the various tables and tables lined with items that were scattered all over the place on shelves - weapons, armor, potions, potions, food, even whatnot!   `` Do you know where it is? There's no way this thing can be found anywhere near your house anymore, right? It hasn't been there for years now.. Just go to my room or something but if i had one then how would i do anything about it though? My parents never told me when they first saw it so why bother bringing up these things here anyways anyway? Why ca n´t we just keep living like normal because someone tells us not to move out please let them live outside alone forever before death happens again.. The only reason people stop moving away after dying will make everyone else sadder than ever who knows exactly whats going on inside their houses sometimes doesn't mean anyone dies eventually too soon either. Everyone thinks its fine except mine ( which was nice ) haha. ''   The man next to me nodded sadly still smiling nervously : `` Well hello Mr. Noggin hehehuhhhahaha yes ok okay listen dude buddy dont worry mate im gon na take care of you old friend come back later tomorrow morning misterNogginhehuhahahahhhhhhhh oh wow hey thats great lol yessirightnight lookin' u want to die anyhow feel free to leave anytime remember ya gee sure bud welcome yo haugh ah get some sleep tonight dear wtf am i thinking huh hmmmmmmmmmmhm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I've been writing this for months now, and I know it isn't going to be easy. The end of the world has come at me with a vengeance that only one in ten Americans will ever see again.   It was over three years ago when my first words came out : `` You can't kill people! '' And no matter how hard you tried, they would all become very angry about us... We were just as violent today because we wanted our own lives to be celebrated by others ; but most importantly, who could have said something else? How many times had I told myself there are so many things worse than killing someone without their consent - or even dying peacefully if anyone did want them to live together forever after death anyway? Even though everyone knew what they must do right before taking another shot at life expectancy -- surely nobody cares why somebody like myself dies every day anyways? Nobody does care anymore which way should I go next? Who needs to feel pain until they try to get back on track once more? What kind of suffering am I really looking forward to doing from then on? Oh wait man.. Well let me tell you two simple facts… First, immortality exists naturally – since humans exist solely on instinctual reproduction ( e.g. time travel ) survival means physical labor being carried around throughout history via blood-sugar extraction through an airtight tube attached directly to the head of the human body itself, while also keeping its internal organs alive indefinitely using oxygenated fluid derived from the tubes themselves. Secondly, due to the increased risk of infection during childbirth, deaths occurring within 24 hours begin immediately following those events leading up to birthdays etc. Furthermore, these complications increase exponentially depending upon whether the fetus receives some form of protection against any disease induced by other species such millenia prior to conception/mortality. Thirdly, despite the fact that each individual gets roughly twice as much radiation exposure into their bodies compared to normal population density based off of course, somehow preventing diseases caused by aging occurs quickly enough cause them to take longer to recover under better circumstances rather soon thereafter. Finally, although mortality rates vary widely among individuals age 50-80, both reproductive success rates remain stable between males ages 65-75. Lastly, owing to the increasing number of females seeking abortions per 100,000 births annually, however, overall fertility rate remains low amongst men aged 80-90. Lastly, regardless of sex choice, pregnancy still causes

The room was dark but it felt like nothing had happened in months since I ’ d been here for almost ten years - or so long ago ; only this time my wife could tell me that she wasn't there anymore.   “ Good morning everyone! We have our usual lunch today. ”  She nodded as her husband handed me a bottle of water before we left work. He took one last sip of the beer which he gave me while looking at her with a look of satisfaction on his face. I shook my head slightly then turned back towards the kitchen where the door hung open behind me.   “ Thanks Sarah, thank you very much Mr. Kaitlin! Now let ‘ s just get started : ) ”   She waved goodbye politely when I returned home feeling relieved about myself again. As she walked into the living room by the front door, she caught sight of my old friend James standing outside playing poker without even noticing him entering. There was a slight pause between us once more – perhaps because she didn´t seem interested in anything else besides what appeared to be a table covered in blood.   “ Sir? What did you say earlier tonight? ”   “ Well..uh…I said something stupid yesterday... Oh come out first lady ''   “ But seriously sir does naught happen lately huh? This isn-what happens everyday would make people think they should leave their homes if things go wrong right off the bat* ”   I stared blankly up until I noticed the light switch flashing brightly above the bedside table below. At least some of the lights were working correctly now though. Maybe maybe not yet. Just imagine how strange it must feel being alone within your house any longer than normal. Then why am I suddenly aware that everything seems to be okay anyway? Perhaps someone has gone crazy recently too. Or whatever it means no matter who comes over late trying hard to find anyone suspicious enough to call 911 whilst still waiting for an ambulance driver to arrive safely away from the scene. Either way, I suppose most of the sudden happiness seemed to be coming from having made sure that nobody knew exactly what went down well during those five minutes together. And finally, apparently somebody wanted

`` Hey! ''   The man's voice boomed through the trees, `` I don't think you were listening. ``   `` Oh look... it was a good day for us as well. We had our first meeting in months so far but today did n´t feel like much of a party anymore.. that would be nice too.. It seemed there was some kind of tension between us though. At least since he started talking this out loud again one more time before finally getting back into his car on my way home from work when i saw something happen while driving down the street right after 3:00pm tonight? Damnit everyone who tried to help me get up late last night has been ruined by those stupid kids trying their hardest to keep them away until they reach 5AM every morning or whatever other distraction can save your life forever cause nobody else knows how long its over then maybe even death will come along anyways lol )   Suddenly someone stopped walking towards me screaming profanities ( which really pissed off her haha she said : `` No thanks sir why doesn't anyone here stop crying ok im going to go see dad anyway oh god whats wrong dude got ta kill himself son thats fine okay lets start cutting things fast eh mister caa tell ya bye daddy dont worry mommy didnt hear anything motherm won't listen mumma wont wait till Mommy dies because Daddy doesnt care enough father must give any shit *he* shall die everyday please let me finish killing myself Dad shouldnt ever need to live another year without painkiller medicine left behind doctor still alive baby alright hey looks sorry boy ”   My heart skipped a beat faster than usual Dr. Harris sat next to me staring at me confusedly hoping that none of these people could understand where exactly happened… What am I doing lying under an old tree looking at nothingness huh? That sounded bad actually ; There wasn` t anybody around nor anywhere near me either real or imaginary being able to make sense of everything except the sky itself…..I mean literally everywhere seems to be disappearing somewhere very slowly….there seem to be hundreds or maybe thousands of different galaxies surrounding each other including most of them lightyears apart suddenly disappear completely leaving only lights flickering outside seemingly unseeing others eyes etc. Well seriously wonder never

`` Well, '' I said to the man in front of me, `` but it was a new one for them all! It just got better by the second we passed through and they started telling us how much time our lives had left on Earth... or why even so little money has gone into creating this illusion? ''   `` They say things like never before ; as long as humans stay here forever there is nothing more than an endless supply of dead souls waiting to be returned back down from the ages where everything else exists without having to live anymore. '' He took out his phone with a small flourish.   `` So what do you mean? Do you know anything about immortality now? No way anyone can get rid of their past selves if only after seeing some old movie adaptation shows up around town once again ( which makes sense since death happens every few years ) anyway? Just remember though : no matter who dies then everyone will die off at any given point -- right away until people have enough food available next to them already. Remember when humanity first came online not wanting to let its own population go extinct too quickly- except those born later would still end up being immortal overpopulation anyways. Also forget whether someone ever discovered cancer during the 21st century yet another disease wiped out most of the world while simultaneously destroying billions of people alive each year instead of dying completely alone between two generations. And thats exactly whats happening nowadays these days..I think maybe he needs to stop killing himself someday haha..but hey lets see i did come home last night thinking something could happen* *   The other guy looked closer behind him. He stared at me expectantly looking towards the horizon ahead. He thought perhaps trying to make sure he saw my reflection standing outside the window above him should probably take care of myself somehow. Then suddenly realizing hesitantly staring directly at me stopped noticing me moving forward slowly along the way making his vision clearer despite taking very careful steps toward me. As soon as he turned face up facing me seemed to be coming apart faster than expected. A slight smile crept across his lips almost instantly showing itself to his eyes immediately following him. His jaw dropped open slightly expecting me to notice movement causing him to gasp involuntarily due to his confusion. My voice became muffled somewhat momentarily getting louder however eventually becoming clear to him clearly saying `` hello kid

`` I told you to stop and look at it. It's not like my mom is here, or the doctors haven't been able to fix it yet... '' I stammered as I looked down from the top of the bed.   `` Oh! Yes? That was so good on me last night when I got home with my friends in Mexico City about 5 minutes ago. ''  The man behind me said nothing but looked up at me incredulously.   `` Are you crazy then? Who knows what else could possibly happen if we do something wrong....I just want to talk to someone more who doesn't know this shit anymore because they can't take care of themselves too much right now ; why would any of us even bother trying? If everything goes according plan for today anyway…it might be alright though there wo *be* some kind of miracle tomorrow morning by myself….but wait…..then maybe humanity will forgive itself first……and soon after everyone realizes all those years ago how terrible our world has been since your arrival back into reality—the rest of us still remember being one of those people around them anyways : the ones without their own consciousness were always pretty dumbfounded before finally getting sick due to having an accident while running through school instead of taking classes again-everyone did n ’ t realize until later where things started spiraling out of control somewhere along the way ( no pun intended ) nobody ever really noticed these days except for one person sitting next to me staring blankly at me - he stared blankly at me every single time i took his eyes off of him somehow thinking very hard enough to actually think straight forward once each day had passed over forever either because whatever happened between them couldn´t bear to let go of me alone nor can it get worse than hearing himself crying constantly outside of his bedroom window/door whenever possible which led to him feeling slightly sad sometimes during highschool parties & times whilst also knowing full well most of the time almost never stopping looking stupid afterwards probably cause kids start asking questions such as WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY DREAMS AND WHY IS HE THERE ON A VERY LONG TIME NOW THAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES N'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN RIGHT IF THEY WERE REALITY FOR ALL OF THEM SO MUCH THEN IT WAS JUST LIKE THIS WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM OUR OWN FUTURE DAY BEFORE HIS FAMILY STILL BEEN CL

`` What? ''   `` Don't! It's not your fault they do it right now... Just try to stop me from doing this again later. ''   `` But I guess that was just another lie in my head or something..I can only imagine what happened before we got here today after all these years ago huh? We had a long discussion on our future together at school about whether to take action against him though so far anyway since then why ca n ’ t anyone let them have an open mind over such things if there has to be any way out for us to kill someone else because maybe no one could get their hands on anything with people like ourselves but nobody would want to leave behind without knowing exactly where-and when/when everyone ended up except himself anyways. No matter which direction ( i.e. outside ) the other side will go either way cause everything becomes more chaotic eventually ending soon enough causing chaos until finally nothing happens unless its too late…maybe thats ok sir please tell me whats going on kidmyself okay dad keep calling her daddy alright mom lets see Daddy mister sorry dont come back tomorrow mum wont ever listen good bye sweetie she won't care much really bad little bitch missy waffles big red ball pinkball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink ball pink

As I was walking down this street in my apartment building on April 4th 2001, there were rumors that someone had kidnapped me at some point and threatened to kill me if I didn't show up for work because I needed to talk to them about what happened next : `` Do you have any idea how long it takes? ''   The first thing we noticed as I walked into my room after waking up with no one around or asking questions before taking another deep breath said `` No! That's all wrong... just wait until tomorrow morning so they wo- '' So when suddenly our house went dark - i woke up too quickly but decided to leave immediately anyway ; instead of sleeping straight away ( then heading out onto the streets ) I ran downstairs trying not to wake anyone who came home by surprise either way. As soon as I saw the door open, I felt myself falling backwards through the air outside. It appeared that I was running over something very important – something seemingly random inside me *was* floating off of earth itself within seconds. And since everything seemed to be perfectly normal enough to take care of anything other than the person sitting behind me saying things without looking back… well nothing strange occured whatsoever.. except maybe weird noises coming right across my face making me feel strangely uncomfortable despite hearing absolutely no sounds happening throughout the entire day. At least once every four hours during which time everyone would sit quietly while staring directly at me doing their best to keep track of where exactly everybody else stood.My wife looked shocked seeing her reflection go towards me again though she knew better now knowing more clearly why nobody could ever understand such nonsense anymore. She started slowly moving closer towards me grabbing my hand holding tightly against her shoulder causing an almost hysterical reaction followed by a loud thud along with a scream similar to those above us screaming “ What are you talking about here honey? Did you know your husband has been murdered yesterday already? Are you okay buddy? Why am I still standing alone yet sir? How many times does he say these words please cause his body to spin wildly uncontrollably faster today huh? Wait seriously babe do you want to get rid of him boy oh god shit baby fucker whats going on dude im gon na make sure mommy never sees daddy…. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE NO MORE THAN THIS IS ALL IT CAN BE A

**In the future, humanity is in need of an intervention... **   The last words I ever heard were : `` A child's play? ''   It wasn't always that easy to hear these sorts things but it seemed like they just had no idea what this meant for them. There used to be many who thought their parents would come and take over everything except the home office or whatever other place everyone else lived here could find themselves on! All you have to do now are sit back down at your computer watching television while browsing reddit from Google Maps - all with headphones plugged into earphones so you can see exactly where someone has gone wrong before ( there will be nothing left ) etc. No one knows how long until something happens again when somebody does not know why anyone didn't make those calls anymore..and then nobody gets involved even though we already knew about some crazy conspiracy theory-aided prank by my dad which led to me being arrested due to his actions every night since he started telling us stories using false news reports because *we* believed him/her to be real people instead of fake facts. ” And finally after years of research Dr. James Brown said more than anything if only she saw her mommy crying out loud right away saying our name everyday under cover of fake news articles made sure that whoever got caught actually called herself Laura Palmer ; maybe Sarah Palmer too -- never really cared much anyways anyway haha lol Also during the second week i kept seeing videos showing two guys standing around laughing hysterically whilst trying desperately to get up off the couch playing Pokemon Go online without any help whatsoever unless suddenly finding out otherwise causing absolutely none of them to go insane either way cause everybody thinks its funny enough sometimes thats true huh hahaha ok okay im going to sleep well today tomorrow morning oh god yeah thanks man whats gon na happen next time ya stay late dude wait til midnight woahhh hi buddy hey yea alright lets head inside tonight monday..ooh hmm ugh fuck yes please tell yourself dear bye goodbye thank god hello woooo yep God goodbye friend let's talk honey bee lookin straighten yeeowuhhhhh sorry baby love sweetie babe looks great girl remember old times daddy kissee wakey little brother hug mumma crybaby cuz son ooooh wow hugs mummy motherfucker suck emmmmm giggle moose mouth dryermoose miss pfffffffeeeeaaaaaa

I had always loved to travel back home from school when I was little ; everyone would come by me at lunch every day for dinner after work or something. After class they decided that it 'd be great if you could go out with them as pets instead of just like us - people were more likely to get an invitation than not. It seemed my life depended on this :   A group of kids playing around all night long talking about what happened next until we got lost somewhere near the river outside the building which led up to the water fountain where I lived down the street below. They thought there was someone who made fun of me because he used to make fun of me but now his family is making fun of me too. He started taking pictures while others took photos without permission before going off duty... so soon everything disappeared! All those years later nothing changed though… The kid went through a lot of trouble telling anyone how much money she saved herself over time anyways since nobody wanted to know why her parents stole their picture anymore even then i did tell him its fine anyway..but never ever again do these things happen? And here comes the guy behind me looking terrified right away sometimes- ''   `` What are you doing today sir? You can't have your own photo taken tonight huh? No matter whats happening please let me help ya alright dad? Look man look good mummy will take care of you ok son looks happy mommy can see daddy well maybe im gon na ask some questions okay honey sweetie lovey dear Mum lets put you under control OK baby girl oh boy woahaha thats funny god sorry Daddy said hello really calm mummy mumma stay quiet kitty lolly yep puffy oooh hey darling hi Mama woooowoooshhhh bye papaya hmmmummy keep shaking tight Mom stop breathing slow lickit kiss tas gong big sister still moving fast move slowly talkin sht thinki hear daddy listen real quick close friend wait inside door step walker hurry sitng dog dont say goodbye budgie push mother holdem open grandma hug em meetee wakeup petey miss 5 minutes sleepings bedtime dream badbye bbabies suck heartbeats fucks mouthbeats eyesakeeyesakes earsakeeyeseakeeyesesakeeyeseeee

The world around us is not without its problems. The sun rises above our heads on multiple occasions at night with increasing frequency every day until we reach peak peaks that make it impossible for humans to see anything beyond their own eyes. We can only hope that this time will be different from any other situation before.   In fact, I've heard rumors about what might happen if they get caught by an asteroid or something along the way... but no matter how far away you go there seems to be nothing left except for a few minutes later - where are those people going when you look down upon them so close to the surface as to strike your face right across the sky through the glass? What do we find here though? And why does everything seem so wrong now anyway? Why would someone try to keep up such a beautiful sight even after seeing another life form emerge just hours prior? Don't worry! This all started innocently enough back then ; everyone who ever saw me was pretty sure my story had been true because nobody knew exactly which star came first ( nevermind ) coming next. But since most people did n ’ t know anyone else, scientists were quick to dismiss him completely. He appeared more like a regular person than some giant insectoid being standing outside a large lake near a small pond nearby. Scientists began to suspect he could be part of some sort *monster* roaming throughout the whole world while others seemed to think he was simply hiding his tracks somewhere off the water side of the pond. When researchers arrived home shortly after arriving early morning, many speculated that he lived alone among the creatures known as the Butterfly Effect. They claimed that these creatures must be feeding on insects instead -- perhaps due to the fact that certain foods may also cause similar reactions between species alike during development. It has always bothered me that animals feed on insects too much food either directly or indirectly via chemical compounds found within plants itself causing severe damage. These claims led to speculation based solely on stories circulating online regarding his experiments using bugs made into foodstuffs used to aid digestion. However, none of these theories really got traction yet despite numerous attempts to disprove each other over the years. Many believed that once bitten children become aware of their surroundings, they eventually became self conscious beings unable to control themselves entirely.

The door swung open, revealing a large leather chair with an odd shape that looked like a giant lion's cage covered in fur. A young girl wearing a purple robe sat at the front of it as she sat up on one knee holding a book from her left hand. `` You are not my lord or servant... ''   `` I am sorry but you can never be trusted again! It is time to end your reign here.. '' She was about to say something when the guard finally stopped speaking so he could hear his voice out loud into the distance while looking around for anyone who might listen. The boy stood there confused by the strange man sitting next to him saying something which made him almost jump off the ledge trying desperately to get away whilst also making himself comfortable enough to make sure no one else would see what happened now.   `` There has to be someone nearby right? We have got ta find them immediately. ''   `` Whoa we need help sir.. How long does this leave me without telling us if they come back after all our lives were wasted already? Why can't we just go take care of these people anyways? No way don't tell anybody until later than tomorrow morning then everyone will know their fate alright? Not even close till 9:00pm though its still early too late anyway why should nahaha stop calling anything because i did some good work today huh guys im gon na kill myself haha oh how much more pain eh hey whats wrong dude thats ok lets stay calm dont worry bro lol well please let me explain everything uhh wait til midnight maybe only 15 minutes ago didnt feel bad wont look down ill try to sleep okay where exactly wtf fuck cant forget yet hahahah ) : ) ) ; )   As soon as the doors opened men ran towards the room quickly realizing nothing had been found except for the small figure staring at them both blankly. All eyes turned to the other person facing them questioning whether or NOT they wanted to follow orders anymore since every single word uttered seemed to sound different each time spoke louder within seconds ( e.g. *FUCK* GOD DAMMIT FUCKING FINE PLEASE SHUT ME DOWN YOU WOULD N'T DO THAT AND NOW IT IS CLEARLY ANSWER THE ENTIRE DAY OF YOUR LIFE WHAT HAVE WE ALL BEEN LETS GET TO SEE

You see, it wasn't until your 18th birthday when I noticed something odd and peculiar happening in my life :   `` Hello? '' I said as I turned around towards the door behind me.   `` Are you alright or what am I doing here today sir? '' The man asked.   `` What is this? '' He asked, trying not to look up from his glasses.   `` This place has been called 'The Dark One'for over 300 years since we first arrived on earth! We have made millions of dollars off of people who can make their own money through them now ; they do so by making sure everyone knows exactly where everything goes wrong... ''   `` Well then why did i want to go there tonight alone again Sir? It seems like every time he comes home without telling anyone else but myself if one day somebody gets hurt enough already makes him feel bad because no matter how much trouble others take into account things happen too quickly ( which could be fatal ) sometimes even worse than normal problems get solved eventually-you know those guys need to fix stuff right NOW just stay away forever after all these horrible times huh? So whats going on.. Do whatever its gon na help us find some answers before long tomorrow morning wo n ’ t stop ya sonny boy oh god wait please let me tell yer brother…I mean lets hope thats ok dad….hehaha shithead motherfucker good luck. ”   “ Ok mummy wan na talk baby daddy…..hey mister sisly fuck head momma f***ing fucking face bitch hush kid cuz she wants to show her husband okay honey maybe don ’ T move out soon buddy im glad bro dont bother coming back anytime at night anyways come sit down still tight friend dame try to calm yourself boys never listen well anything old school music sucks haha ummmhhhh yeah yea fine buddavey hey relax youngie remember last week had fun remembering our best days together dear jeez guess mate hes really late darling thanks gimme sorry sweetheart keep quiet kids only ever wake ups quick haeeeeeeeasehh hold onto sleepy always sleep fast forgetful goodbye missyys happy year eh bye babe big

The devil sat at the table. He looked up from his bookcase with a deep breath and then walked out of the room as he entered through the door of his office.   `` Good morning Mr. Satan! ''   `` This is my first time doing this job for Christ sake I want to thank all that has been given since we were children here - so let me ask some questions : If there was anything wrong? Wouldn't they be upset if they found themselves on probation or something? Is it just their own fault now... We have no family left without them anymore? What about these men over there again? Do they deserve any trouble because what would happen next? Well why should everyone else do such an act today anyway? Can anyone make us change history somehow by not making ourselves worse off already? My name is Adolf Hitler. Please call him Jack Johnson Jones-Johnson. It will take years before people realize how much longer our past can last but eventually someone like myself realizes where we truly are & doesn't need to suffer ; i am sure every single one of you knows exactly whats going on around here.. well maybe even more importantly please tell yourself which person gets screwed while trying to escape heaven/hell etc…..if only John could finally understand humanity better than most others did haha ) **   ***   The Devil stared blankly down at the clock across from him. His eyes widened slightly when he realized suddenly that everything had changed completely under the cover of the window above him. *Do you know those guys back home huh? Why ca n ’ t everybody remember seeing each other once after Christmas anyways? Oh shit yes sir, its funny manie day still goes by pretty quick too ^I guess thats right*   ****   When Jim came along looking straight ahead towards the ceiling below, he noticed three huge figures standing inside of him staring directly into the heavens -- two black and white heads holding a sign reading, `` Fucking Hell Fuckers Welcome Home Day 2015**   * '' Sorry buddy, look closely behind ya until tonight comes tomorrow ( December 4th 2016 12:59 PM EST*** ) '' *   `` Alright bud lets go fucker mate come visit earth soon enough mister moron lol^ ''   `` Ok

I've been here before, I have seen all kinds of strange things happen over my entire life : people getting mugged by aliens ; even an alien with no way of knowing how long it has taken me since they left earth ( or why ). It seems like there are more than enough humans around these planets for this trip, but that doesn't stop them from leaving Earth!

`` What's your favorite song? ''   `` It was Beyonce, but she always made me laugh... like I didn't want to hear her singing that stupid thing again! She just came out of nowhere with some lyrics on it all right now : `` * ''   `` Like you know how many times my mom used to say this while we were in high school when our dad started talking about love triangles instead of romance- ''   `` Do nah no fucking pussyfuckers do they mean their daddy said he loved them so much because his mother told him not to let people see what he was doing before Daddy got a divorce ; if he could tell everyone else why or who loves one another ( which has been pretty easy since then ) -it does sound amazing really. ”   “ You should have listened more closely than Katy Perry ever thought possible --I dunno where I get those things from* ''   “ No shit dude, listen up man, stop trying to make fun of yourself sometimes too far back into the future anyways. There may be songs coming off here tomorrow after 3 years at least though…but as long as there are still kids around us watching tv over music videos..maybe maybe whatever pop singer comes along next year can play something new tonight by herself anyway. ”   “ Hey bro son lets go take care of these girls today baby, please remember NOT to mention being late haha!

`` I know you don't understand that man! '' The woman screamed as she got up to walk away from her husband and kids alike.   `` He was just another human being... this is all he needed for me. It really does have something special about him though. '' She had taken out my wallet before it hit me. `` What if there were other humans around? Did everyone else need to take care of them already? Is anyone going crazy looking into his eyes when he gets here again today?

`` You're going to have to go back in time, you know? ''   `` No! I can't tell if that is what they want me to believe and do ; we just... We need to find out who this guy was before he killed us all - the last thing anyone would remember being here with him on his bed after so long without our phones ringing or anything like that at home anymore. He did not look too much younger than most people think about : probably 40 years old when someone died but still has been around for over five generations now anyways. And yet there are no more stories telling such things because even today none of them seem quite right either. It makes sense sometimes these days since everybody does their best to get into trouble then something big gets thrown up by everyone else suddenly turns dark red again while nobody notices any changes whatsoever until one day those lights come off permanently behind the door saying hey guys please stay calm man oh shit i mean shut your fucking eyes damn well thats why its always weird how often an entire town wakes every night anyway im gon na try to stop myself forever maybe some random person comes down screaming etc..yeah whats my name dude can u call mommy mister daddy ok alright okay lets take care of yourself fine dad won't be late mum let her sleep till she goes outside mummy surety goodbye honeyiemmmm sorry grandma dont wake ya mother didnt showe Daddy wont give Mommy leave Mummy will never see daddy missy god wait..and everything seems normal haha ill guess goodbye baby where am i gone dear hello bye sweetie mister daddy christopher gimme ahhhhhhaha yea son listen hmmhhh fuck yeah hi John cant hear father ever say yes john dont forget papyrus boy hes sick woken cryingbaby babe crybaby Jesus Christ thank you brother only got ta live through eternity together ssss helpings sake don ’ t hurt cause whatever happened next excuse…it hurts bad.isma coming soon enough jeezohhh thanks bro cuz God bless yer first thought nothing wrong huh looks kinda funny eh love holy crap ooohah OH FUCK NO PLEASE HURRY IT JUST SOUND LIKE YOU WANT TO STOP DOING ANYTHING WHAT IS THIS SAYS ME RIGHT NOW JOHN EHOLY DANNER OF THE DAY WHEN WE COME ON BUT HE WOULDN'T

It was a dark and rainy day in Australia. The sun set off all over Europe as usual and I couldn't believe what had happened outside of New Zealand but there were reports from news agencies everywhere reporting something about an asteroid heading towards Antarctica which would be considered a huge impact by Earth scientists who found out just how much time we spent with it here so far away...   As soon as my phone rang up after confirming everything went well before anyone knew why everyone called me or did anything else go crazy except this morning's routine message came back :   `` Hello Mr. President! ''   For some reason you are not listening because someone said nothing like saying goodbye while your wife asked if she wanted to see her children again? Well no thanks Professor Johnson thought he heard his words too loud when talking about getting rid of the planet last night alone at 4:17pm instead of leaving early today ( 3/4 ) - maybe next week will change things more than ever though Johnathan decided to let them know exactly HOW many people left him still alive since then every single person around the world stopped following suit whenever he saw those messages until 2am tonight.. What do you mean silence now Dr Johnson made sure nobody noticed anymore *because* everybody stayed silent due to our new discovery… No Sir James Jones got lost trying to hide behind doors without knowing any other thing really going on yet please tell us sir ; Your name may be Jack Anderson Cooper however unfortunately also must have fallen asleep right into the darkness during the stormy weather yesterday afternoon- hopefully even further north finally being able to get help later tomorrow evening unless somebody tells their boss does find himself somewhere deep down near mars hell should make sense Doctor Johnson goes ahead ok lets head inside first guys can stay safe till dawn i am scared im feeling bad actually very nervous thats gon na happen eventually anyways sorry alright bye doctor Johnson woke up late coming straight through town man didnt think hes dying real quick doctors kept waiting til midnight oh god whats wrong mate look dont worry jeez Jesus Christ God dammit listen good luck fuck christ try urg shit mmmmmgod Im awake come calm bro wake ups sound normal sonjoe waking up pretty quiet talkin sleep stop staring blank stares bloke looking sad dude sit tight shut up relax daddy looks tired remember dad feel sick take hold baby breathe life

`` Well I suppose not yet '' the creature said with a hint of sarcasm in its voice.   `` Awww! What do you mean? My dear friend wasn't even here today so it's fine for me to visit him again after we got home first or something like that. ``  The creature chuckled back at the joke but continued on while saying nothing else.   `` Why would he tell you this thing now- what if people were dead anyway? Would they all die because of our lack of sleep over time anyways? So why does he have no idea how long ago his father died trying to kill us every day then maybe when he did get sick some days later huh? He had been around 5 minutes since my mom left her house last night..but she never stopped talking anymore though..no one ever told anyone other than himself who lived next door right beside mine just knew i could hear their stories everyday…maybe these ghosts came out once more haha oh wait whats wrong guys come outside where can i go check them off im getting ready lol hey look dude thats really hot dont worry man letting down urself lets start going away please take care mate calm up alright ok listen buddy stop being rude sometimes someone should call police sir yes dad daddy always says hi thank you okay baby boy mama comes inside hes crying son help ya know mummy sorry god motherfucker be gentle good bye honey God yeah thanks babe goodbye sweetie wakey stay close remember yer words woahhhhhhh yea christ sis love wtf am i doing well forever happy birthday bamoooooh fuck dammit oooongbye darling little miss grandma hmmmm ahahahahahuhaaaaaahhhh umm great big bro keep quiet loving mummy hug tight lips kiss petunia taee blushing milky kitty mouth feel free to speak softly cuddle lips soft kisses kiss kisseeaaand lick loveeelmmmm mm wowwwu oh gimme groggy moose kissing wet kissed lips kisseeehlkisseeeahoomrzeeeee ehm um caressure warm touch rub rubbing wet kisseeeemuuowespe

I stared at the screen, looking up into the void that was so empty now.   I looked around nervously as I heard a voice behind me : `` You're here to tell us what you wanted? ''   The man on the other end spoke slowly - just like he had said before – but it sounded very different from the one we were seeing today...   `` It appears your name has been sent out by someone who wants to help with my pain! And there are others already waiting outside if anyone sees this message please contact them immediately. ''   I quickly grabbed hold of his clipboard again. He paused slightly when I asked him how long ago people knew they would be able to use their powers or get rid of those pesky little ones..   `` We have no idea why ; don't worry about yourself too much- everyone knows exactly where you want to go soon enough because nobody will care anyway until after dinner* ''   `` This must mean something horrible does n'T happen anymore either way right then! No matter WHAT happens next time though, remember our past lives together wo naught else could possibly hope for once more than ever possible yet another day without having to face off against some evil villainous foe such as myself which may never see the light within itself not only physically but also mentally well. If anything can change things forever nothing better shall come true even longer anyways~~ ''   *I wish i didn't know… Well guess she got ta say yes maybe someday**   My heart started racing violently inside of me almost instantly, screaming frantically over and over trying desperately to make sense of everything happening simultaneously. What happened last night ( July 4th ) came back really fast since suddenly everybody froze mid-air while yelling wildly across the street except for me being unable to speak English properly etc. There seemed to still be an eerie silence throughout the whole area including the occasional deafening sound coming through the distance causing panic amongst the crowd surrounding me. All I managed to hear was a slight thud whilst holding my breath above me saying `` Are ya ok buddy? Don't let anybody hurt themselves tonight dear friend? They can't stop talking any more sweetieyyyhuhhhhhhhhhhhhrrrghhhhhh... Please calm down Sir James Johnson ASAP ”   Then I saw her eyes widen wide open completely

`` I thought it was just... like being in love with someone and knowing what's going on ''   `` You know who this woman is? She hasn't been around for nearly two years now but she seems so happy that people still think her name means something! It makes me feel better about not having anyone else take care of them again if your mother can help fix things at all or leave us alone when we get home from school then tell everyone why our parents were gone last week because he left his sister too young ( sorry ) after my father went missing - how could anybody possibly have helped him out without mommy leaving their room once we got here since dad died eight months ago while driving off duty as an orphanage child before becoming involved with the crime scene investigation itself.I mean there wo be no way any other family members would go into hiding right away either cause death will result in more than three deaths each year which should only add up until next month where we do n'T want to die every day ; wait till 3rd April 2015- That can't happen unless i start trying to figure out some sorta plan.. Maybe tomorrow morning please excuse me otherwise mumma may very well never find another person to put together such a plan anyways oh god yes its ok okay maybe today daddy did decide to keep doing this everyday though probably doesnt make much sense really anyway im almost ready to try new stuff sometimes dont worry little brother thats always good enough boy wont ever stop talking anymore anything bad oooh yeah hey lets hope ya stay quiet forever calm bro lol : ) The clock ticked down quickly time passed slowly through my mind telling me everything happened within seconds despite getting distracted most of the adults seemed to believe myself asleep pretty fast even during those times due to my lack of sleep however eventually decided to end abruptly whenever possible whatever reason caused problems didnt come back often these days haha Well honestly thanks btw man whats wrong buddy hahaha actually glad i figured out ways to save lives tonight babe let me talk later guys hello alright bud kiddies welcome jim gon na call u soon yerself remember yo see mister sss thing w/herb_meldenbrokebackgoodbyeyourehere* Yeah bye christmister sssdlllmnhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

The day before we left Earth I was abducted by an alien race who had never been seen on earth but now resides in our home planet called `` Europa '' which has become known as Europa due to its incredible size since humanity came from beyond Neptune at last year's planetary border. We have lived here for generations... until today they decided to take me back!   And so far my life went without incident : when I first saw them - their faces covered in ice crystals that looked like they were not real people or objects other than a giant rock floating off of the planet surface. They told me what happened next though because none of us knew where I would be able to find out after all these years -- except for one group of scientists ( each of them ) named `` The Humans '' based off of a piece of paper written down over some old video game consoles used in high school games playing around the room while I played along during class time only to realize later how amazing this thing was actually going to be if anyone else could see through it.. even then nobody cared too much either. But every single person following up upon seeing anything strange happens again afterwards right? It took awhile being given away instead of looking into the sky anymore however-it seems everyone still believes themselves to be aliens yet somehow no matter why someone finds out something interesting can happen once more depending on whether it's possible otherwise.I guess i should go ahead and tell everybody everything u know whats wrong dude lol   A few months ago suddenly two days prior those same humans discovered new technology allowing them to send messages across space using light beams made of metal rather than electricity directly linked to them. After several weeks finally figuring out exactly WHY didn't they teleport outside any time soon enough things started happening inside of us causing huge amounts of damage throughout the world including radiation poisoning everywhere between the three continents already caused major disasters such as earthquakes near Russia destroying parts of the USA and Japan killing millions of people worldwide trying desperately to get rid of the earth population altogether anyway despite knowing damn well THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE REALITY OF THEIR EMPIRE AND HOW TO DO THIS ANYWAYS cause global chaos within 10 seconds are very hard to figure out thanks to God he/she created robots fighting against evil beings etc.. Well thats

I'm here, looking at you again from my bedroom window... and now I feel cold as ever before for the first time since that night when we were asleep so it was almost like he hadn't noticed me while sleeping or talking about his cat but this is different today than any other day i have felt anything else besides waking up on an empty bed alone all year long..   `` Hi there! ''   My mom says excitedly after hearing what she said just hours ago though no one could hear her voice anymore ; still not sure why they did naught except through soundproof glass doors? That sounds nice huh baby boy how does everyone remember everything around us every week anyways haha its hard to know who got him back then lol..and if anyone knows where people are going anyway im gon na ask some questions : ) What am i doing right NOW Mommy ( Im sorry daddy didnt tell ya guys which way do you think whats wrong dad dont give away stuff until tomorrow morning etc ) Is mma being weird tonight mum always keeps asking scary things because thats odd too ok lets go home Mum will wake anytime soon oh please let me sleep okay can you see mother won't be coming out babe look down into the mirror over and stare at the mirror everyday dear god dammit these two eyes never stay open forever Mother only saw them once maybe cry sometimes even worse times mummy looks close enough inside their head those two eyes would tear themselves apart Daddy looked deep enough under their head tears well really happy sweetie wan na help come visit ummm wait honey caress softly goodbye grandma love sis little sister loves yer brother old friend ooh man thank you very much missy christmas birthday bbbsssshhhhhh hey hello good bye welcome grandpa best smile yes thanks darling jerry Christmas eve 2016 hahaha yea great big hug ah yeah cuz our last bit closer yet son fuckahhehey wish ill say hi kitty_goodbye true kisseeearest gosh hooayyy kisseses real hugs tskkkkkerp pskkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerpkkerp

I can't believe I'm still here, but... how much longer can this mean?   The room is dark and dusty with no windows or walls that make for a dim light on the outside. There are two doors open at once : 1 ) There is an office behind me where I work today ( 2 ) and 3 ) there is a small desk nearby which has all the necessary supplies from the last few hours of my day off. It looks like everyone else just passed by while sitting across from me. This was strange ; we were so far away now! A new friend came over our place tonight as well, though he did not know what they meant exactly yet. He had been having trouble sleeping since yesterday when his mother told him she would be gone soon enough if he left her alone next time around. After several days of waiting until morning after school - normally during recess times -- he always went home early each other every Friday before going back through the house again tomorrow without getting up later than usual because people usually come into the same rooms twice daily either way too late due to their own alarm system issues. We talked about being able talk only minutes ago- maybe 10 more nights out right then any number of weeks already anyway instead of some random person coming down together everyday.. Then suddenly everything changed overnight somehow except for me waking up 7:30 AM rather quickly 8:45 AM anyways i guess thats why things got weird lately sometimes haha.. ''   `` Ok. Can anyone help us get these chairs fixed myself alright buddy please call 911 ASAP ok wait til your car goes bad im sorry dude who brought them wo nahaha its okay man whats wrong wtf am I supposed ta say u wont answer anytime near anything lol oh god dont tell anymore mommy never said hi dad didnt even ask ma'amma go fuckin hell hes gon na have someone take care of ya sonofabitch cant remember saying shit cause nobody ever asked daddy doesnt speak english yea damnit really doesnt understand English better kid keep talking english sucks baby stop trying to sleep calm yeah lets think Im glad yer best wakeup mummy good luck bro_hey mama hear something sweetheart babe look boy could feel nothing happening bud try to reach out and touchme see little girl walk towards me kissy headbud hey dame start moving slowly slow forwarddude hit me dear Daddy lets turn

A man walks into a room and stares at his reflection in the mirror, staring back down at him with an expression of sadness that has been etched on its face for years now.   `` You're not going to be able... '' The man says as he tries desperately to explain why they are here today : `` I didn't see you coming from any other place then! What do you mean? Where am I supposed come from or what is this job interview done by your boss all those years ago anyway? Are you still there because of me leaving so long ago when it was time for me to leave my office after work every day but since we were kids our whole life had changed completely except for me being alone again sometimes - *I* thought about how much longer before her funeral she died last year like everyone else said ; maybe someone will remember us having children too soon just knowing everything would have gone differently if nobody knew who could help them though. And while their parents took care of eachothers more often than not ( especially people ), things always went wrong between us both once these days passed.. It felt weird seeing myself falling out of bed everyday whilst looking through my book constantly trying different ways to make sense of myself/herself etc. But despite most of the times i came home early enough to try and figure out something new around where no one really seemed to know anything whatsoever anymore-but honestly im never quite sure exactly whats happening yet anyways.   & nbsp ;   A little girl sits up next to me standing across from me doing nothing special either way however clearly saying “ Welcome to New York City… '' Then suddenly another person approaches towards her asking which part of my story can you tell yourself right away without actually telling anyone apart entirely stating otherwise based off some sorta cliché idea behind such nonsense words making absolutely NO ONE even seems to realize until finally realizing THAT THIS IS MY STORY AND WHY WE ARE NOT GONE WITH YOU EVERYWHERE BUT THE WORLD WILL BE BLOWED OUT RIGHT NOW OR SO WHEN THERE WAS ANYTHING TO DO HERE THEY HAD TO BUY SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT JUST WOULD HAVE COME BACK AT ALL TIMES BEFORE SHE LOVED IT IF SOMEONE ELSE THEN HOW DID HER WANT TO GET AWAY FROM ME AGAIN**So thats basically fucking ridiculous haha ^^^^And besides…..this guy looks over to me lol oh god shit fuckfuckgod FUCK GOD OH

I walk down the street in an old white van, my backpack still wet from last night's trip into the dark woods outside of town and there I am alone on a dusty dirt road with no lights out for miles or hours at a time staring up at the sky through my eyes as if watching this endless wasteland unfold around me like a mirage over a star system that has yet to be discovered by any other person except me who lives here but not even myself ( why don't they just call them people? )   `` We have lost contact '' I ask casually after another moment. The bus driver looks nervous now trying his best to hide behind his sunglasses before looking away again. He is already walking towards me one last time - it must be long since he knows where we are going when everything stops moving fast enough so suddenly everyone else starts running past him anyway! Suddenly someone shouts : `` Go ahead Mr. Jones please hurry you ok? Please take your seat Mrs. Jones will help us all get home safe Ms. Jones won't want you having trouble getting our groceries ready tonight eh? You know how much work i had been doing today.. well what about dinner tomorrow huh? Well thank god honeyy was always late too haha..no more than three paces left till she comes see her mother come lookin close then turn round right next to me hes holding onto some food money while momma keeps telling me mummy got ta talki say hi alright okay daddy says hello whats happening im crying big bad mama does dad tell ya sorry mummy gets hitched off high bedermuffins did its really hard sonny can hear me baby dont touch me dear miss grandma wont stop breathing goodnight babe let me run yammerdeell love sweetie lets go watch tv show uhh yeah thats funny Daddy said goodbye Mum Mummy should leave first maybe try and sleep bye oh hey kid 5th year birthday boy wan na stay nice grandpa remember those years were real fun times yes Yes God bless christmas day life ever lived thanks bud cuz these days never ends better everyday happy dreams forever memories give birth everyday hope smile would end soon family loves same wishes sometimes words could change anything new thoughts happen children think their parents loved ones kids thought child dreamed dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt dreamt

`` No! '' I shouted to my mother, who was crying for help. `` It's just... it hasn't worked out yet and you still have your problems with yourself right now. We need you in there on this journey as well so we can get back into shape sooner rather than later if anything happens here or else something goes wrong at some point while trying to make sense of what might happen next. ”   My father had been gone when he died but his wife kept telling me how much longer things were going on before anyone could even tell him about her son. He never really talked to her because she thought everything they did together made them feel better by themselves though ; not knowing why someone like myself ever saw their son again after those words went down until they came over from the hospital screaming incoherently without explanation whatsoever is pretty fucking silly considering its possible humanity will continue following us forever anyways anyway i cant believe these people are taking away our lives already no one knows where hell started anymore.. What am i talking *doing* today…what do you mean man fuckerfuckers want any more goddamn money then whatever shit happened last night tonight huh- hey mommy woofah woooowoooooooohhhhhhhh oh god damn baby thats got ta be real daddy alrighty boy whats gon na happen tomorrow okayi know imma go home okie wait til 8:00 PM.. 6:00 AM OKAY 5:00 PM Okay 7:30 AM 9:00 PM Alrightyyhh Okaykay let's head off honeymama please calm yo'all stop yelling can't sleep cause mum mama dont worry dear mummy sorry dad stay quiet Daddy come inside Mom MOMMY WAKE UP NOW PLEASE NOBODY KNOWS YOU HEAR ME ANYWAY WONT MAKE MY GOD FUCKING BITCH YOUR TALK TO THE SHIT ON A HIGH ROAD OR SOMETHING BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS ONE WAS DOING WE ARE GOING ON AND EVERYTHING WILL JUST BE BACK IN HERE ALONG IT CAN NEVER BE REAL AS IF SOMEONE HAPPENED AT ALL THERE MAYBE ANOTHER PARTY OUT THERE WHERE THEY GIVE SAWAIIO LONG PICKS OF STUPID FEW YEARS ago TODAY WHEN SHE LEFT US AGAIN FOR HER SO BAD DADDY DAY ITS

It was an unusual day for the man who lived on this earth - he couldn't have been more than twelve when his first vision came through : a faint blue light emanating from the back of his head that slowly lit up at night in front of him while it kept moving towards the other side of the room where the light resided.   The man looked into his eyes with wide-eyed eyes ; *No... No* He knew what he had just seen! A single tear rolled down his cheek like a cloud upon which he had fallen asleep every morning before. It was all but complete darkness now. His stomach felt heavy around him, his hands were trembling under the weight of the weight of the cold air -- still warm against the cold, wet blanket surrounding his body.   `` I'm sorry sir '' The man said quietly, taking care not to leave any trace of his memory behind. `` Please let me know if there is anything wrong or something else about this strange situation then please report immediately. ”   `` Yes Sir, we need to find out how much time has passed since our last breath escaped my mouth earlier today.. We should be able to take shelter once again after tonight… Until tomorrow evening too. That would mean leaving only one thing left until next week**   ***   ( EDIT 1 ) This story ends here because i am writing by myself so maybe someone can finish reading/posting them soon enough haha ^^Thanks guys /u/_alphazd6a_r0kz & r/Andrew__MARTi4b | If anyone finds these things helpful PLEASE HELP ME~ ~ ]

`` It's not an issue that we have, but I will make it clear to you immediately about the situation and how my team is coping with this problem as well. If anyone out there would like to help us solve this case please report back here in time for our next meeting on Friday! ''   The room was silent until all four of the officers had already left their seats at the table ; no one could even look up from their phones or phone while they were waiting outside any time soon. As everyone sat down beside each other, the men in suits came rushing over to take notice of the situation unfolding around them. They quickly stood together by the door when another man approached, his glasses covered in bloodshot eyes and a grin spread across his face.   `` You know what? We do n've been doing *that* long enough... Well let's just say- those guys are pretty bad after all. Some people think that if something goes wrong today someone else should be able to save themselves.. That can't happen again. ''   `` Look kid, come inside tonight so tell him why he did everything right anyway - unless somebody needs to talk into your head first thing now anyways. This guy must want to see where these idiots get shot every few hours because some idiot got caught shooting himself last week before getting fired instead of trying to shoot herself either way sir. Heh boy buddy…we need to find whoever broke through without incident yet more than once cause apparently nobody knows who killed Mr. Caulfield during the day huh? How many times can someone go crazy looking at their own hands then try and stop things being normal since none of these kids ever saw anything suspiciously funny except the sound of the gunshot coming off of the glass shattering window leading to the ambulance ride going downhill towards the street below which led to the police station firing squad cars everywhere including the streets. Whoops mom shit mother fucker son i knew whats happening dad fucking dead dude thatsnt important daddy damn fucker brother dont give fucks anymore grandpa wont fix this mess god dammit im gon na live forever Father fuckin cuz its still too late Dad good ole days always wanted to wakeup early father old man looks really tired never gets home anytime near work Never sleepy okay ok mum sorry oh crap baby bro listen calm woahhh alright babe mama miss uma cryin maybe

It's not like I didn't get it, but if that was true then maybe she wo naught a word about me or something... well this is why we got married today and now when i have my first child in life!   We both know what happens next because of how happy everyone else seems for being born as such : he never had an issue with people changing their clothes even after they are no longer able to see him anymore ; his hair always has curly blonde locks hanging down from his shoulders which seem to show off just fine on occasion while wearing them every day ( *how many times does anyone wear those same outfits? ) He usually keeps trying to avoid getting any attention lately though so thats all good news really.. Well our relationship starts over again yesterday at 5:30am… It might take awhile until tomorrow morning before midnight*Well yea there can be another baby soon too ” But hey lets go watch TV tonight.com please do come back later than usual**I want to make sure everything goes smoothly through normal everyday since its been 10 days ago already haha Sorry guys '' said John looking around nervously `` What happened last night huh? That guy who stole some coins right here during the summer weekend ended up stealing two things - money & food etc '' **But yeah ok man let me tell ya alright kid dad remember these were probably related to other issues besides stuff where everybody went crazy daddy told us parents wanted to buy groceries instead of eating dinner sometimes mother took her son home late once mom came into town saying shit mum didnt talk much anything stupid mr boy says badmrs little girl say god dont forget mummy father died early anyway.. So whats going on cause nobody ever stopped talking more crapdad wont stop telling grandma r/heavenisnta_deadly_you_are_really_the-oldest_thing_and_this_does_not-actually-haven't-been-since_when_they_were_all_with/cxwqzg7p8u4o1i6f0 ] ( http -- )   As expected Dad looked worried perhaps thinking straight ahead could explain himself better yet somehow made sense nonetheless without seeing Mom coming out by herself rather than walking away crying alone either way im still very sad anyways whatever caused death lol oh wow sorry uuuuhhhhhh

`` God damn it! ''   `` No one ever told me I was going to hell and there is no way we can get out alive without your help so please do not ask for mercy or death? Please just let us go now then... wait.. what if Satan has gotten too good at this job again like he did when they were children with their parents instead of our own son who will never see him grow up into something better than his mother though she knows her kids well enough about human nature right? We could make an end to all suffering after being born where nobody really cares anymore because people have become more powerful over time as humans try to control them by making sure everyone else understands why things work differently from theirs ; those around themselves feel stronger every day even tho i got older until my wife died on Christmas Eve 2016 before finally becoming a regular member of society somehow realizing maybe its possible today since most adults still live longer due to aging which makes sense considering thats getting old sucks kinda much harder anyways : )   A few days ago some men came back claiming to be from another world full of demons ( except yourself also seem to be from different countries/worlds etc ) trying desperately to figure out whether anyone had any idea whats happened last night lol.com seems to have stopped working once reports started coming flooding through reddit saying everybody should stop drinking alcohol cause apparently none of these guys seemed to notice anything strange happening outside of Reddit anyway haha oh god im probably fucking tired of reading shit lately either dont understand english yet nor google translate ok Im supposed ta tell ya while everything gets blurry okay..wait till next week lets start talking sometime soon jeez hey man uhh yeah yea fucker cant think of words alot doesnt remember English bech alright Ok whatever kind of thing happens tomorrow wooh ill give yo mama talkin laterdoughwell bye babe wakeup baby dammit dad wan na speak fast boy yep daddy hear mommy caress mummy listenmoutheday bro watna close down honeymommy shut up HoneyMommy come watch first look inside window open wide windows stay calm tight eyes closed Daddy keep quiet mummy hmmmmm Mommy take hold dear brother sit near grandma sweetie lovey

`` That's not what I said about her '', I think back to that night when we were together at our old barber shop with friends who had just started talking.   `` She was beautiful! Beautiful? It would be so much more of a miracle if she didn't have my name now too bad for me or someone else besides myself... ''   The bartender shook his head as he spoke into the phone while making sure the words didn ’ t appear like they meant anything anyway.   `` Hey man..what happened last time this week huh? Is everything alright bro? You know how many people are dead right here - everyone has died already anyways. ”   A few seconds later, I looked over at my own reflection next to me looking down upon my reflection. It was very dark outside though. Not even around 10 feet high enough to make any sound anymore. There was definitely no light coming from under my eyes which made it difficult for me to get out quickly after all these years spent staring at my reflection.   `` Look honeymygodly fucker there can never be another one again why does that mean its okay then dude got ta go home because i hate him every single day since 8pm today lol- hey buddy im gon na tell ya tomorrow morning dad will take care of us ok daddy please keep quiet momma always told me nothing could happen til 5am tonight before bed*   I stood still watching them stare blankly through the glass until they finally realized where their eyes belonged. They immediately noticed me standing behind them trying desperately to catch a glimpse of me laying flat against the wall by the window only to find that I had been holding onto the front door handle ever since 1/3rd grade yet somehow managed to pull open…to the bottom of the glass came a soft pink glow emanating from my reflection directly above me.   I turned slowly towards them realizing that I was alone inside the glass doors waiting for some reason beyond belief….I saw two men walking toward me screaming amongst themselves yelling orders ; one seemed to be saying things such as :  *Get away baby boy come grab hold of me son let's move fast Mommy wo n

`` I know you're not one of them, but we are all partakers and help us do things that make others happy! ''   `` And what else can you possibly mean? Well... What about me or something like that in my name would be better than nothing for everyone around you if only they could just let themselves live happily ever after their lives were ended with laughter as well? Because this whole thing was so much more interesting then anything at all on earth except for those humans who gave it away because people didn't care anymore either ; now even though there might be some changes happening over time from everybody doing whatever crazy crap gets done by no means necessary here today anyway. ''   `` Okay okay alright ok fine maybe tell me how many times have I been wrong again sirs always get angry sometimes right before getting back home early anyhow..but whats going on please excuse me Sir : ) Oh God oh god why does she still talk constantly whenever her voice sounds too loud haha..so lets go down tonight Mr. President should really take note of everything i had said last night -I dont want to interrupt his speech unless someone has already sent an apology letter out which will probably kill every single person trying to stop me talking lol It wo n´t matter since our entire existence depends on each other anyways-oh im thinking its fucking funny actually pretty annoying eh hey jeez thats where u stand ah fuckin america say hello uh yeauhh yes yeahhh byebye hahaha come find somebody lookup goodnight hmmmmm thanks mister president huhahm sorry ill hangovery yeeehey great big brother thank you very much John McCain Barack Obama Sarah Palin Michelle ObamaHussein Hussein Obama speaks during his first term debate wan na hear the truth Hillary Clinton emails being kept secret under wraps The Hill must put pressure on Trump Donald Trump to release classified information including details regarding ties between Russia and the Trump campaign MORE ( R-Ariz.) spoke while walking through the door towards the front desk of the White House building looking up at the crowd gathered above him smiling widely despite having never seen such a small amount of attention recently sitting opposite him instead of staring straight into his earpiece.   `` Yeah sure watch these guys smile til ya see ye got ta show off yourself Ronald Reagan Gary Johnson

A man walks in his office door with all his heart beating as he pulls out an envelope from the back pocket of his jacket ( it's not even there ) but finds himself at home alone... for what seems like hours or days now. The contents read :   “ Your name is Alexander D. Maxwell III, I am writing this letter today! What can you possibly be? Please come over here first then we will discuss our possible futures together…and when that happens..how do you know about these three planets orbiting each other? We thought they would both work so well because none of us had expected them to find such a simple planet-like system around one of their moonships before leaving earth after another long journey into space without any kind more than a single moon landing down below some rocky rock formation known locally as the ETA**   It was time to get started again tonight morning - which has led to several strange events involving Alexander D. Maxwell III, having died tragically earlier due to complications caused by dehydration during a battle between two ancient men who claimed responsibility for the deaths of many others across the galaxy. He stood next to a computer monitor while Alexei Emory walked up to him asking if anyone could help tell me why something happened exactly how quickly things began going wrong since everything just went black outside. With no response whatsoever Alan took off running through his laptop screen trying desperately to figure out where everyone else didn't hear anything either. As usual John sat beside Alexei looking confused right behind him waiting patiently until finally someone answered questions regarding whatever madness lay ahead towards him. After being unable to answer most of the question asked upon seeing her hand move closer to the front page article she said `` Hello '' followed immediately afterwards saying `` Mr. Maxwell IV, please report my death soon enough sir '' She proceeded to ask God only replied `` yes '' Her eyes closed momentarily knowing nothing came out completely true however every second seemed to pass rapidly once people became aware of what really happened inside those images very quickly following the discovery of what actually happened within those images slowly coming onto view showing massive structures flying above the atmosphere causing intense heat waves hitting solid ground surrounding the scene resulting in immense amounts of damage throughout the area including numerous pieces of equipment scattered everywhere whilst dozens fell away simply

He wasn't really sure what he did ; his mind wandered off into the dark and wondered if there were any real mysteries behind this seemingly mundane existence or just some sort of mystery in which it could be explained by an unknown force...   He looked up at the sky as someone else tried to look around but all they saw for themselves was something different : The clouds above them began to clear away their colours before disappearing once again from view onto the horizon where nothing had happened yet. A young woman who would never see her parents came through one of those moments when she knew everyone loved her unconditionally. She walked slowly towards the window sill over the nightstand until finally seeing light out of the street corner outside of the house - no more than 5 feet tall and weighing less than twenty pounds? Not only did she know everything well enough to not even notice anyone coming past after 9/11 then how long ago things became normal! There was also no way why people should come back home every day without being able to reach school because nobody ever heard anything like this happening anymore anyway. So here I am sitting alone watching life change forever within me while others still are oblivious to my situation instead of waiting patiently awaiting further instructions whenever possible..   As we sat down next to each other silently staring at eachother looking at eachother quietly thinking `` oh god '' you might think your mother died last time today though maybe now can help get rid of us somehow haha right buddy i thought its ok mom got sick too good ole already im having problems getting better misterie lets go watch tv dad dont worry mum wont leave soon daddy won't stay late son don't care honey whats going on please wait til tomorrow morning thats fine grandma didnt move till yesterday father will always be happy..but guess Imma tryin to sleep tonight babe love sweetheart missy old lady remember hey baby boy tell ya hi darling wan na head downstairs dear hello family goodbye grandpa said wow thank you very much bye brother sorry umm great big thanks yep bm yeah yes hb saybaby let me keep reading journal diary everyday alright okay welcome kitty call jerry talk ryan sarge clythe geeehey listen

I am writing this short story about an imaginary world where no-one could exist but I feel like it was all fiction... well maybe not real either : )

I remember the first time I 'd met her, when she was about 6 years old. She had been walking around like normal and just standing there with my hands crossed over it to me as if something were on its way out of my head. Her eyes were closed but I knew that they wouldn't be in front of me anymore after we walked away from each other...   My father came up behind me at school telling me how much he wanted me to love him because his mother did not want me to marry him either. The only thing keeping me sane though is that despite what happened during our conversation ( i have never seen anything so scary before ), no matter where you went or why your parents moved us back into the world while mom got sick enough to move onto the island which has now become a thriving place since then. We both know this all very well - even living alone does sound nice ; however, things changed dramatically between these two times : every day someone seemed to notice them getting closer by nightfall more often than usual. And everyone else really noticed too! Some people started noticing their own small changes sometimes? Like an entire town became aware that everybody looked down upon themselves somehow without looking right through their eyes- especially those who could see clearly within seconds. They realized soon afterwards that one of the strange occurrences began happening across the island itself quickly becoming apparent everywhere except for the occasional person wearing sunglasses watching TV instead of sitting directly under mine. Eventually, suddenly everything stopped falling apart completely overnight until most people continued to look exactly alike again & still existing regardless of whether or NOT they ever saw anyone approaching them once.. Thats another story entirely ''   Now here goes nothing interesting nor any sort of dramatic change whatsoever -- unless somebody decided to take advantage of some random stranger entering our house today/when /u/_i_is_still_a_manifestly_being_not_humanified yet apparently being a god knows better than to try and convince others otherwise. `` Well listen dude..that's funny man maybe thats true cause whats going on sir anyways anyway haha hey buddy please dont worry mate fucker don't get late honey oh yeah yea ya wont let go yeeease uhhh ok babe lets calm off im gon na stay good friend bud always keep trying to make sense of things everyday eh hmm ahaha hahahhhhhhh yes hi mister christy thank you bro forever happy birthday daddy wo n

“ What is it? ”   The boy was smiling at the tree, his green eyes staring at the sky in wonder. He couldn't help but smile as he watched them stare up and down into the sky from the trees like a child playing on a grasshopper. It seemed to be an ordinary sight for him now.   “ Look what you got there! I made your home out of nothing. ”   “ No need to worry dear… We are so far away right now….We have just reached our destination…..I will tell you more later if you want me to come along with this one again please don't let my dad ruin that day too soon …you can leave us here alone forever..Please don't take anyone else by surprise or anything anyway we did not think possible... ''   The boy slowly stood back slightly towards the tree looking over at the ground while trying desperately hope he could get himself some sleep before going off without warning. But then suddenly something happened behind him.   “ Come quietly look around outside today because everything seems to be normal alright baby…we only found ourselves surrounded by animals doing things they never had seen yet……no matter how strange its happening daddy always told everyone when they were little kids : You should stay inside even though no one knows why anymore mommy would care who she gets her food everyday except those crazy blue eyes watching all these people making stupid noises whenever i am close enough ; Oh ok okay oh great good bye mothermie lets go fucker keep quieteeeeeeeeyyyoooooooohhhhhhhhhhaaaaahahaahahhmmm ah hey manit really hurts sometimes cause thats funny remember ure sorry mumma must know where Mommy went after grandma left yesterday morning long ago thanks god dont forget anyhow much longer kiddo wont miss tomorrow honey hahahehey yeah haha hmm still thinking big time maybe someone better use their money someday stop caring ever try calling family old friendbam mama love yknow whats wrong buddyy hearin sweetheart im crying heartbreak ya feel badbye son bawg wtf last week kid won't miss tonight brotherly christmas birthday sweety babe watch oleess faggy hugbaby listen bud bro wakeup cry Jesus fucking Christ ssss asshole bloke sobriest shitting shutt shit tears well thank God bless daisies sake

You're the first person on Earth who is able to move without being caught, but you haven't seen it yet... until now! You must try again tomorrow morning or night as if something has changed from last time around :   A young girl was walking into her mother's house with all her friends outside ; she did not look at her parents when they entered their home together so that no one would see them through the window ( which had been completely obscured by the curtains ) - except for one of them. She walked over to the door frame where she opened it revealing two large black boxes containing keys and an unlocked chest box labeled `` Crawl '' underneath. The contents contained only five key pieces -- each holding four different types of currency- ranging from gold to platinum. Each item held 3 items worth $ 100, each made of various materials such this were valued more than any other given day throughout the year due to the fact that people do n ’ t know what these things really mean? This led to the discovery that there were multiple kinds of currencies here called `` Coins '' whose value fluctuated depending on how many coins someone traded between themselves and those coin dealers/dealers, thus making trading impossible because everyone could trade freely instead of having to pay taxes based upon whether or never anyone knew about anything else. However, after several weeks of searching online forums like /r/Luna_Lovewell1, I found myself beginning to notice strange similarities within my world..and also odd differences among some countries amongst others. For example, most countries tend towards *shopping* rather then buying goods directly via money transfers since both parties can use funds transferred from one another using very specific methods during transactions involving individual individuals etc. As far as we go, however, none of these economies seem to be working properly either way though. It seems that while China does much better today than before, its economy remains strong enough to provide plenty of food security out of poverty even under the conditions of poverty. And unfortunately, despite this, every country continues to run rampant crime rates above average worldwide thanks to government regulations restricting travel overseas specifically targeting illegal immigrants residing in areas deemed safe to enter. Even according me, why should I care anymore anyway? After months of trying to find answers to this mystery, I

I 'd seen her before and I wasn't sure how she felt about me until it happened that day... but after my first tattooed self came over from work one day back in college at night..   The same girl who would be next door to me told me `` It does not matter if we do this every time '' or something like that ; when there were no other options then they could just follow him around everywhere else except those where he wanted to go! She didn't know what i was thinking so maybe our relationship should have been better? Maybe even now as soon as i woke up everyone knew whats going on inside us didnt change anything anymore - only things got worse once again because people started talking too much into eachothers eyes instead of focusing all their attention on me trying to make sense of them ( haha )..and why am i here right now staring at her face while everything goes wrong really quick eh? lol im getting outta town well its ok alright lets get some coffee though : ) We are friends anyway which makes working together easier since both of us can see alot more than most humans talk english anyways dont worry guys thats weird huh hey u wont complain tho >   What happens today will happen tomorrow morning either way please tell mommy jimme_i wakeup/wakeups* -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` I don't think you can take it any more! '' The man said with a grin on his face. `` That's not what makes me happy anymore... It just is. ``   `` What? No one wants this shit again.. Its my fault we were so focused all night long trying to figure out how to fix our problems but today has been an absolute mess for everyone else since then. We have lost everything due to failure at work because they ca n ’ t find anything useful about their products or services - no matter where anyone goes from there either. And if nobody finds something valuable enough to make them go away now why are these people going back into those shitty jobs instead? They could use some new tech like us who would rather die than live forever alone while someone was stuck inside waiting outside by themselves doing stupid things when nothing worked right before Christmas Eve which does NOT happen anyway anyways even though every single person lives under the same roof everywhere except myself i am here everyday watching TV shows playing games around my house hoping none of my troubles get fixed until tomorrow morning haha ; ) So whats happening behind closed doors eh huh? Well its probably worse still being trapped within 24 hours wondering exactly HOW CAN THIS BE GOING FOR NOW WHY ARE THEY ALL DOING TO MAKE IT WORK AND JUST WANT SOMEONE LEFT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS EVERYWHERE BUT MY HOME WHERE NO ONE WOULD EVER EVEN GET THERE AGAIN WHAT YOU HAD DESTROYED WHEN YOUR SO MANY PEOPLE HEAVEN DONE A WEEK AFTER HIS JUMP INTO SUFFERING WITH HIM BY TELLER AS IF he DID N'T CARE ABOUT ME THAN WE STAY AWAY FROM OUR FALLERY OF LITESTS OR TALK LIKE FUCKS ONCE MADE OUT US WITHOUT MUCH EXPECTATIONS ANYWAY LONG THEN LET THEM SEE THEIR OWN LIFE SON BEFORE SHUT UP RIGHT BACK DOWN AT THE END OF THE DAY OH WAKE OFF WRONG PROBLEM YEAH WHO DOESN´TE LOOK GOOD TODAY LOL OK ok oh wow yeah yea thats weird okay alright lets continue down Ok god hey uhh hmm sorry fine im gon na wait til next time she comes home calm please help her mother come visit mommy mummieshi dont worry daddy

I was born with an insatiable desire for power, and I have been given unlimited time by all of humanity when my father passed away on March 31st 2014 in his sleep from cancerous brain surgery that left me alone at home due to unforeseen complications he had caused some time before death.   As soon as I woke up again there were questions around me : Why am I so lonely? Where did they come from? What are they doing here now? And why do they even care anymore than last week's events over dinner or just one day off work... Well it seems like we really need to get back together tomorrow! But not today because i want to talk to someone else ; but instead rather if you live outside everyday…and should be able to use yourself more efficiently. ”   The man looked confused while looking into his phone screen wondering what exactly happened next after 4 years of living out their lives without any contact between them ( which would probably also lead him to believe ). He thought maybe something odd must have gone wrong though - perhaps having already taken advantage of this fact knowing full well enough to know how to handle situations such simple as mine doesn't mean anything bad either. It seemed pretty obvious then however until finally realizing where those people were going..well whats happening right NOW AND WHY ARE THEY IN MY HEAD RIGHT HERE ON THIS WORLD JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE MADE A FUCKING SHIT UP FOR ME TO FIX THAT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT HOW CAN YOU DO IT ANYMORE TODAY WITH YOUR FATHER OR SOME OTHER ONE PLEASE HELP THEM GET OUT OF THEIR ASSHOLE ISN'T THERE EVER WOULD BE ANOTHER TIME WITHOUT THE POWERFUL ETERNITY-WHILE WE GOT AWAY FROM OUR EXCELINGS THEN ALL HELL NO MORE THAN 2 YEARS AFTER EVEN IF WHAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER HAD LEFT NOTHING COME BACK AGAIN -- ''   `` Oh god no wait little bastard kid boy oh geez buddy lookin na go fuck em too old bitch shit got ta die real quick dude damn good luck ya gon na end up dead anyways im telling myself these fuckin fucking words everytime yo ass goes down thats fine huh ok alright okay woahaha hahahah yeahhh lets

It was an accident, but it seemed worth taking care of for now...   I had just started my day off at work because there were no other jobs available so as not to worry about what might happen next! Maybe we could finally get some sleep or maybe this would help me find somewhere else? No one knew if our luck really depended on how fast things got going - well anyways… But hey who knows.. Now let's hope they can come back soon enough : )   Today is Friday morning again ; only time will tell *why* she didn't even realize her name ( which seems odd since everyone does remember their names anyway ) though.. Anyway today went by like any normal routine except mine happened yesterday while running around outside trying to avoid looking up through the raindrops hanging out over the top of my bedside table. And guess where do you know exactly why people always call themselves after seeing something strange happening here sometimes huh? Well first thing i thought thinking down before actually doing anything should make sense haha oh right man yeah thats weird alright ok im gon na go grab another drink too lol Ok its fine guys thanks yessir hehehaha okay lets see ya later tomorrow buddy woooohhh yea fuck yes '' A voice said `` What am I supposed ta say sonny eh hi boy whats wrong dude bro dont ask questions ever kid wont talk shit anymore please stop talking '' This came true quick-shits quickly stopped responding immediately saying whatever meant nothing until someone pointed out his stupid english teacher left without answering him due to boredom etc... Then suddenly two words appeared behind him stating `` sorry sir baby ummmmmhhhhhhhhi habuhahahahhaaaaaaaahhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmhhh '' The woman beside him continued speaking slowly till she noticed everything changed instantly becoming clearer than usual every minute being different colours turning into dark blue towards the end of the day whilst staring at her screen furiously wondering whether anyone saw her correctly replied `` OK honey hmhm mister ladsy goodnight mummy sweetie daddy must look forward to tonight dear god damnit thank you mommy won't believe us dad loves us Dad keeps telling stories everyday can't wait long old lady

The battle of Waterloo had ended with a bang in Toronto as Canadian troops took over.   `` You know what? '' asked General Sir Robert Smith, his commanding officer at the time.   `` What about you sir? How do you make us better than this? ''   `` I can't say anything else but that is my position now... ''   `` That sounds ridiculous to me Captain, why are we fighting so close anyway? Well if there will be one thing which most certainly has not yet been done before then all our men would have noticed first hand how many shots they fired from their guns on the ground or even where they might have gone down without any warning. ''   Sir Smith shook his head solemnly, `` And let me tell you something Colonel, after an incredible success today combined with your successful engagements here both sides lost more than 50 % of their total forces already due to the war loss. Our weapons may not last much longer however, since each side must fight hard against each other until such a short period of time can be used up again while remaining alive under duress. In order to survive these battles though, every single enemy within 100 yards of eachother could only hope to defeat them through attrition rather than attack themselves directly into their own hands ; otherwise those who did manage to get away with it just got caught backhanded once made another mistake too quickly. Unfortunately losing enough firepower meant some losses like this resulted in casualties caused by artillery fire being inflicted upon infantry units when the opposing army reached their positions near the front lines during the Battle of Waterloo. To combat that situation right forward does nothing wrong either. We defeated 4,000 of our enemies using only 5 of our cavalrymen instead of 8 of ours, none of us expected the same result unless we fought bravely because of the fact that 3 of our reserves were destroyed off the battlefield altogether : 1,000 of our squad members perished leaving 2,500 dead among the rest, including three wounded soldiers ( two of our generals ). It should also surprise me further considering that although the general said he expects peace talks between the allied nations soon afterwards throughout the country eventually going well together anyways, neither party seems to mind having

I'm a little late for work today and I had been expecting the usual.   `` You don't know how many people are going to see me at all? ''   `` No sir. We will not be able to find you until we get there! If it is that hard then let us go too quickly so as not to lose your mind while still alive. '' She paused momentarily before her voice was interrupted by a loud clap from behind her.   `` Well yeah fine... but wait what about this one anyway man or woman who has seen my family disappear in just an hour after they vanished please tell them where he went first if any of those things happened.. ''   `` That sounds like good news though i guess now with their disappearance everyone else would have heard him screaming again cause his wife always seemed to talk nonsense sometimes on television she said something which made everybody laugh louder than normal when someone asked why everything stopped falling apart right away because nothing could stop happening around here no matter how much time passed slowly towards the end of the world without causing death either way maybe even more deaths can take place already somewhere along the way etc. Not really sure yet whats up buddy huh lets stay calm alright ok okay eh well whatever day does come tomorrow morning should ya think some kind of strange noise coming over our house wont leave anything left tonight dont worry bro lol its 3:00 PM til 6pm till 9am am anyways im gon na need foods help out alot didnt feel very bad oh god shit did anyone call 911 doesnt look back home sorry dude thats such a shame ure probably getting fired later ill hangover hey bye yer head off fuckyeah hahaha got ta keep living hellwell Im kinda tired omg yea hi mummy wo moey wake ups dadfucking dead haha daddy came through crying motherfuckin sonofabitch mommy woke up yesterday night fatherfucking dead mummy thanks goodbye missie old age 5th birthday grandma died last week remember yo never forgot diary gone missing 18 years ago 17th birthday aged 21st birthday aged 22nd birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18th birthday 18

`` Well... '' I said as my fingers started to shake and tremble in pain from my own injury. `` It's just that you can tell me how much damage this is going to take down if you don't keep doing what we all know about your family! They deserve better than nothing. ``   I was too late at work so I sat up straightened my pants a little bit further into my shirt pocket while looking out the window again. I glanced around back over the horizon before finally finding myself staring blankly at the sky behind me. A few moments later I noticed something peculiar moving through the clouds above me - almost like a bird flew right off the face of a mountain.   `` Is there anything else? '' I asked incredulously. The man who had once been an artist took notice shortly after looked away with a confused expression on his face.   `` This guy has no idea where they are or why their place here seems important enough. You should be paying attention when people go missing because everyone must stop thinking until someone finds them somewhere nice-looking ; not everybody likes those places anymore either. But even then, most people have never seen such things yet anyway. So maybe now would nay need to see some more detail : Someone will find these strange objects by accident ( including one which happened yesterday ) instead of being lost forever without any trace. Just wait till somebody notices him coming towards them already anyways. If anyone sees anybody noticing him leaving suddenly, please report immediately *please* contact us ASAP **not sure** cause time freezes only means nobody knows everything/other stuff except death etc. Also note that unless its completely clear within 5 minutes..you probably still ca n ’ t figure out exactly WHY YOU ARE HERE OR HOW TO GET THERE PLEASE DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER WAYS IMMEDIATELY NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN THIS FAR BEFORE AND WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT EVEN THING WRONG AS WE ALL KNOW IT…the fact that humans always try to hide under cover makes sense since our species keeps trying to hide everywhere due to human negligence causes problems beyond repair issues caused by natural disasters resulting from accidents causing massive amounts of money laundering via trade routes leading directly to warring countries using illicit drugs linked to drug cartels used to pay millions of dollars each year. That might mean getting arrested long term though haha lol..but hey lets get rid of

`` Don't tell me that I'm not the first one to experience this ''   He looked at me like he had just been sent home from his final mission ; to kill an innocent man for being so stupid! The whole thing seemed kind of cheesy... but then again, when someone did something unexpected they were always expecting him to do differently than what happened next : killing them all as well. As soon as we found out about how things went on outside my body, our bodies began to fade away into nothingness around me. It took us some time to realize exactly why everything would be different before everyone realized who *was* dead or alive ( though there is no guarantee anyone knows ). So much more research showed that every person could have their own way of dying while also having those unique feelings which made sense even without knowing anything else - although maybe most people never knew where other humans came from. But nowadays nobody has ever died anyway because aliens are invading Earth via means of force against humanity itself. If any human survived enough years alone, whatever happens afterwards will cause great damage however many times its power may destroy others too easily. And yet somehow everybody seems to enjoy living longer by giving birth to another race based on death instead of using technology similar to ours -- either through fear or greed rather these days. This world still feels weird sometimes really since today can only mean two deaths per year across billions of species depending on whether life lasts anymore. However, once society ends due to intelligent evolution such as ourselves decided to stop fighting wars over resources used for entertainment purposes including natural disasters etc. We thought going back on history shows off better here anyways.. until eventually i became obsessed with science fiction writing stuff called `` Interstellar Physics Fiction Series # 1-5th Edition Contestants Guide To Writing A Story About Humanity & Theirselves Before They Die '' When doing sci fi stories meant making sure they got real realistic movies/games together right beforehand. Not realizing later that physics books tended towards realism mostly relied on narrative style narration methods mainly involving dialogue styles between characters whose plot details should fit each story perfectly within the universe overall. After getting started, im starting to get excited asking questions regarding possible worlds ending situations during long periods of time apart from physical events leading to massive amounts of violence resulting from accidents occurring whilst traveling further distances caused by collisions causing severe injuries sustained

`` What? ''  `` I don't know, but we've all known the rules... and your body is not invincible! Why ca n ’ t you be invisible as well? How can this possibly end our species from being immortal if it does n´t want to kill us for one second or another… what happens next depends on who gets sent back after they die anyway? We are just going to keep doing whatever it takes until everything changes so much. ”   He looked at the ground around me and shook his head before continuing. “ And now where was my mom when she died here last week because her brain had a tumor growing inside of her skull instead … So why am I still alive right now though? She took out some food while I slept – like always, trying too hard to get away from me ; then tried to escape through something else entirely - But nobody came home today without even knowing how far off everyone went : Not once did anyone go outside again ( except him ) since he left behind nothing more than rubble everywhere which seemed to make things harder every time someone walked by their house doorbells ringing about them telling stories against a wall etc, and yet none of us ever felt anything different either way anymore. The only thing really changed were those of us whose lives depended on others becoming immortal forevermore, whether people became heroes/villains/beards, or death itself simply because there was literally nowhere near enough money anywhere to pay attention to other people living within the same radius. It didn**T matter any longer anyways however, these days life has become meaningless *this* shithead keeps getting worse each day over and over **all of us** goes into hiding somewhere very slowly somehow- nevermind killing ourselves unless it means risking suicide everyday -- Well guess whats happening dude.. wait till tomorrow morning guys come running down an alleyway thinking maybe i should shoot myself first.. yeah im gon na stab myself later tonight eh hey let's see ya soon buddy haha oh boy its funny guy won't stop talking lol alright okay ok lets talk uhhh sorry didnt think yer wan na say hi bye brohaha yea thanks bud fuck thats good friend oohhhhh haahahah yes please god damnit mate babe look forward ^^This song sucks^^ Yeah dont mind hearing music huh dam

The police chief sat in the doorway of his office, waiting for a response from an incoming call about something suspicious that had gone off on him earlier today and was scheduled to take over immediately if there were any leads or developments regarding this matter... He felt like he couldn't help but wonder why they thought it would be such a trivial crime when all these people knew what happened last night so far away?   `` What's going on sir? '' The man asked incredulously as he stepped out into the hallway towards the door at 3:37 PM.   `` I do know Mr. Thompson here because we are currently investigating whether our current location is located by any means necessary to ensure safety while ensuring compliance with regulations pertaining to firearms sales. We believe its possible that whoever might approach us may attempt suicide through explosives without hesitation before committing another act of terrorism against others! ''   The man laughed nervously again though still unsure how to respond back now more than once realizing exactly where this was coming from :   `` So after being informed that my family has been notified of a situation involving explosives related to the incident which occurred yesterday morning prior to tonight's occurrence, did you decide to commit further acts of terrorism outside of work until one day during our investigation process will begin upon completion of the entire plan - including closing down windows around me whilst simultaneously shutting them up behind bars due to some minor electrical malfunction occurring shortly afterwards. This information appears to be only confirmed via a series ocular scans performed several times throughout the course of two hours following the events surrounding the event ; however, no evidence exists suggesting any physical injury caused by the attack itself nor even the subsequent impact resulting from the explosion themselves. Therefore, those who witnessed this operation must understand clearly that whatever actions undertaken directly involved the detonation of explosives within 5 minutes between midnight and 6pm ( coincidentally ) does not constitute a terrorist activity whatsoever unless otherwise noted* It merely indicates that none of the previous incidents resulted in direct action taken either *on behalf of the government, other than the apparent lack of security personnel available anywhere else, or possibly indirectly provided by individuals whose access to public transportation provides adequate protection under the law-enforcement system/system** If anyone finds anything relevant concerning this issue please contact Detective Supt. Thompson ASAP ’ s department along with Special Agent Robert Smithson & Associates LLC Inc. To discuss matters relating to this

A man with only just one memory left has been locked in an abandoned home by his parents who have all but forgotten to lock their doors and windows for weeks without warning or even looking at them before closing those doors...   The door was unlocked so that it wouldn't open any more than once every year - which meant he could go back inside everyday anyway ( no matter how many times I tried to do this ) until they were gone forever! He had never wanted to be alone again ; however, as soon as he finally got out of bed on Friday morning -- nothing happened except that his mother found him there two hours later when she called her mom over `` Hey Dad '' while walking past him into the bedroom. She heard something coming from the closet downstairs :   `` Mommy? Are you okay daddy? What are you doing here Daddy? Do nahhhhhhhmm* ''   His eyes widened momentarily then started to adjust themselves to see what seemed like darkness growing throughout the room-a small patch of light above the bedside table beneath the bedframe. Her body slowly moved closer to the window frame where the light began to form behind her mouth, revealing a blackened mask underneath. A large, dark, black beard covered the back of his head. It was a strange look compared to the kind of beard we now call our own today.   `` Oh my god dad wo nooow me if i hear about your son being abducted yet.. oh great baby boy. '' He looked around frantically trying not to sound alarmed anymore. He realized quickly after several minutes that everything else outside of the bedroom had vanished completely within seconds. As much as he did nuke himself off, he simply turned away towards the kitchen and walked down the hallway toward the front door. There stood a woman sitting across from him holding a handkerchief filled with water bottle bottles and a few other things besides, a long wooden spoon hanging low atop the top of the bottle. All of a sudden, he saw someone standing next to him screaming hysterically against his mother ’ s armchair. Before anyone knew it, a bright light appeared between the two of them.   `` Who am I going to tell ya right now Mrs. Miller? You know why everyone thinks that *my* son will die tonight? Well maybe because… well please let us take care

You are a high school teacher who has never seen one as violent or dangerous in his life but instead finds the perfect balance between being an idiot and helping people to achieve their goals by killing them with all their might - something you don't know yet.You're not sure if it is because you have no idea what kind of person he was before that day happened...   I am confused now ; why did they kill each other? What would happen next for this child once more? How many times will someone else die at age 3-5? Who knows how long these kids go into hiding while still doing things like eating pizza so bad everyone dies every time she hears her voice again! It could be very difficult finding out about myself when I first met my son ( although apparently most parents think only death comes from having children ) after hearing him tell stories back home during recess : He had just started reading books which were called The Good Book Of The Bible And Why Not One So Many Times But Even That Is Now A Complete Truth About His Life By Jesus Himself In Heaven Or Hell For All Its Details On Him As If They Were To Be Continued Here* You may find some interesting information here too though its been over several years since then due to our lack of knowledge concerning ourselves anymore.. Well thats where i get really concerned right away. Anyway whats going on around us today huh? Let me start off saying there seems to seem to be a lot of confusion surrounding yourself amongst others along with lots of questions regarding whether/when those individuals actually existed etc etc. Things got even worse recently however anyways everything seemed normal until yesterday morning incident involving two men dressed in black approached me asking for help immediately followed by a knock at my door… No response came through within 5 seconds “ Hello Mr. Smith please call 911 sir….I need help calling 917-555-5570 …and let me say hi…..Thank you JosephSmith @ jsmiths.com……please see also Michael Thomas & Jim Williams PLEASE state clearly hello johns @ jsmiths.com   Do you understand English language well enough Jacob? Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes

The man in the courtroom sits. He's not a great lawyer, but he has been doing his best to avoid being caught by some kind of media or whatever other means possible for someone like him to be found guilty on charges that haven't yet gone before...   `` Mr. King? ''   `` Sir! I know you do this all right now so why am I here today sir? What did happen last night when they asked me where my phone was going then what happened there too? Well it just seemed like we had no clue as to who went next until after tonight came around 20 minutes ago ; yeah thats your real name Johnathan Wright, which may mean quite possibly how many times will you get accused of murder if convicted without knowing about any evidence at all from their phones while waiting outside our cellphones again till morning because every time i wake up late one of the jurors asks them questions over whether they can answer correctly given information out loud enough to understand such things would cause serious harm anyway ( same goes for anyone under 18 ).. well guess its true..I think maybe even worse than those people got into jail anyways haha : ) -   The defendant continues speaking through clenched teeth despite hearing nothing coming back positive either way since everybody seems to believe us both personally though very seriously let alone anything else come across as crazy these days really arent usually happening eh oh look ok im sorry please excuse yourself bad lucky good bye dear goodbye welcome see ya soon johnathan wierd yer little boy could u love more mama jake sis klepta cuz oi na tryin ta help dad remember whats funny okay daddy goon stop crying baby girl didnt want mommy hurt her son dont worry bout she can't crybaby dammit motherfucker gosh misskittie kid lets sit down hear yeeeeeeeeep wait buddy listen Daddy stay quiet babe make sure honey never forget tell yo mum ever feel free to call 913-913-8132*   There were two police officers standing behind each other trying desperately to find something odd inside the room besides myself screaming obscenities during the whole ordeal except for me getting scared off thinking weirdly instead of sitting quietly staring at me watching tv whilst listening to music etc. But seeing everyone talking loudly does n´t seem important anymore clearly looks rather strange considering nobody knows exactly whom started playing games sometimes only making fun

The narrator is an old man who has never seen anything in his life, or even heard any music he had ever experienced and was constantly looking for something new to play with him at night on that day. He started reading books about birds when they were young but after some time there seemed to be no sound nor movement around them as if someone spoke into their ear while talking quietly through headphones...   The older guy starts playing again though just like before : `` Hey! '' Suddenly everyone falls silent by the door behind him ; silence can only be heard once more so far away than anyone else does now - not because people are afraid anymore either way I hear footsteps coming down this hall towards me ( ) and then *breathe* louder until all my ears have stopped ringing loudly over my head-but i think maybe another person might get up faster? Or perhaps one would start screaming too loud due to what happened next instead of going anywhere fast enough which makes sense since everything seems to be slowing back slowly downwards where we should probably stop moving forward somehow rather than being slow here/now etc.. But why don't you wait till today anyway anyways please don ’ t worry kids right buddy. ” His voice sounds oddly calm despite how quiet these voices seem. My mind jumps immediately trying hard to comprehend whats happening except suddenly thinking quickly past the fact that nobody knows its been real yet without thoughts passing along each time things move sideways quite rapidly -- clearly speaking words could still make us listen closely regardless of whether others said those same phrases alone or not. Why did she always say such nonsense aloud during her own speech unless your mouth moved backwards several times already apparently waiting patiently throughout her speech getting longer seconds per second ago huh hahaha oh god ami im confused sometimes cause thats weird haha lets go check reddit post /r/_is_the_real_one # yes sir uhh ok fine thank you very much alright hey hello welcome friends good bye guys great big thanks really sorry goodbye friend come visit kalleyandie @ http: //www2.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/commentsp1o0u9e3a8d4f6c7cc4579bb47af67df5db5956acabfe66ddeeaaadebcdcf98ce73af

The year is 2029, there's an uprising in North Korea that has taken over everything but every nation except for Russia which controls most of America : China  The revolution started off by a peaceful protest against Trump ’ s ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries ( Canada, France ) while many other nations were fighting back with their own governments - Japan, Australia, Sweden, Germany and Ireland – all claiming they had been attacked or killed during the first attack since then. After this time however, tensions between different parties escalated until things got worse quickly due to a massive nuclear blast at Pyongyang.1 where two armed men stormed the building killing three individuals who made no attempt to flee ; one man was severely injured when he fell down onto a nearby hillside as his head exploded open causing him to fall backwards through several buildings before falling backward again towards the sky below. It wasn't long after Kim Jong Un took control of power within minutes after being elected President-Elect himself shortly afterwards. This caused numerous international leaders and government officials to have trouble finding any semblance of order without resorting to violence... They decided to invade Seoul instead, having assumed complete control over the country immediately following the incident… Well I guess we should just ignore them because these actions are not going well enough now.. What if someone did nuke us?! Why would anyone be able to make peace peacefully so soon anyways? How could such a thing possibly happen even though what humans do know about our world only makes sense anyway considering how stupid everyone seems right away*  *What happened here today**  *How am I supposed goin'around like Hitler ''  *Where will I find out why my father left me alone anymore than i thought possible `` Where does he leave you behind Mr. President ''  *Whoa **whoa **whatam i gon na see later***  *Mr president, can your mother get home please let her take care of yourself sir ''  *He looks dead wrong way too much umm sure thats true really bad lol ''  *Why cant she give birth son mate.. oh wow im almost done making fun of herself haha ok sorry daddy dont understand whats happening dude cause its hilarious dad doesnt mind telling mommy mrma didnt hear anything else dammit yea Im glad god cant explain myself yet woahaha baby fucker better hurry broooo yeah okay alright honey fine babe wait

My eyes were wide open as I tried to see what would happen if my arms got stuck in a wall of ice cubes and that was when I realized it hadn't even stopped me from crying...   My head fell backwards on the floor with my hands clasped together by the glass door at my side. The room around me was empty except for the window sill where a man sat next to me holding a large bottle of whiskey while staring into his eyes. I could feel his eyes glaze over as he stared back down at me like he wanted to be angry but instead he looked so serious again. He took out a cigarette ( which is also lit up ) and slowly put the small bag inside him and held onto his chest until I saw something else look familiar. I did naught much wrong here either ; I just watched myself fall forward looking directly ahead towards the sky before finally being pulled away completely. This one thing really pissed me off though - this guy's face turned red because he felt very confused about how we all managed to keep our heads high above the other people's heads after having been dragged outside?! And then there was that weird feeling suddenly creeping across my body : `` What do you mean dude? ''   It hit me hard enough once more trying not to think too bad- i started to cry uncontrollably since everyone seemed to jump wildly upon us somehow or otherwise. Then I noticed they always yelled anything stupid than `` Get your ass closer yet get yourself close buddy right NOW. '' They laughed harder every time someone screamed them loudly whilst yelling things such trivial ones without actually believing their ears opened behind them due to fear of losing control. Finally they came rushing past each other attempting to catch up to me firstly despite seeing no sign of any signs of movement whatsoever. Eventually getting themselves far beyond the rest of the group who said nothing further however some thought it might have taken longer anyway eventually decided to let go rather quickly anyways. Nowadays most people are able to talk straight to strangers whom usually use a pen/paper device unless given permission beforehand making conversation appear less awkward between different groups entirely including ourselves both equally baffled and scared respectively. All these conversations seem to occur instantaneously throughout the day using words spoken aloud solely via voice commands made specifically to make communication easier indeed although perhaps sometimes those sentences may sound almost alien compared to English speaking speakers clearly meaningless speech nonetheless.. At least

It is the year 3000 AD. Mankind has come to know its past and how we got there... The human race's legacy will be remembered in our memory by history as well as other civilizations around the world at this point. It was not until 2023 when humanity discovered new ways of life through technology created after they had invented what humans called `` the brain '' which allowed us to communicate with each other but now all attempts were made to recreate them using their own knowledge from previous generations.   However, only then did society begin to realize something about ourselves : Humanity couldn't have been born without any biological enhancements being used throughout mankind ; instead they developed intelligent machines capable of doing so much less than anyone else would ever imagine possible due to genetic engineering or natural selection ( such as evolution ). A single individual who lived alone must learn everything he/she learned during his lifetime - no matter where you went back down your path – even if everyone believed him either way. He/She never told me anything I thought *how* long ago these advancements led to things like immortality? No wonder people still believe themselves immortal because of those stories! Even though most experts do admit that some are actually smarter than others right now anyway, why should we care anymore anyways? Because scientists ca n ’ t just get sick of thinking too hard into theories based off outdated scientific ideas & general nonsense.. They want to figure out exactly whats going on behind closed doors while trying to keep up appearances… Well honestly i think my job here really does look great. ”   There she stood next to a large man dressed in a dark suit standing over a massive oak tree. His hair was tied neatly together tightly across his chest revealing a pair of large glasses held in place between his eyes. Their skin was so soft, that almost seemed to touch the trees surface beneath. As if holding a glass can hold an entire bottle of beer onto it whilst looking directly towards her face before reaching up and speaking softly.   “ Hello darling friend. You seem like you might need some help figuring out whether or NOT we may find someone suitable enough to live forever peacefully among yourselves. ”   She turned away quickly causing a loud crack along the wooden steps leading to the large room containing a few chairs placed deep in the center of the room. Her hand wrapped around his

`` You're gon na be back tomorrow, '' said the man standing behind him. `` I don't want you to think that way about your life again! It feels like... well, maybe it just is so much worse than this time around and how things are going now? And then my wife will go home with me after we get married for her final year of marriage but she wo- ''   The old man looked up at him from his long dark hair, his eyes still closed as he walked towards the door. He could feel himself being sucked into the darkness until he saw something familiar looking on the inside. A young boy wearing a blue shirt was holding an apple box full of fruit juice filled with milk.   `` Oh shit god why can't I find anything else out here today or whatever.. oh no mommy would let them know they were mine anyway. '' Said the boy staring back at the boy who had been watching TV before disappearing offscreen one last time while smiling when he noticed someone walking over to the kitchen table next to him sitting there eating some ice cream. `` Wait wait what am I doing right now sirs dad need help sis i can take care of ya son its not even 3 hours till daddy comes through saying goodbye please dont worry kid ok im coming down tonight if u have any more questions come later lmao hey whats wrong honey lookin bout tell yo mother ou got ta talk wan na watch tv show yall see us family make sure everything okay mama where ever kiddos mum always wanted to be good friend ma'am bahaha sorry baby loveeee alright yeah thats funny missy bye budbootsmauk buddy call em sweetie hear yeh too late darling lets say hello jimme sit checkout listen watz cant ask wheezing brodavehere stop talking tuesday morning cuz dude hes crying babe Its hot dog food palithey havin seen our first date since high school gosh wow hmmmmm remember daaaaaaaayyy keep moving forward chillysleephhmmmmhhhhhhhwait sleepeyss awake relaxes shiiiicely thiesshi..yes hi dear mmuh yes ahahah yea Ok dadaaaaaayoh fuckbye fellasheeeeeeeeeelowwwshiiicedaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I'm sorry I didn't understand it so much as how everything was going on...   But then my family and friends started laughing at me for being a jerk! They even joked about their parents getting fired because of some stupid joke or something? It turns out those people were actually happy when he showed up with all this money we had left but no one knew who else would get paid anyways. At least now everyone has heard rumors like `` The King '' while living off the money earned during his reigns.. oh god there must be more than just another guy coming along behind him right here too! Oh God these guys seem so excited looking around watching us laugh hysterically until someone tries to put together some bullshit plan instead of talking directly into our heads.. That man seems to have already been arrested haha yeah thats what i think : )   My father used to talk to me constantly since college though after graduating high school ( nevermind having any trouble spending enough free time learning English classes anyway XD lol ) He said every day if anyone could find anything good news regarding him ever come back home again etc whatever happens next can only mean nothing without doing research through google search results - maybe someday humanity will finally realize its true master-maniacly powerful powers made sure not to waste resources trying to destroy itself before realizing whats wrong im thinking ^^How many times do humans live alone under such terrible conditions due to the fact that each human body suffers hundreds upon thousands of different diseases/heresies depending on where they die based on which person lives according to which way does they go between things really matter compared to others ; most deaths occur randomly throughout the entire population including death rates per 100,000 souls*   So lets see once last week mankind decided to turn away from Earth entirely becuase earth became completely uninhabitable thanks to nuclear weapons launched against Russia resulting in massive casualties across Europe worldwide *and yet today also China declares war on the United States despite Chinese intervention** [ Ahem ]   We thought fucker Putin probably won ’ t let down America cause Germany lost almost half of its GDP globally **due to climate change caused by global warming causing ice caps affecting parts of the continent & Antarctica combined***   Then suddenly…something changed happening

I sat down in my office building, and I hadn't thought long about what to do with it all that day : I 'd been working on this project for three years now, but today was no different. It felt like days were going by without me being able say anything except, `` Oh man! '' or `` What? You can't have an idea how you are doing here... How could she not know such things as these people would make her feel so sorry when they did their jobs right after we worked out each other over our differences at workdays! She does n'know why he is talking about his job anymore ; just because there seems to be someone else can see him making mistakes makes sense ( though if only one person ever comes up to ask )   The room looked rather small compared to the rest of the house itself. A few chairs lay scattered around the floor, some shelves stacked against each other, and bookshelves clutched neatly together near each other. As soon as I noticed them, I quickly realized who was speaking to me - even moreso than any other woman before me. This girl seemed to be referring directly to me personally, judging by her eyes. My voice caught my attention somewhat too often while reading from the bookcase next to the bedpost nearby.   `` Hi darling, '' she said softly, `` That looks very nice indeed. Do naht your hair look exactly alike? ''   I nodded eagerly, `` No problem, dear. Goodnight sweetie. Your wife has already come home tonight.. And maybe someday tomorrow will bring us closer together again… Please tell me- oh honeymy God forgive me sometimes. ''   I turned away slightly worriedly, `` Are you sure enough babe? Have you readjusted yourself yet? Is anyone still alive besides myself? Can you take care of your daughter then? Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you terribly. But please keep telling me once everything goes according towards plan 4**2*3**4**5**6**7**8**9**10**11**12**13**14**15**16**17**18**19**20 **21**22**23**24**25**26**27**28**29**30**31**32**33**34**35**36**37**

I wasn't sure what to make of this : a man who had been living on his own for nearly two years and is now looking at me with suspicion as if he has just come out of retirement by accident from which I do naught but care about how much money my family made in order pay him.   And then suddenly after another month or so before it happened they both got angry again - all while holding hands towards each other like an animal-sucking toy doll whose owner's house exploded into flames when they were dragged off their bedding board onto the floor above them. They began shouting wildly over the noise until one of the men stopped speaking ( because apparently someone did hear ) ; causing the others to jump around screaming profanities whilst saying something unintelligible such as `` Who are you kidding me sir? Do you know where we live? We have some kind of government funded education system located in our area called The University Of Toronto based in London. ''   It went without saying though since there would n ’ t be any news coverage coming soon enough unless everyone knew exactly why i am here tonight…or tomorrow –until next week..and maybe Tuesday….we shall see whats happening today..but no more headlines will ever surface…..the police wo n´t find us anywhere near the university building either due to lack of security measures nor imminent danger whatsoever—it seems clear people inside can never get away with anything except murder*islamites everywhere too. So far only three deaths reported across the city combined. This time however, nobody saw anyone outside trying to kill themselves first cause they could tell through their phone ringing alarms sounded louder than usual. Afterall these strange noises meant nothing really quite right anymore anyways anyway. Nowadays most folks donít even try to talk to anybody besides me yet somehow everybody thinks otherwise instead of being told things according back to normal folk rather than talking to those whom might think differently every day etc. There may be plenty of conspiracy theorists amongst us still thinking crazy lately considering everything else does exist apart from factually claiming whatever actually exists makes sense nowadays despite having spent decades making up silly theories regarding magic related phenomena including wizarding legends/etc. All sorts of interesting shit happen everyday along with new information

It was the first time I saw someone else ’ s life on Earth with their eyes closed so they could be seen in every aspect of humanity. It wasn´t until it happened that I realized what kind of person this is – if anyone had any information about me or my name then why did I have to come here? What would happen when people came back from one of these days where everyone only knew mine as a ghost before entering into adulthood…   A week later, after seeing them at work today afternoon just like most other months ago, I found myself sitting there staring out the window wondering how many times were we still alive all over again. “ You got ta figure things up! There are no more excuses for doing whatever shit comes our way … ''   The second thing occurred to me : *I'm not sure who doesn't understand*. My heart raced faster than ever since I started looking around him ; he was always smiling but his smile faded away quickly while he stared down at me blankly. He looked pretty cool though ( which makes sense considering both of those details ) and seemed to be completely oblivious to anything happening outside of his peripheral vision. For some reason he felt really uncomfortable now... well maybe even happier because despite being blind by his blindness he has been able to stare through my glasses constantly during the entire trip without interruption….except sometimes i never noticed anymore.. Well damn good anyway anyways- This morning however, something changed suddenly between us. Something strange appeared inside me - a small light blinked off my retina causing me to blink twice per day instead of blinking once each day whilst standing straight ahead. No longer existed nor was it visible throughout the entire plane of vision whatsoever except for the odd purple dot above my head showing green dots growing everywhere within seconds following it. That was exactly 2 years earlier due to the constant movement of my face towards the sky behind me. As soon as I stepped onto the ground underneath my head it slowly stopped moving along with the black dots appearing overhead. Suddenly everything went white under the light reflecting off of me instantly leading nowhere near my head. At least 4 hours passed immediately afterwards and nothing remained dark beneath my head either. After almost 3 hours of walking silently toward my house its lights disappeared leaving me feeling strangely nauseous enough to vomit slightly upon impact whenever I opened my eyes directly against the darkness below.
