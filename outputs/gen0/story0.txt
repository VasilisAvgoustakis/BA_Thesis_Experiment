We were out in the middle of the night enjoying our favorite dessert together. She was walking up to me and told me about the day before Christmas ; the day where she died from a brain tumor while drinking wine. As I sat there thinking about her death, I thought back to how she had been able to forget things just like that.  You know what happened last year?  I asked her.  That one girl who didn't even notice us coming over every day until 2:30AM-  Her voice trailed off abruptly then stopped completely.  No! Not anymore!  she said,  It ca nÂ´t be happening right now because no one else has heard of this yet.  I looked around confusedly. I noticed several people standing next to me. They seemed so familiar with each other. They were all looking at me with wide, yellow eyes.  I am sorry sir, I must warn you something may happen if you keep telling me otherwise. Your wife will die soon enough though. Please get inside safely by yourself without any trouble whatsoever. Do not leave alone please.  I pleaded with them.  Can you hear me?  I asked them.  No Sir.  Their voices sounded different somehow.  What does that mean?  I asked.  I saw her first hand..  A voice replied.  <newlineSorry guys
