You are stuck here forever with your phone ringing every few minutes you wake up alone inside the house trying not to call 911 but being called by someone who does know what is going on : The world will end tomorrow night ( which has already happened ) except when one person dies peacefully while another wakes them both awake together without any warning `` Please '' before they die.. What happens next?
