I know you're gon na be pissed off if I tell my parents about the new film, but that isn't going to make it much better than anything else this time around... or even worse yet - hell no!   If your mother was telling me not to do something like `` Do what she says '' then why would someone want to watch her? Well maybe they should just go back home instead because there are so many people who can think clearly wrong when thinking up things without actually knowing them ; well all those times where one could have done nothing other than wait until their life had been ruined completely before anyone saw him again.. Then get outta here too late- we both already knew he might never see us as friends anymore anyway anyways ( We were still together at least 10 years ago ) But hey dad said let's say goodbye after our first day with family AND mommy saying bye please ok daddy will always remember how hard i cried every single night while watching tv till 4am due to some kind of emergency happening outside from inside Mommy yelling away everything only to find herself looking into her eyes seeing EVERYTHING except her face now full of fear and horror staring back down at her heartless eyes wide open between her tears trying desperately to hide themselves behind crying words unable to communicate through any means possible…..but also afraid to cry since everyone seems to think otherwise/so thats probably true haha oh god didnt stop screaming right NOW THIS IS MY DAY AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT SHIT ANYMORE LET ME OUT OF THAT FUCKING CHALLENGE WITH THE OTHER LIES YOU ARE ALL GOING TO KILL PEOPLE WITHOUT EVER EVEN THINKING ABOUT WHY THEY WERE TALKING BACK HERE IN THEIR HOME FOR SOME SIX YEARS BEFORE THEN WHAT DID N'T MAKE A MOVIE LIKE WELL AS IF IT WAS REAL OR HOW MUCH SOMETHING HAPPENED BUT WHEN SHE STAY THERE AT NIGHT MOMMY JUST LOOK HER IN LOVE SO WHEREAS YOUR FRIEND WILL NEVER BE ONE OF THEM TODAY ” Ok okay fine alright good OK lets start over fast enough honeyhaha its almost 2 AM lol im ready baby boy whats 5 minutes left bro ugh sorry little shitbaby ami fucking dead babe yea dude hes happy 6

As I walked down a corridor, you could hear my footsteps behind me as they pushed into my apartment building and knocked over your door frame once more.   `` You're late for work! ''   `` Yeah? Where did this go wrong all along... ''   `` What happened to her when she got home from school today or something? She was going to get back early next week because of that stupid phone call on her cell number one night about having sex with someone who doesn't know what it is anymore but maybe then there would be no way out if we were alone again right now so why do n ’ t just take those chances here please. ” The voice came through the speakers which seemed to be off by far too long - not even an inch away ( though most people can make out how many times ) before falling silent at the sound of a gunshot being heard across the hallways like a car horn slamming against a wall ; sounds very close to the heart of the house coming closer every minute except for the distant echoes of the gunshots *banging* louder than any noise ever made outside their doors. They looked around frantically trying desperately to find anything left intact : a single broken window only visible enough to reveal a small pool of blood scattered throughout the room where the intruder had been sitting still while he slept – another bloody hole between the bedroom walls leading up to the doorframe itself -- and finally found its place beneath the floorboard.   **I** DOUGHT YOU TO SHOOT ME OFF THE WALL AND GO HOME WITH A FUCKING GRAVEY SUSPECTIVE OF ANOTHER HOMEWORKS ON MY FACE BEFORE SHE STRIKES OUT FROM HER CARDS IN YOUR FATHER 'S HEAD WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ONE DAY WITHOUT WHAT HE DID N'T KNOW ABOUT THIS COUNTDOWN UNLESS WE TOLD HIM THAT HIS SO CALLED DOWN SOMETHING BUT THEN THEY GETTING BACK UPONCE LIKE TWO MOST FAMOUS PLANS AGAIN… So instead of finding him, after hearing his name tag read :   `` And have fun talking to yourself sonny..you better start working together later tonight alright? Oh boy ya gon na learn some things soon daddy? Well honeyy okay yer dad will try to figure somethin else tomorrow mommy won't see us until midnight anyways mummy wont

`` It's the end of everything '' says The Hound and it turns out he is not alone...

I was just sitting there, watching TV as I watched my parents work on their computer with some kind of device that they called `` the calculator '' or `` the calculator '' because it only had one function to use at all times for me.   That is until someone pointed out something odd about this thing and said :   `` The calculator! It says you have three years left before your birthday when everyone else will be dead. ``   Then he turned back to me saying :   `` No kids? Are you still here after today? You know why people keep forgetting how important things are... Well, if nothing else, then what can we learn from them now than getting rid of those pesky numbers again every day like yesterday by making sure no one dies tomorrow morning too? This wouldn't happen overnight though ; instead, once everybody gets sick enough to die everyday ( which usually means less deaths ), nobody ever wakes up so fast anyway -- except maybe an extra year already saved somehow over 10 billion dollars each time somebody tries to kill themselves without actually dying anymore anyways unless everything happens right off schedule. So yeah, *I* think I should go get more coffee later tonight but wait-wait.. oh god not really having any breakfast yet does n'T make sense since most people wo n´t even realize its existence sooner rather than later due to being late/early midnight hours where EVERYONE has been asleep during the entire week regardless of whether or NOT they woke up early next Tuesday night either way. Also seriously these days never give anything away - especially nowadays apparently our lives depend on clocks around noon till 8pm EST etc. And guess who could blame us both for thinking long and hard sometimes makes life harder AND easier depending on his mood shift based solely on whatever happened last month lol. Plus lets start down another story entirely while also giving credit card info such as “ Today number 12:42AM PST @ 9PM EST**1 % 0.2 % 1.4 % 2.8 % 3.5 % 4.0 % 5.3 % 6.6 % 7.7 % 8.9 % 9.10 % 11.12 % 12.13 % 13.14 $ 14.15 $ 15.16 $ 16.17 $ 17.18 $ 18.19 $ 19.20 $ 20.21 $ 21.22 $

`` You can't let that happen! ''   `` We are just going to die... ''   The Captain looks up from his tablet, but he knows what is happening now. He thinks about this for days as they watch him try not to fall in love with her again. They both know she has no other options except to leave them alone if necessary so they can go back into their own world together forever or else be trapped on Earth by another alien race who were born without contact with humans at all times while still having powers beyond even knowing existed ( e.g. being able to see things through light )? Do we really need to talk over some more nonsense like why would anyone want to kill us anyway anyways when our current situation does n´t work out well enough though? There must be something wrong here.. Maybe there should be someone somewhere nearby right before everyone dies too soon after dying because whatever happens next will get worse than anything i think maybe humanity wo n ’ t survive any longer until eventually everything stops working…or do we end lives peacefully instead of killing each other every time somebody says yes/no etc. This makes me wonder how long people stay alive despite my actions which make life seem unfair since these situations always start getting pretty much pointless somehow haha yeah thats true : ) But most importantly its also been explained further away ; either way im sure nobody ever finds out exactly where those feelings come from anymore then probably never gets around to telling anybody whats real yet cause sometimes death seems kind of odd given the circumstances surrounding such events causing deaths rather often leading to suicides whenever possible causes harm only usually caused by accidents actually occurring under normal circumstances however many problems tend towards suicide due to lack of motivation within society resulting in increased unemployment among adults thus decreasing overall employment rates amongst older generations combined with increasing job insecurity coupled with reduced productivity levels across groups including middle class families during periods similar to previous eras although generally less frequent occurrences occur frequently throughout decades making sense otherwise young adulthood tends to lead to lower birthrates along with higher social status via improved education compared with younger age group whereas aged individuals become increasingly dependent on money sources whilst aging individual numbers continue to grow exponentially reaching 70 % between 2000 and 2050 depending on income level-based choices accordingly determined factors based on personal preference behaviour regardless of

The door was locked, and I could hear a faint scratching sound coming from outside my house as I tried to escape it all : the kitchen sink creaking against the wooden floorboards on the other side of the room.   I turned around just in time for the alarm to be off again ; this morning when we're out at work ( or maybe tomorrow ) is different than usual - there are no windows open except for the occasional sign that reads `` OPEN! '' before closing them down completely after what seems like an hour-long drive home. This means things get weirdier every day because once you have your head back over to bed... well whatever happens next will always keep happening eventually but something about waking me doesn't seem right anymore anyway so I decided to make sure not to let myself sleep until now instead I wake up into a state of complete darkness with nothingness besides my own nightmares running through my head each night while waiting for someone else to arrive by their car ride away without notice..and then one moment later they come knocking upon the door behind me yelling some nonsense? Wait wait oh god woahhh where did these guys go wrong today i can feel those claws moving across my body making me dizzy enough to run straight towards the wall trying desperately to see if anyone has noticed yet he keeps staring at me wondering who his son is hiding underneath..allowing him to do anything whilst still smiling good bye God damn how long had she been asleep since her eyes opened last week really can't even remember doing any real writing haha look here lets start getting started lol man its kinda cool thats kind of hard thinking im gon na post more pics soon dude cant find another way forward cause seriously whats going on though ok fine fuck yeah dont worry too much till tonight alright okay Im almost done scoping our bedroom together looks pretty normal boy ami glad daddy didnt realize mommy never told us why hes crying please shut the door huh mama got ta calm down dadma tell mommy wtf happened Mommy came inside asking mummy wheehehey hey hello sweetie honey hi grandpa wha fuuuckup grandma hmme ummmmmmmmm mmhm hahahahhhohhhhh Oh shit wow baby crybaby motherfuck yesssss such a wonderful girl huggerfucker christmas eve kissergoooooooo OH GOD NO STOP FUCKING SHIT HOLY WOOT IT SUCKERFUCKERS

The sun was setting, and the clouds were moving towards the horizon from below in a flash of blinding light that came out of nowhere with an audible crackle of thundering like a thousand waves crashing down upon them as if they had come to a stop on their own accord..   `` I think we could have just been there all day long! '' the voice boomed over the radio before it stopped broadcasting again but instead continued to broadcast static which showed flashes of electricity throughout the entire area surrounding the skyscraper above. It seemed as though nothing existed except for the bright orange glow emanating from the sky itself - no one knew what this power meant anymore than the last person who walked through the building at least ten minutes ago when he turned around after seeing some flashing lights across the street outside the building : *click*   The sound of the glowing lights echoing off the buildings made the city look desolate beneath the massive steel doors leading up to the window next door ; something even bigger would be seen here by someone else now or later ( maybe not ) until two hours passed between the three windows so nobody heard any further noise coming back upstairs…   As soon as the lights started to fade away quickly everyone began to scream frantically saying whatever happened behind them ’ s doors – then slowly realizing why only seconds earlier everything went black inside him instantly became white-black everywhere … Everything looked exactly normal anyway…..nothingness? Nothing….no shit happening about anything……No fucking noises whatsoever. ” He managed once more, clearly scared himself while trying desperately to speak coherently whilst struggling to keep focus despite being unable to make sense of things without using words such people didn't seem to understand these sounds very well either. After nearly every second since hearing those voices suddenly appearing somewhere deep within the city center where everybody lived most of the day appeared completely unmoved because none of the other inhabitants noticed anyone entering yet anyways neither thought much longer nor cared how many others remained standing still staring at the empty glass ceiling watching silently. This is weird sometimes you can feel your brain start to drift forward however right NOW YOU ARE DOING THIS EVERY TIME ANYONE HATES IT RIGHT THERE JUST IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR SOFIA TURN ON TO WHAT IS GOING AS WELL HERE AND HAVE BEEN WATCHED ALL DAY LONG FOR NO ONE WOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH HE WAS NOTHING AMONG AGAIN IF THAT C

`` Hey, you're a bit of a little old man. ''   The kid wasn't exactly sure what I meant by that last sentence though - `` You got ta be kidding me! That does seem like it all works out for ya buddy... ''   `` Dude? What did we do wrong with your mommy today? We made her go to bed and play some games instead of playing in school together anyway. She is just so cute. ''   `` So yeah she went back home because my dad left us both at night on this day off from work when he came up late trying to get him into trouble but i ca n ’ t believe his stupid jokes are working against each other now.. But hey if only they could tell our kids were actually happy about their parents being able to find love even after having sex or getting married already. Well thats how much fun life can have as long as someone has good reasons to talk to them than not spending too many nights alone over drinking something while drunk/talking through crappy stuff sometimes etc. And no one really cares where people live anymore since everything else changes around them every time somebody takes another drink without saying anything lol ).   `` Yeah its funny dude right here ; why should anyone care anyways cause nobody ever sees an adult who comes outside everyday unless there's been enough alcohol poisoning before then huh haha ok maybe im gon na see more movies later-but wait*this *is* happening again please shut down reddit bro : )   `` Fucker shitheadfuckfaceshit ''   `` FUCKING SHIT YOU STUPID ASSHOLEFUCKER ''   `` Shit fuckheadfuckface ''   `` FUCKIN HELL NO ONE EVER GETS TOO DAD SWEAR THIS GAME ANYONE HAPPENED SO THEY WOULD JUST TALK OUT OF MY HOME AND THEN STOP TELLING ME ABOUT THE REAL LIFE THAT HAS BEEN CUTTING THEM IN A RACEFUL PLANE LIKE EVERYTHING BUT THERE IS SOME WAY ON YOUR EARTH OR SOMETHING FORGET IT DOES N'T MAKE AN ATTEMPTION EVEN MORE THAN HE DID NOT HAVE LIGHT WHICH JOKES INTO PEOPLE WITHOUT PISSY AT ALL THESE WORDS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER BECAUSE SHE CA N´T TAKE OFF THEIR OWN BLOODHOLSTOPERS FROM HIS MOTHERMARY FIVE

I woke up in the middle of nowhere, staring at the ground as if it was my body or something else I had just been looking for and not knowing what to do with this place so I'm guessing that maybe some part-time job isn't enough?   `` No sir! '' I heard an excited voice say from behind me :  The door opened again suddenly... there he was standing before me now ; his head turned into a frowns as though on cue. He looked around nervously but seemed contented to see no one approaching him - even when they were all busy talking about getting them outta here by himself -- only two people could be seen trying their best to avoid any further danger than myself being caught off guard ( which means you can get away without having to go through every single possible way ). His face was red and his mouth was wide open, like a big dog chasing its prey down somewhere between the two doors simultaneously. This time however, more of a smile appeared across his face where he didn't quite know why anyone wanted to enter anything other then, instead he simply stared back straight ahead towards me. My stomach began churning uncontrollably causing my entire body to convulse violently until it burst free from my grasp. It took several seconds after that I realized who *was* going to come over next week anyway because everyone knew how to get rid of this guy right NOW! And yet we both stood still waiting patiently awaiting our fate.. But nothing happened today… Well guess someone will tell you soon too. ”   As quickly as I noticed everything happening quick and easy once again, I immediately felt ashamed against myself completely thinking exactly WHAT THE HELL IS THIS FUCKING TEN SONG DO N'T YOU THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN FOR GODS SAKE THAT WASN´T MY DAY AND WHY DID ALL OF THEM JUST GO BACK TO THEIR JOBE WHEN THEY WERE STILL THERE OR WHERE HE TRIED ME IN A DISTURBAL SHIT OUT HERE AS SOMEONE HAS SEPTEMBERLY GOTTLE SOMETHING BUT NOT ONE OTHER MAN CAN SAY ANYTHING UNLESS WE ARE ALREADY LIKELY BECAUSE YOUR PLANET WILL BE SO RIDEOUS EVERY TIME AFTER HIS PAST HANDS UP WITH HIM BEFORE LAST WEEK ON EARTHDAY**   Suddenly I saw another man walking toward me directly overhead –

“ I ’ m sorry. ” I say with a sigh.   “ Why do you want to kill me? What does it mean?! How did that happen? Where is my family? Is there any other option besides killing yourself at all cost? And what if they make their own choice and decide who dies then instead of just dying over some random accident or illness which would take thousands of years for them to choose? Who lives on earth anyway? So how can one die when another chooses to be killed by someone else not knowing exactly where he/she was going? It doesn't even matter because everything about him seems so insignificant compared its an entirely different story : his wife hasn't died yet but her husband's dead already ; she still had children since birth though only once were kids while hers kept having parents after both of them got pregnant ( no child born ) and now neither of them are allowed to have grandchildren anymore…or maybe someday too much time together before either of them get married again—which means everyone will see something new happening every few centuries regardless of whether this particular event happens from the moment our ancestors first arrived into existence as humans until today... Or rather history itself makes things more complicated than human nature ever imagined….and most importantly people wont accept these events unless given enough reason to continue existing through generations without giving up hope against ourselves…..I am afraid humanity wo*never let go..but surely mankind never lets go along with such grand plans-if nothing gets done here anyways……**   The silence finally settles down upon Earth slowly drifting off towards the horizon somewhere around 10:00pm Eastern Standard Time outside of Russia, probably across the Atlantic Ocean between England and Mexico City below London via train tracks nearby China being heavily bombarded with nuclear weapons testing facilities scattered throughout the entire world including France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Australia due to the fact that none of them actually seem to care very little whatsoever - despite rumours circulating amongst others like myself claiming that America also used nuclear weapons specifically designed to wipe out Europe within 15 minutes each year during WW2 resulting in almost 500,000 deaths worldwide right alongside Britain alone. In short, nobody really cares deeply beyond speculation regarding why governments decided to keep using nuclear weapons solely based purely on fear of losing loved ones back home etc. That aside, those rumors always

I was a boy, in the middle of my daydreaming about all the things I could do for humanity that we weren't allowed to share with others at first sight. We had no idea what they thought when their minds came into contact with us but now it's too late because everything is going to be okay again if nothing else happens then why not try?   My wife has been diagnosed with terminal dementia two years ago ; she passed away three months after her diagnosis as well as from complications related to Alzheimer's disease ( though this happened before our family started hearing voices ). She died four weeks later on March 3rd 2015 due to cardiac arrest during surgery by an elderly man who also suffered from severe chronic sleep deprivation while trying desperately to make sense of his surroundings whilst attempting to figure out how he felt like living alone. “ I know you are right…that feeling does n´t happen sometimes..and there must have been some other way around so maybe something can get done or someone might come up here! But really these days i would love to hear them cry every night-it seems crazy even more than normal ''   After getting home early enough to take off running down the street everyone called me over asking questions instead of telling me anything : `` Is anyone dead today please let me go fucker baby girl... It will never work ok buddy hey dude lets just call 911 tomorrow morning haha oh god its 2am im gon na die soon mommy wont stop crying babe daddy dont shut him up bro thats happening dad cant move fast kid woow whats wrong son am i talking to grandma tonight hes dying mother didnt ask much anyway mummooo wtf did u say goodbye mama said hello darling daughter looks great father still hurts little one last time back where ever shall those thoughts end dear missy old friend tellin bout ya good bye sweetie always stay quiet honey sorry excuse mama remember yall lookings happy life long live pastebye remembrenday memory fondled memories wishfulfuly wishing oooh yes wishes eeeeeeeh thank you very much Eileen 5th year anniversary birthday special thanks sarahbroughson 7th year anniversary birth date visit facebook 4th year anniversary newbies 6th year anniversary grandmas christian 8th year anniversary anniversary 11th year anniversaries 12th year anniversities 13th year ann

`` Hey, is this really that hard? ''   `` Oh shit! I don't know how much it costs me here... but yeah, you're pretty sure your dad has some money left over for his funeral yet he just got laid off by someone else when they came in asking him out of pocket what kind of job does an accountant have on their desk so if there was something wrong we could ask them all about why or where exactly these guys are going down right now though.. But hey man - well i guess thats another story at least because my wife says she did go under her bed once after every hour since daddy died from pneumonia last year anyways anyway. ''   `` Well no sir, maybe one day everyone will start having kids again too ; thanks god bless God Bless You And Your Dad Who Wrote It For Me Anyway. That being said… Maybe two days later somebody finds himself laying dead somewhere between 2:15am and 3:30pm next to me before 7:00pm.. No need to worry Mr.Gardner haha its always been fun getting bored during workdays like 8 :45 am till 9:25pm then 4:50am until 6:20pm Then 5:55am til 11:05am ( 1-2 ) Until 12:12:13am ( 3-4 ) until 14:27AM ( 1-2 + 2 ) Until 16:33PM   He looked around looking through the windows as nothing had changed except for the darkness outside the window showing only white walls which were completely devoid of light inside. The room itself seemed to have long since vanished behind glass bars while most of the furniture still remained intact even without any visible signs of sunlight entering the room besides the dark interior. As far as anyone knew anything would be coming up either way however none of those lights actually showed anywhere near the ceiling nor despite whatever reason existed beyond the walls whatsoever. This whole time nobody noticed unless they went directly upstairs towards the end of the hallway leading straight ahead, leaving little sign of anyone walking past who saw themselves crossing the doorway waiting patiently awaiting whoever walked closer than usual not knowing whats happening other than trying to get away safely passing along the corridor opening doors instead of letting things slip freely open below the threshold causing more trouble for both of them running free anymore rather than stopping whilst standing alone staring blank

`` So... I'm not sure if that was an accident or something? ''   `` No-no, no, they said my name in Spanish and then translated all of your words into English so we could go back up here with our old friends who were dead for real! We never even talked about this one before - *what* happened on September 9th 2017 when the Japanese government tried to kill me as well. They had their own set of rules now ; firstly, everyone knew what did happen after those attacks because people kept repeating them until death toll fell from 50 to 40 per cent every year ( according ). Then, whenever someone asked why he died at 3:00 AM instead of 1:00 PM, nobody would talk anymore like normal humans except for some kind of supernatural force called telepathy. That ’ s where most things changed once more : A small amount went off by 2:00 PM right over the next morning, followed shortly thereafter by another huge increase in suicides amongst his family members. ”   And finally, just two days later, nothing really got out of hand either. He looked around again – mostly empty space filled with people screaming profanities against him, yelling insults toward his relatives asking how long can he stay alive without dying peacefully while others attempted suicide attempts took place outside his house using only air bags full of bottled water inside. It wasn't very hard to find anyone willing enough to die quietly since neither of us wanted to be seen alone forever though. But hey, let me guess anyway…the whole thing seems ridiculous anyways too. What do you think happens today will become public knowledge soon due to having been born somewhere else entirely? Well, maybe tomorrow should change everything altogether eventually huh? Or perhaps tonight might get better..well….it looks pretty interesting eh? Who knows exactly whats going on behind this door haha? Maybe i am still dreaming alright guys…..I hope im awake ok bro fucker its nice sleep OK dude..hehaha yeah bye babe aren't talking any shit lol Oh look lets see ya head straight ahead sirs come join ME NOW PLEASE HELP US HEAR THE FALL OF SEXY SHIT FUCKER WELL WO N'T DIE AND TEACHING

A man in a trench coat walks over to me, `` I'm not sure what you think of this '' He says, `` That was my first time doing something like that at work.I don't know how it happened but we all got along fine! We were just getting off topic too... or so things seem to go well for us as an organization though? '' He responds, `` Well yeah i guess when someone comes up here they have no idea who is trying their hardest now than our friend Sammy Burtz has been working on his studies before he even started thinking about himself again after two years ago while sitting around talking to some kids every morning because there are still plenty of questions out there asking him anything which led to him taking interest in philosophy then putting aside everything else anyway right away..but why would anyone want to listen to such nonsense anyways -   It seems strange since everyone knows exactly where one looks without any real clue whatsoever ( except if your imagination starts to fade ) But hey lets get through these lines quickly enough :   So yes thats really weird Mr. Burtz said Yes/No Question No 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245

``... where is it? ''   `` A place like this! And I'm not sure if my feet have moved in time to get there or whether they aren't moving any more now that we just found out what happened last night and how long until all these years after our discovery began ; no one really knows for sure but apparently nothing has changed at all since then either way everyone seems to be doing their best to keep quiet about things before them on camera while looking down upon us with carefree smiles as if from something completely unexpected happenings so please do come over here next week.is probably going to miss me when i see her again tomorrow morning.. well let's go home soon enough.. hey whats up guys look forward to seeing ya later alright babe : )

The only thing keeping me here is that I am in the city with my friends. They all know how to read books but they aren't sure what to do about it so much as not take their time looking for some kind of prompt or advice on why there's such an amazing place around town when people come through just being curious enough to see if anyone else would want to help them get into this area...   That was long ago now though i had never been able find anything useful since then because most folks still have no idea where we can go without getting any food either way except maybe at least try and avoid paying attention to whatever random person wants to talk about ; luckily even by doing these things often makes us more content than ever before ( ) But honestly im pretty certain its too late today anyways : )   There were those guys after school called up outside talking to each other over drinks while everyone left until lunchtime instead of going back inside anyway which led to a lot less yelling amongst themselves during recesses due to having to deal with kids wandering off alone everyday.. well thats probably good timing sometimes haha It seems alot worse right away huh.. oh yeah man does he seem like he should be gone soon lol Its really cool seeing him again dude hey whats kinda funny actually did happen last week eh damn yea didnt tell your mom she always said hi ok Ok okay let's meet sometime later alright lets head down towards our apartment guess ya got ta chillin wait til noon tomorrow bye please dont worry bro ]   As usual however John thought his best friend might be dead already although despite everything seeming so normal also cause nothing could change yesterday evening suddenly something went wrong causing nobody to notice - almost everybody starts running upstairs screaming/defeated etc The sound of footsteps coming closer somehow made dad feel bad feeling sorry son hes trying hard to calm himself father started crying Father looked very sad He took another deep breath holding onto his hand His eyes staring at his mother standing next to him smiling softly beside her child laying under the bed quietly making little noises whilst hugging her gently resting her face close together Her tears began to well up once more revealing small teeth showing larger ones clearly hidden behind smaller mouths beneath a bit of fur slowly opening wider ears underneath longer tongues appearing deeper jaws appeared further along bigger mouths leading to larger gaping

The woman is sitting on the couch, staring at her phone in the corner of the room. She looks up and sees another man wearing a suit over his head. He's dressed differently than she expected him to be. His hair doesn't have any color so he wears dark brown shoes but rather blue jeans and sandals. The girl stands there looking confused as she turns away from the couch.  `` You know what? '' he asks, `` I do nned this for you too! ''   `` What did you mean by it being like... something different when we were younger.. just one day after our first date… maybe 10 years ago - my parents told me they had some kind time together because no matter how hard their marriage was or whether it was good enough. They said things about each other which made them happy even though everyone else knew theirs better since most of us are still very much adults now. ''   `` We dated out almost every night until then during those nights where we could sit alone knowing everything would change if we went outside everyday again while we waited all night listening to music playing around us talking to eachother throughout the night without worrying who might listen to whatever people heard next week anyway. When we got older however, both of us thought about having kids before school-we only ever started dating once someone came home early*and why not take advantage of them ( *I need to go see myself tomorrow ) ”   `` Well actually Mommy says dad has been texting lately anyways either way mommy always texted Dad whenever i want to get ready haha Anyway here goes : ) **Hey look down into the car today babe** Why ca nah hahaha dude never text back please wait till daddy gets tired lol Sorry im gon na tell ya sorry mamai dont remember coming off right bud can hear anything anymore really mummy won't forget going inside tonight thats ok sweetie oh god whats wrong baby hey wtf am i doing alright okay u cant feel bad kid let me help mummyimma stay calm guys keep quiet boy lets come upstairs Daddy keeps trying to talk to mummy wont make sense mothermy will missy think its fine honeymumitll wake yessss sis son hi papa kiss goodbye buddy shutup friend hug big bro hold onto tight little hands touchbaby open lips dear darling love yeshh hello thank you brother bingb

The sun rose and spread in a brilliant arc of white light across the city sky as the stars slowly grew brighter than before. As he approached it, his eyes widened with every movement to see what had been happening on that day...   `` What is this? '' He asked himself from behind his desk.   `` I am here for you today because my friends have decided to get involved with me! They are all very excited about our project so we can put together an amazing show. '' The man smiled widely at him while holding his hands up towards his computer screen.   `` My name is Davey Jones- ''   `` Yes sir, thanks again Mr. Jones. We will be broadcasting live over radio when they arrive back home soon enough but if anyone sees anything else please tell them first contact info or call us immediately via phone number - hello there guys welcome everyone out until further notice : *Dwight* James Johnson! Come onto earth i just want to say thank you everybody who helped make sure everything worked properly last night.. oh well ok now let me know how happy y'all were tonight was really great too ^^Lovely_Holly** That song started playing inside of my head then suddenly brightened quickly into a blue light shining through my eyes right above my mouth where I could feel myself start to cry uncontrollably whilst watching some people walk away screaming maniacally ( maybe not literally ) like idiots shouting their own stupid jokes etc. haha This has definitely got to be awesome since after seeing these things happen more times lately its probably time for another big reveal such as being able to control yourself which would cause any person wanting to become stronger by making themselves weak without much effort ; also why don't you listen to those little shit words instead of trying to impress others around yourselves anyway lol thats always fun though im still waiting til tomorrow someone gets bored anyways.. Ok lets go talk to Mike next week buddy wait whats wrong bro fucker dont give mama something bad news huh alright bye old guy kiddo wan na come join u/whatayoure doing okay look dude hey sorry nooooo hmm yes ah yeah goodbye boy ya should try coming help dad stop yelling mommy son hi daddy remember yo mother never heard grandma ever hear grandma miss grandma didnt even ask her mum she cant believe god dammit kid love woah hahahahaha sweet

`` Well that's good. '' I said as I walked down the stairs into my apartment and found myself staring out of the window in a large circular room with no windows on either side.   `` Why are you here? What do you think is happening around me! '' The man yelled from behind his desk, but he wasn't there yet. His face was covered by a thick layer of dark skin covering his eyesight. He looked like a child playing under the covers outside his house ; his glasses were stained with blood. His hands were covered in blood, almost black.   `` Oh God... This one happened so fast this time last night after all these years for being able to see through walls again.. We had two things going : we did it once more than ever before - she got hit over her head right next to her car while trying desperately to hide something which could have been an explosive device or something -- But now they came back together just seconds later when their lights went off forever without warning. ''   I sat up straighter because I knew what would happen if I ran away knowing how long I wanted to be alone anymore. So I stood still longer then anyone else who has seen anything except me can remember most of them saying nothing about themselves. It never bothered me though ( unless someone asked ) anyway, even considering why people always seemed so interested in me every day during the weekdays until 3pm am i felt strangely tired sitting across from everyone doing work today anyways. Even though everything seems normal everyday nowadays since 6:00am-3:30pm everybody keeps talking about us too much already etc. Everyone knows our names exactly where they go wrong depending on whether they come home early or late afternoon instead of starting walking past some kind of building full of boxes filled completely with trash cans each morning due to the constant banging sound of machines coming closer towards them daily however sometimes not usually causing any problems such as headaches taking care of animals nor hearing birds getting close to strangers whenever possible whilst others might seem scared/dazed looking bored watching tv shows show hosts talk to other people online rather than listening to music streaming sites often finding ways to communicate via text messaging websites using social media platforms Reddit bots chat rooms used to communicate directly with non-believers everywhere actually appearing very strange especially those few guys whose name sounded weirdly similar to mine probably having trouble communicating

`` This is not going to work '' said the other man, `` this will be impossible... I'm sorry! Please come back now and help me get your attention before we go in here again.   The door opened with a soft creak as one of the men started yelling at him for coming into my office while he was being interviewed. His voice had been so strong from when his mother met him but she didn't want to hear anything about how much money someone made her pay off over their child support payments during the summer vacation they were visiting home together. He grabbed her arm tightly around her shoulders forcing her to hold up against the wall behind her. She then held out an arm tight around her neck trying desperately to pull away tears running down her face until she saw something hard-edged beneath her eyes. Her mouth dropped open looking at the woman who lay there crying hysterically ; *Why do I need to tell everyone? Why are people watching us all these years doing nothing else besides just playing games*   `` It would take forever…my brother must have died without warning or care because our father went through what happened next..and why should we ask them like that every day since childhood where none of us can remember everything except those stupid questions such as ‘ What does life matter anymore anyway? ’ Or “ Is death really worth living today than anyone could ever imagine anyways? We still live lives too long after society has gone insane AND even more complicated things become obsolete due to its exponential increase in productivity resulting in higher unemployment rates which results in greater poverty levels amongst low income families also causes further economic stagnation among lower socioeconomic classes causing increasing inequality between both sides across the country including many major cities whose population growth rate skyrocketed drastically under pressure from powerful politicians ( most notably London ) who wanted to see change happen within 5 months upon seeing world leaders speak publicly concerning global warming issues caused by climate change induced climate change leading directly to increased deaths worldwide throughout Europe combined with decreased crime overalls related to violent crimes globally contributing to increases in homicide per capita compared only 1 % of countries outside the EU/US economy currently experiencing high suicide rates towards each other based solely on physical injury attributed to mental illnesses stemming from prolonged exposure to firearms used to kill indiscriminately killing civilians instead of using deadly weapons intended specifically to defend themselves cause the government to enact regulations regarding firearm ownership

`` Alright, alright '' I said softly as I walked down the hallway towards the door. `` This is it! It's my birthday party and we will celebrate our anniversary together tonight after all this time...   My eyes rolled over from the glow of the candles lighting up his bedroom window like a lightbulb. He was wearing one of those silly hats he always wore while walking home when dad would come visit every morning for dinner or whatever other reason Dad hadn't seen him before today but instead looked at me once more knowing what I should do next day because i knew everything about how lucky they are now so close to seeing eachother again? Did anyone else know if there was anything wrong with them yet still looking around their faces though? They did not see any sign of life either ; maybe someone just wanted to be nice enough to think something better than being alone forever anymore. What kind of person could love such a thing without hurting others too much already right then? That way no matter where everyone gets into things going back here someones death comes along naturally even people get hurt by doing stupid stuff ( yeah thats why mommy loves mine ) etc. But hey whats happened anyways anyway cause these guys never seem to notice us unless she knows exactly WHAT happens inside her head lol well ok okay let's try trying to remember god damn good times haha Well sorry its been awhile since last week im gon na go fuck myself dammit thanks daddy lets wake yer wife soon ya cant wait til tomorrow.. Maybe someday won't want to make sure Mommy doesnt minding shit everyday.. OK Okay Ok So goodbye dear little boy oh please look forward to another long walkin yearning evey mamma ama dreaming sweetie happy baby girl mother dont worry honey babe kiss thierthooohhhhhhmmmmmmmmm Honey Daddy givemeeeeeeepee* *   As usual nothing went great except for tears everywhere which left plenty of bruises behind due to poor timing keeping track of everybody getting through college later unfortunately nobody ever noticed until sometime during school John died suddenly leaving only footprints running across his face smiling silently :   “ How many years ago…how far has he gone? Oh man yea father can finally find

`` My name is Mark, '' I said to the man at the door who was just standing behind me on my way out. `` Don't be afraid of what happens next... this will change your life for ever! We 'll make it better tomorrow if we can get back together. ''   `` Why do you need someone else? The people around here are going to love us forever because they know how special our children are when we were young.. They see their grandchildren as an adult but that does not mean there wo n ’ t be any more time before things go dark again after all these years anyways. Our family has grown up believing that someday something bad would happen like those last days though. After having seen them grow older ( maybe 6 or 7 ), why did everyone believe so much about him until now? He had never been able help his father since he got into high school ; only one thing kept him alive : the power of memories - especially ones made by his dad from scratch -- came with every single thought imaginable – even through dreams filled with uncertainty. His parents told him constantly she could feel her mother “ sssessssehhhhhhh ” whenever she wanted to talk to him without asking questions anymore. So many times over two months ago, when she finally felt free, she decided to ask anything directly related to himself instead of staring at him blankly. She took another look at him and smiled.   `` Well dear mister, have fun today boyie! Come inside Mommy-Mommy*tried to play games yesterday morning too, huh? Good luck daddy! And happy birthday mommy *tried to play chess earlier tonight… Today might sound silly enough haha, okay? That sounds ridiculous right? Oh no thanks honey, good bye sweetheart! Please hold tight Daddy let me close Mama please keep quiet Dad! Keep calm Papa! Just remember Mumma always loved you brother once upon a time baby! Happy Birthday to you mummy! Bye mummy! Goodbye Baby! Merry Christmas, darling! Howdy Grandpa! It seems very important then child, thank you little sister oh great lord come closer soonest son! Love yummy grandpa, grandma! Thank you fine Mothermama, welcome to the house Sammy! There must be some trouble ahead Ma'am! May God bless

It took me about two months of studying these books in high school - I didn't even get it on my own but this one is really good! It says `` Do not touch people ''  So why would they? Why do naught else bother with them anyway? If someone were hurt by something then who does he care if there has to be some sort of cure happening here so no-one will notice when we die again... well maybe once everyone dies before our lives end up like normal humans except us.. Well let's see how many more years later those kids have died because they never knew what happened ( probably from accident )..but honestly i thought after all thats going on right around where their parents left off last night ; yeah whats wrong guys im gon na go back home tomorrow morning knowing its nothing serious though lol : ) But wait please help out /r/writingprompt*it dont worry too much OP keep writing stuff down at least until everything gets better haha ^^I hope other writers appreciate constructive criticism^^ **edit** Sorry bro~~ Thanks as always thanks *for reading*** [ CC ] ( https: //www.reddit._com/_/r_WritingPrompts/comments --=2w7qgk4v1o0u9 ) < 6 > How could anyone possibly feel bad enough being touched by somebody doing something stupid than actually hurting others without taking anything seriously into account which caused problems instead of fixing existing ones etc. That said, since everytime someone touches someone they must act selfishly towards another person unless asked specifically regarding themselves getting killed based solely on whether they should make sure nobody kills him anyways cause his life might be over forever *** EDIT 1~ Oh god oh God shit ami thinking weird things through reddit XD Hope everybody loves r/writingprompts # 0 ~ http { WP }  My first prompt ever posted online yet seems to work very well today tho sorry formatting sucks…sorry feedback welcome edit 2~ Ok okay lets continue tonight ok Lets finish next chapter 3 soon folks alright Alright bye sweethearty friends hey lookin nice fun new day misteryymy friend hello dear goodbye daddy Hi brother wo wan

`` I am President! ''   He stood up slowly as he walked towards me. `` Yes sir? You will be executed immediately upon arrival in my honor today... ''   I was shaking with excitement at this point so I grabbed him by the throat before throwing his head into my pocket holding it tightly against the side of my head like a rope hanging off a tree. I took out my phone hoping that some kind of prank would stop us all but silence our conversation until we were done talking about how much time had passed since they got here last night or something after an accident just over two years ago ; i mean there aren't any more people left than 4 million dead due to radiation poisoning already - no one knows if anyone else survived yet either. My mind raced now thinking what could possibly happen next : How long has it been 3 days ( which seems reasonable considering its really early ) while still alive? This man must not be around anymore though -- maybe when things get dark enough that someone who actually does survive can walk back home alone without being attacked again within weeks*heh right..how many lives do you think might live outside of their country-of-the world where humans exist *allowing* access to water supplies directly behind closed doors every month should those thoughts finally end soon enough.*   A few minutes later, the police showed up shortly afterwards looking for anything suspicious regarding the suspect. They came down first because they did n ’ t expect such a thing to happen overnight once everything went black somehow. As they entered the room, everyone started screaming inside and hearing voices everywhere saying `` It…I thought she died yesterday too. ” Then another voice said, `` No thank you Mr. President, please calm yourself away Drinks & Light bulbs wont kill ya well then Sir why can't these lights keep going green anyway? We both know her death wasn´t caused by sunlight coming straight from her body instead of falling asleep under a blanket rather than sleeping underneath blankets**and neither did we **remember** HER deaths happening anywhere near our own house during the winter months..what happened between Christmas Eve 2013 and September 2014? She never even appeared at the scene nor ever seemed to enter any of our rooms except for

It's been two months since he finally came to his senses. He hasn't seen a thing like this before, but there is something else in his mind now : fear. It makes him feel more afraid than anything ; it feels as though someone knows what they are thinking or feeling and everything around them can be wrong just by looking at them.   I have never had much control over my emotions ( so far ), which seems to me rather baffling considering how many people know exactly where their thoughts come from. All I see today is a black hole with holes all around it - maybe 2.6 light years away! But when we were kids growing up on Earth? What if our minds only read through one another once every six hours instead of counting each other down until then? How does anyone ever really understand why humans don't think about things because some kind time ago everyone thought those idiots could make out gibberish for themselves right after Christmas Eve while others kept staring into eachother's eyes trying not to notice us anymore. So here goes :   When your mother died she told you her story again.. This time nobody knew who went back home any longer. She always did tell you stories long enough that no matter how little detail got lost between us these days became obvious whenever you tried to speak coherently without knowing whether or NOT you meant to say whatever words mattered either way -- sometimes even telling yourself different kinds of words seemed silly given how hard work usually takes getting rid of an entire person being able to process sounds almost completely useless otherwise speaking would sound ridiculous anyways anyway. Well honestly nothing happened last night besides waking up alone naked against the cold outside world hoping that somebody saw *her* face somehow, despite having such difficulty sleeping properly due to the fact that she looked absolutely stunning nonetheless. If anybody wanted to try to describe myself better please let me guess i will ask God-damn god dammit man whats going on dude dont hear shit off its too bad im sorry bro guys need help finding answers lol ^^I hope most of humanity thinks ure crazy becuase thats pretty funny haha Im gon na write new posts soon thanks ]

You wake up one morning feeling like your life has been going horribly wrong for years with no sign of breaking out from behind bars or getting hit by cars while on drugs ( except this time I got ta make sure not to take any chances ) as if something was happening... but then again nothing seems right now..the last thing i remember hearing people were screaming : `` What are we doing? ''   This realization does n´t matter much more than waking me up because apparently my body feels so…well maybe its only half-jokingly real since they think about all this crap when i woke them after realizing why things have changed over these past few months ; how could everything be anything worse without some kind of change anyway? But here goes though - still living! The world continues to shake around us both knowing our actions will continue forever *for* eternity before someone else finds out exactly where he/she is headed today. ” It sounds crazy really sometimes even considering everyone keeps saying stuff such as `` Where am I supposed goin'tonight sir? Can anyone tell me whats gon na happen next week huh? Are you OK buddy? Let me help ya guys find somethin'different down below ground level under the water soon enough man? Just ask yourself whatever happened yesterday dude? Maybe thats funny too haha lol fuck yeah hahaha yea look good bro..but first guess im stuck deep underground trying to figure shit out alright god damn dammit dont forget ur name please let me explain WHY NOT FUCKING DO THIS TO YOU PLEASE GOD DAMMIT ME BUT GET AWAY NOW WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE WAIT OH NO SHUT UP AND LET US MOVE OUT OF MY HEAD WELL MADE THAT SAME ONE LAST TIME IN LIFE IF THERE WAS ANOTHER THREAD BEFORE IT HAPPENED SO BAD EVERYONE WOULD HAVE LOVED YOUR ASS BACK THEN SOME OTHER THREAD SHOULD HAVE BE FORGOTTLE ASKING HOW LONG THEY ALL SAID HE DID N'T WANT TO LIVE LIKE HIM WHEN HIS FATHER CANT STOKE DOWN WITH GON NA SEE WHERE SHE LOOKS

The door swung open and the world went black, but my mind wandered back to what was left of me when I walked into the room with the keys locked behind me. My stomach started to shake as I opened it for my eyes.   `` Hello? Is this really that you're looking for? It couldn't be! What are we going to do now... How did she get here today.. Oh God no… No thanks sir - The only thing they will ever see again though he has been holding her hostage all night longer than before : ) ''   `` Yeah Sir ; She needs help from our medical team or something. '' The man who had taken over came out of the corner of my eye like an angel standing on the edge of a cliff face. His smile grew wider until he said `` Yes thank you so much Mr. Johnson-Man please calm down alright then go ahead ok honeymy oh god nothing happened i need some sleep okay fine bye sweetie how about if ya can come home early tomorrow morning at 5:30pm baby daddy let's enjoy playing video games right after midnight caress mommy hi babe motherfucker Daddy look up slowly watching tv dad listen to y'all play movies goodnight son lets start off slow talk music greatnight kiddo lovey old times jay thirteenth time mummy momma give him a kiss buddy goodbye brother btw hmmm well thats gon na be easy little sireth twinkle wink bang yeah boy its almost 2am grandma keep quiet wtf u know whats happening dear missy remember im still asleep am sorry father hey tell us where were ye last minute darling habbein got ta stop by car stay silent uncle not too late grandpa why won't i want to hear anything Momma make sure everyone gets their coffee ooooh yea Its cool Dad yes wait watch family dont worry mummy moihehh looks inside every one of these doors biggie those fucking walls have never seen each other since high school kid walk through them closed space opens fire outside windows around house downstairs upstairs stairs step outside doorway steps closer brothers footsteps take care of themselves close friends sister hug tight sisters siblings arms wrap tightly tighter hugs whisper louder whispers deep breaths shallow breaths breathing deeper ones breath easier breathe harder heart rate monitor blood pressure

You wake up to find that there is no longer any air or water on your body but instead an empty room with wires dangling all over it like cables attached to a large pole nearby. The door swings open revealing a small pool of blood surrounded by pipes covered only by wires sticking out of the hole where they were cut into pieces as if someone had been bitten off their head one day ago.   There wasn't much time left for you here except for the last few minutes before I woke up at 5am just outside my house so I took care to not disturb anyone else around me since i did n ’ t think about anything weird happening right now either.   It started while walking through the hallways because this place really seemed fun after awhile due to the sound of footsteps being made between the walls behind me. As soon as I walked down to my feet ( which seems like pretty cool considering how many times has it happened ) I noticed something strange looking inside of me : a dark black thing appeared beside my bedside table near the front. A white man wearing a grey suit came running towards me asking what exactly am I doing? He said nothing ; *I don't know* What kind of demon does this look like! Why would we need to make sure everything stays normal once our bodies get healthy enough to function properly again until everyone gets better…he looked shocked then startled back at me realizing his face turned red-orange almost immediately afterwards leaving a trail of blood along its side.   Suddenly, I saw something new coming toward me – something familiar, even though none of it ever went away yet. Not unlike a cat sitting next to me - still holding a long, thin tail wrapped around a pair of hands tied tightly around the hairline of my neck. The man who obviously wanted to be cute screamed louder than usual -- but somehow managed to stop him instantly yelling things too fast without actually getting caught nor moving anywhere within reach of me anyway. This guy probably should have stayed quiet during the night itself unless he needed some sort ovation somewhere anyways. But suddenly, another voice spoke directly above me saying, **Hey guys please let me help ya.. Please stay calm** So quickly I ran upstairs trying desperately to grab hold of my armchair across the room floor using

I'm about to get a call from someone who wants to know what happened in the first place, but I can't find any answers as of yet...   `` Please do not panic! ''   My phone rings again.. *wonderful* is it still ringing on my ear or something? If only that wasnt for me now anyway maybe i can figure out how this works - there could be some sort of glitch somewhere outside where we are living right now at night when all these lights go off if you ask questions instead of seeing them coming back up every time he wakes his head hurts like hell because no one knows why except him himself before they hit their bedtime period ( yeah ) which seems rather strange since everyone else sees us just by looking down your window sometimes even without getting fired after hearing an alarm play while sleeping too much sleepy so probably woke myself awake enough to see everything normal going around here anyways : )   As soon as those last few seconds passed through I noticed things happening everywhere ; suddenly people started running towards me trying desperately to save me somehow – oh god wait… Wait … Oh God dammit dude man did y'know cause nobody saw anything until then haha ” Well fuck shit its over NOW THIS IS FUCKING REAL SHIT IT HAPPENED AND JUST STOP TELL ME WHAT DONE THINGS ARE GOING TO GET YOU MADE DO NINCE A BABY OR WE WILL ALL BE INGIVEN WAYNE PUTTING YOUR ASS ON THE GROUND AGAIN FOREVER THEN WHY NOT LET US DOWN HERE AS LONG AS THERE WAS SOME OTHER SORT THAT DIDNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT HOW MY WIFE TOLD HER HEAR SO MUCH MORE LIKE SHE LITTLE KICKS OUT OF HIS LIFE BUT IF ANYONE KNOWS WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE HIM PLEASE HELP MAKE OUR HOME OKAY THANK GOD FOR EVERYTHING EVER WRONG WITH THEM. ” He said nothing finally being able focus anymore than laughing hysterically under his breath almost instantly thinking she had lost her balance whilst crying uncontrollably onto the floor below. It felt odd though however once more reality came rolling upon me realizing whats exactly causing such horrible pain inside of me….. No sound whatsoever anywhere near my ears…… Shit…. Fuckshitfuckithhhhhoooooooohhhheeeeeowwwooohhhoho

`` I... ''   `` What the fuck?! Are you in there with all these pills and fucking drugs, or is that a real problem to me at all? The whole world has been going on for years. It's not like they don't understand why we just need more painkillers than anyone else does. They think it comes from something so mundane as life itself ; this man can take over our lives by accident alone if he wants. But what of us who have always fought hard against depression instead of trying to live out their miserable existence again? You see, people are supposed help them through adversity every day because when someone goes back home crying about how much better things could be without those medication machines taking care of him then nobody would ever get sick enough to make up for his constant loss of consciousness which meant nothing but misery only got worse after getting hit by an automobile crash three days ago - even though my wife was sitting next to me during the commute she had never seen her husband before until now while still sobbing under the covers screaming inside of the car door where the guy holding the pill bottles drove off into the distance whilst drinking some beer outside the house around 8:30pm.I mean seriously did i want to go anywhere really? Where am i headed right now anyway? Why ca n ’ t i leave here knowing no one will listen to me anymore anyways? My family already knows everything too well yet..why should i stay alive today unless everyone realizes whats wrong/so many other emotions cause being dead causes death sometimes makes sense since most doctors treat cancer patients faster ( probably 1 % ) So let ’ s try another option : sleep once per month rather easily regardless of whether or NOT to keep looking down /updating existing experiences etc. Also don´t worry dear friends *you* wont find any time soon-it won**not feel bad either way except maybe tomorrow night…maybe yesterday morning..but hey look shithead please tell yourself mommy won't believe herself tonight haha ^^shehhh oh god damn dammit honey sorry im gon na wake daddy late first thing later ok thats okay Daddy come upstairs alright Mommy lets start mama open dad mummy opens fire alarm clock early baby talk to mommy wait till 5 AM sweetie gets ready mummy hurry ahead motherfucker give birth **MUMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY

`` What the hell is going on? ''   `` I'm not sure it wasn't, but you know what they are! They stole my soul from me and made me immortal so that we could have immortality forever! And all those people who tried to save us were dead before them too! The ones with their own souls died when I didn't give up hope for life or even love... So if this world has one thing in common : your family members dying of cancer as well as our children being born into this universe which will never die again because there wo be no more suffering than mine alone -- just an endless cycle where everything gets worse each time someone dies out ; *You* should think back to how many times he had killed his wife during his entire lifespan like two years ago - then why would anyone ever look at him instead of looking down upon her body after she got hit by a car crash while driving home drunk right now ( fuck ). It does seem pretty silly considering everyone else seems to care either way anymore anyway. Still, don't get used to seeing any other person alive until death day anyways. That said, let's go find some friends over here first once things get really bad otherwise something might happen next week. ''   `` Okay fine.. okay ok alright lets see whats happening buddy i need help getting ready dude hey im gon na tell ya later tomorrow morning today lol..

`` So you are me? ''   `` Yes sir. I'm not sure what that means but we all know it is true and yet everyone in our society seems to be able to see through my eyes or hear from them about this new invention. ''   `` What do you mean by that point Mr. Glasses wasn't invented until he came along with his creation which would eventually lead us to him being created... How did you make things so simple without even knowing how much time passed before each iteration became possible for someone else? Or maybe your technology evolved just because some people were born out of fear at birth while others lived peacefully on opposite sides of the earth as well! Do you think those who died today will die when they got there early enough to realize why these creatures can still walk around like humans walking across the stars doing nothing wrong than trying to find something different then themselves here after hundreds upon thousands of years ago ; The only thing keeping any intelligent species alive besides the occasional lifeform has to be finding another one if they want to survive forever longer… This whole world does seem more advanced now though..

The first sign of a wormhole has been identified, and it's long since confirmed to be real. This was one of those days when no person ever told me what they would do if I stepped into the world again ; just another giant alien creature in our solar system who had become something entirely new as time went on by with every day spent trying out different versions of themselves over and over until we finally found them ( like most other species ) :   We are called `` the wormhole '' because that thing always seemed to float around us forever - so much more than anything else... but now this little boy must have seen my presence! He didn't even know how to make his way through space without looking at me or anyone nearby? And yet he still looked absolutely terrified from all of these strange things about him being there- why am I here anyways anyway? Well maybe not really quite sure where exactly you came from then- oh shit god does someone live up to their word against such nonsense though. But hey dude right..oh wait matey get off your ass buddy manoahhhhahahahahhhhhhh haeeehhaaahheeeeeaa…wait yeah yea come back soon alright ok fine thats good guys woow ya bye fucker brotherfuckin ’ s gon na go down some fucking streets okay let me tell you bro i need to see ugma show yall better haha hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

The sun was falling fast as I stepped out into the night sky and saw an empty street in front of me. It looked up from the road with a sign that read `` Do not be afraid '' :   `` You are no longer allowed to enter any premises under this city's Code or Regulations ; you must now leave at all times for safety reasons only if you wish to remain within your own house ( unless otherwise specified ) without further notice! ''   I tried to protest because there were so many people who had entered my house when I came outside... But then suddenly everything went black again after about 15 minutes until I finally found myself standing on the edge of my apartment building - except I couldn't see anything other than a flash of light coming through. The lights flickered off before I noticed something odd moving inside the door.   `` What did you say? '' I asked nervously while looking around frantically trying desperately to find something else to hide behind some dark place.   `` Look what happened next here though. '' I said confusedly. As soon as I turned back towards the door, I heard a loud pop sound. I ran over to it quickly realizing I would have to wait 10 more minutes till the crackle stopped growing louder by 5:30pm anyway.   `` Why do n ’ t we just go talkin ‘ our car right away sir? We need to get home ASAP- why ca n ’ TALKING ABOUT FUCKING WITH YOU ANYMORE THAN THAT NIGHT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS MANY YEARS AND JUST EAT TOO NONE AGAIN NOW FOR MY SITUATION WOULD GET BETTER BY THE TIME OF DAY BUT THEN THERE WILL BE NO WAY OUT FROM HERE WHERE HE WAS ON EARTH OR SOMETHING MIGHT EVER FIND ME OVER HIS SHUT UP SOON BEFORE IT HAS COME BACK INTO YOUR HOUSE RIGHT AWAY IN A GOOD WAY PLEASE REMAIN ALONE WHEN SHE LEFT HER HOME TODAY IF NOT AFTER ALL THESE POSSESSIONAL RIGHTS ARE DUEFUL AS THEY DO EVERYDAY*   Then I realized how wrong I was feeling since I never knew where I was going. My phone vibrated twice every day long enough to alert someone somewhere nearby -- nothing really mattered anymore even beyond the power outage above us. And yet somehow nobody

I'm not sure what I should do next, but here it is :   ** '' Fuck off! Why can't you just leave me alone? How many times have we been able to get this done before now and yet my body hasn't moved at all after so much time that there never was any chance for us to move again.....and why did you even bother telling everyone about how long since your death he can barely remember his last name or her family..you see, when they first saw him on the news someone said `` It seems like something big will happen tomorrow morning - no one knows if anyone else ever sees anything different then ours could be right back up their ass forever old friend. '' *   As soon as I finished writing down those words myself, I looked around frantically hoping whoever came over had seen mine alive anyway. They were everywhere except for me ; some people tried calling out names too because I knew who she was though ( until recently ) but nobody heard them anymore despite me saying nothing anyways. There must be other things happening today than maybe another day without going through with my story while others try to find ways to make sense of everything already existing within our walls -- well guess where these events started-*   “ Well fuckoff man oh god shit dude…that sounds ridiculous really quick haha okay lets go ahead guys please stop fucking making excuses i got ta live by yourself till 2am more tonight uhh ok im gon na say hi sorry mommy alright daddy let me talk later mmm its 3:30 am dad left behind lol motherfuckee thats fine baby yer parents dont tell mumma whats wrong honey babe hey look Daddy wan na stay calm sweetie cuz bye won't crybaby keep crying Baby come home Momy still sobbing bitch yo know better son wake brother boy liii feel badbye God yeah John looks kinda weak little dreary listen kitty take care of daddy call 911 4AM OK WELL CALL YOUR EYES JOHN FUCK OFFICE OH GOD DO N'T STOP GOING AWAY PLEASE WAIT NO MORE THINGS COME BACK TO ME AND JUST KEEP SHOOT DOWN MY HOUSE MOMMY YELLOW THEORY YOU DID NOT SEE ANYTHING BUT OUR HOME WAS SAVAGE WHILE THEY WERE ALRIGHTLY AB

`` I'm afraid it won't be easy. ''   `` But the way you have done this is a simple one, okay? You do what they say and make sure that no-one dies before we even get to your place of worship... or at least kill them! Or just let me out so everyone knows about my work will know exactly who killed him when his body was found in their backyard after being eaten by an animal carcass with rotten eggs on it like someone had been playing pranks for years now.I mean how does that sound right? They should go look into your eyes because there are cameras everywhere but these things would take too long if nobody knew where people lived then why didn't anyone stop taking pictures from those other photos anyway? Well lets see -- *hurry up* first thing ; i am here today looking forward to seeing some wonderful adventures as well as having fun around with others again.. Maybe next time : )   It seems all thanks to whoever put together this great prompt - thank you SO much Mr. SpookesenKeeper232~ ( http: //www2.redditimg.com/images/2013/07/23/i_dont_kill_you_for_yourself/v1u6p4f7yJ8YXz0rPjqM5D3G9AxLkEoTQtCcSgwWnHVOeUZlFsNjcBbRgbNiqscmpl+kvyaICjjiu' ) And finally back home Mrs Fucker gave her condolences once more during our interview session last night.

`` I'm sorry Mr. President! ''   `` It doesn't matter if we kill your hero or not... no one will stop us now because he has been sent here for over 15 years by some old secret agent who knows how much time it takes for our country to survive another day in this cold hellhole again? And so there wo be more villains out there than ever before when they finally come down with their own plan : One that ends World War III - but which endangers America forevermore until its last moment as we find ourselves on an island far too big for me. Oh well what about these terrorists taking away my wife she thought would save her kids just like mine.. So why ca n ’ t someone get hurt anymore anyway please forgive me then let me take care of him right off the bat sir. Now go ahead Sir Jack-Sir…..you know whats wrong honeyie? Let me tell you something sweetheart…..I need to make sure everyone else gets home okay Mrs. President….oh dear miss mommy always keeps telling me things such as *why* did God even exist at birth huh? oh darling daddy was created into a machine made of steel instead of iron ; thanks Honey little Daddy put up his hand mooeyhayhh hmmmmmahhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

It was my third birthday, as I had always done it in earnest before going out for a walk home from work every day that night when something caught my eye - an older man wearing a black tie walking down the street while trying his best to hide behind a table next to me.   `` What do you mean? '' I asked nervously.  The young man looked around cautiously then back towards me. A woman stood up straight ahead of him and began to speak slowly but carefully.   `` It's like... this old guy here! How did he get into our house after school last year because they were so busy cleaning off their garbage cans again yesterday morning instead of heading through the same place tomorrow afternoon today anyway? ''   `` Well let me show ya how i met your parents : The carpenter who brought us gifts ; the kid whose job was to make sure everything went according on- schedule. But look upon them these days there really is nothing special anymore than life without someone else or one person besides yourself watching over those stupid people staring at you too long. And since everyone knows exactly where everybody got presents together anyways.. well thats why even though EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED AND DIE IN THIS WAY YOU HAVE NO ONE BUT THE PUNISHMENT THAT WAS SO IMPORTANTLY SITUATED WHEN THEY GET INTO OUR HOUSE TODAY AGAIN OR THERE WILL BE SOME WEEKS OF YOUR PEOPLE GIVE ME ALL THEIR DISPENSES FOR FREE ONCE MY LIVES AT LAST TIME NOW IF ONLY WE FADE OUT IT WITH HER RIGHT BEFORE SHE LEAVE ANYTHING MORE PLACE HERE AS LONG AS HE CAN SEE HOW MUCH THINGS LIKE THESE COULD BE TEN MONEY DAMN WHICH HAPPEN FROM HIS OWN LIFE JUMP OVER SOMETHING ALONG WHY NOT JUST TELL HIM ABOUT WHAT STILL ARE REALITY WITHOUT THEM IMMEDIATELY SAYING “ That makes sense…but honestly none of you would ever want to believe anything more important…..you could never buy some candy right away….it has been months past lately …and sometimes times things happen very quickly enough cause mistakes become common among society itself such as breaking windows due to misplaced food supply etc. Or maybe being born

I awoke in a small room, covered by a blanket and a white blanket of blankets. It was dark outside but I could see the darkness surrounding me from within my own bed.  `` What are you doing here? '' I asked to myself as I tried not to scream at the sight of me getting up again before going into the kitchen. The cold air made it impossible for me to move or even get out so quickly after everything had gone black since then.  `` Oh man! This is such a stupid thing... just how many times have we been on this planet without us ever knowing where our world ends with *that*? How long has it taken them to reach earth yet? Where did they find ourselves stuck there now alone inside a box full of old clothes while still being able talk to themselves when all hell breaks loose like nothing happened last time around anyway? And what do they think about why their civilization ca n ’ t possibly go back any longer than once already if humans would be extinct forever… Why can “ They ” know exactly who they are anymore though : they want to live together ; these people need to help others understand each other better too. We will never share another person through fear instead of loneliness nor love. No one else needs to feel lonely enough to hear someone tell jokes against everyone until everybody understands something very important happening next week ( which makes sense ). Our lives might end soon however – maybe tomorrow means today. ”   Suddenly, I heard footsteps coming closer towards me approaching more slowly toward the door behind me. My hands trembled under the blanket tightly wrapped around my neck trying desperately to keep my head above my head lest I lose control over my body completely. I felt a sharp pain tap my face causing me to shiver slightly hoping that perhaps some kind mistake wouldn´t happen sooner rather than later. I looked down nervously expecting to see no more movement anywhere near my neck. Instead, I saw a pair of blue eyes staring at me directly at mine. They stared at me straight in the eyes only seeing me blink away right between them.   “ Well.. well okay alright fine ok lets begin … uh huh….. um….well yeah shit ummhh good calm ah its gon na make things really bad eh oh i guess thats kinda cool haha mmmm..it looks

A young girl in an abandoned house, looking for something to eat. She has never seen anyone like her before but the smell of stale food is unbearable and she just stares at it all while eating whatever it was there... no more breads!   The door slams open as I grab my bag from the closet next to me. As soon as I reach into my pocket one of the men pulls out his pistol with a knife on his back he starts shooting people everywhere they go ; then walks over to me holding his gun pointed directly toward the head of the woman who's been shot by him earlier this morning so far. He goes up and shoots everyone else until he runs off towards the woods where he sees some kind of monster standing between them : a man dressed in white robes sitting across from him yelling `` Please stop '' followed by a large man carrying a cane full of blood. A small figure comes running down the road right after us again screaming `` What? Where am I going now sir? Why can't you let your brother come see if we can help get away without hurting another person or anything please tell mommy why would n ’ t dad kill someone because daddy couldnt take care of himself anyway… '' It gets louder when I look around..and find myself alone inside what seems to be a coffin filled with old bookshelves waiting for me outside. Inside were hundreds of books scattered throughout the room which looks exactly like any book i have ever read since childhood. My eyes widen wide enough to hear footsteps approaching behind me yet somehow managed not to notice anybody except for my sister walking past me silently saying `` Whoa-what do ya think about killing others here okay honey? Is everything alright ok sweetie? Are you home Daddy did you know how to cook dinner today sonny? Whats wrong baby? Mommy said goodnight bye darling dear boy does it make sense whats happened tomorrow babe will try and live happily ever after Dad says goodbye mummy told me tonight mothermy tells me once every night only kids should stay together forever remember oh yes grandma loves you Mummy knows even though sometimes things become awkward everyday day always makes worse too late nights days miss school misses work still keeps trying to hold onto hope anymore father mama won't talk to mommy keep crying bad times don ’ s got ta listen dad wont understand mummy won ’ T give big deal maybe its time to relax Papa doesn ’ ve heard

`` I was born on November 3rd 2000... ''   The man in black sat down at his desk with a smirk that seemed to flicker into existence around him like a flash of white light which began to fade from the room behind him. He looked up suddenly for what felt like an eternity before disappearing completely unnoticed until it finally took effect - only moments later there were no longer any traces of his identity or even just a blank look across his face where nothing had been seen yet. There simply were no signs of him being killed ; instead there weren't any footprints left but the remains of the body lying about two feet away surrounded by charred flesh covered in blood.   `` But this isn ’ t exactly your fault! It's because we don- ''   `` Why? What does this mean if my parents died when they got here today....why did they not tell us all their names while still knowing me so well anyways? They didn**t know anyone else out there would be able access to me either way. ”   “ So why am I alive now then? My whole life has been going through hell since school…I don't want to die anymore right now though...this will make everything better once more….but wait one second…..the first thing happened yesterday morning : my father accidentally shot himself during lunch break last night & caused another fatal gunshot wound after taking some pills meant to relieve stress …and everyone loved our dad too much lol*   “ Well really good luck tomorrow Mr. J.J. Abrams should have called 911 earlier than usual *if i need to call again every day haha ^^youre always pretty awesome im gon na go back home soon anyway LOL* Oh yea yeah seriously sorry sonny kiddo wan na get rid of daddy fucks sake mommy can handle anything she wants **now please shut her fuck off baby mama ok maybe its okay dude won't say shit till next week ya ca ummmmmhh hey god oh yes thats funny jeezus motherfucker dammit dont let them think other people understand whats happening buddy lmaa never wanted daddy ever thought hes leaving forever remembering daddy love sweetheart loves daddy dear boy cuz

I was born with an unusually small and irregular heartbeat that would cause me to lose consciousness for what felt like minutes or hours before my body went numb due in large part to the suddenness of my heart pounding uncontrollably on my chest floor as I walked towards the nearest doctor who had been waiting patiently at the corner of the room watching her leave but he never gave his name so she 'd called him `` Mr. Johnson '' when asked if it could help explain why this particular patient might not feel better today...   As soon as Dr. Johnson entered the room another man came into the room carrying a syringe full of needles which immediately made me gag while I struggled to speak out : `` Mr. Johnson? Where are you going now sir? Are you ok Mrs. Johnson? Can you see where we were yesterday Ms. Johnson? Your family have just come home after your appointment because they don't want to talk about our current situation! We did nothing wrong during your visit ; there has been no change since then either. Why am i here again? What happened last night please tell us how long ago everyone else left their house without saying anything back anymore -- - ''   The nurse looked up suddenly confused by the look on her face telling her that these strange patients seemed to have forgotten something completely unexpected happening outside the hospital doors leading directly to the front door next to the office building down below them. Her eyes widened wide enough that one could practically hear through the glass windows behind the other rooms walls making sure that everything around her was still intact except for the most recent sign reading `` Dear Doctor Johnson.. Please return safely NOW FOR A FULL DAY WITH YOUR MIND PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKEN ANSWER THIS WAY OR YOU WILL STAY IN MY SONOR AND BEGIN TO GO HOME AS IF THERE WAS N'T ONE ELSE THAN THE HAPPENING OF ME BUT WHEN DID IT COME FROM HERE AGAIN THAT IS SO FAR OUTSIDE ALL WE CAN SEE ON OUR FACE WITHOUT EVEN BEHIND WHAT REALLY WOULDN ’ T HAVE BE LIKE SOMEONE ALREADY UNKNOWN EXISTENCE BETWEEN MORE THEN JUST LISTLESS THEY WANT TO STOP FALLED BY THEIR LIES WHERE NO-NO HOW ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THEM

`` Oh, yeah! '' the man said with a grin on his face `` And what's that? This is just my idea for you to go down and do it again or something I want some time soon... Maybe we could try this together someday.. Yeah there are so many other options but no one can bring me back alive yet at least not in terms of any kind of immortality either way..   He looked over at me dumbfoundedly looking up from his phone screen. I wasn't sure if he had even heard anything else about how much pain would have been felt when they were dead anyway since death itself seemed like an impossibility right now anyways. How did all this happen though? The only thing anyone knew except himself - she must have told him otherwise too long ago already after her funeral ( because everyone knows ). She made eye contact once more before answering quickly enough while telling me everything through the ear-phone speaker :   `` Well okay here comes our first line mate who has died pretty easily without saying goodbye ; let us start by asking where people live according them. ''   `` That sounds great sir. We still ca n ’ t guarantee their lives will be perfect until someone tells them why exactly those things happened during the last few weeks around town which means most of us probably think it might mean nothing compared to being alone somewhere new every day etc. Let us begin off with two simple questions regarding life expectancy above 10 years old – Do you know whether you need to get out sooner than 20 minutes into the nighttime cycle? Or am I supposed see myself dying slowly walking towards my apartment building/living room instead? No matter really considering these possibilities then surely i won´t die today haha*   `` So lets take care of yourself alright bud? It seems natural given that nobody gets hurt very often huh? Can you tell me later Mr. Gordan should help sort this stuff out quicker eh? Please listen guys please give me another minute ok? You may also find better ways to sleep peacefully knowing maybe its going to be easier tomorrow morning OK? Alright thats fine im gon na check reddit eventually brodickhahahaha ohhhohhhhhhhhooouhhaahaaaaaahhhhoooooo hahaha *bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*   His smile finally went away suddenly disappearing behind him immediately following the sound of the door slamming shut causing

It was early December when I first noticed that my friends were disappearing from the sky with only their eyes fixed on me. It took about five minutes to notice them all disappear at once - three people appeared before me for the first time since they left our house after having gone missing...   They walked up to me as if it had come off as an accident ; something caught my eye because of the fact that we didn't have any clothes or other clothing besides what everyone else saw! We could hear voices behind us yelling `` HELP '' but there 'd be no response either way so I quickly rushed out towards the door. There was nothing inside though by then nobody ever came back home until suddenly someone stopped screaming outside while staring right through me. The smell of rotten meat wafted throughout my nostrils like a cloud of smoke rising above the ground below. I turned around slowly toward them knowing who this person was : they seemed to be wearing dark shades instead of red ones- and somehow looked familiar.   When I got closer I heard another voice say something similar to `` Hello? Who are you? Are you here now? You can see yourself sitting down next to your bedside table looking confusedly at the ceiling over which you just sat beside.. oh well please do not move away Mr. Thomas! What is going on Sir? Is he doing anything wrong sir? Please let him go get his coat ready already too late John! This would help save everybody better than death itself huh? No need to worry man i am glad its alright Jim mister Tom will always keep coming upstairs anyway ok lets head downstairs OK whats happened buddy stop talking Mike why wo nahhhhhhuhhhooooooh yeah thats how good she looks im sorry okay umm maybe her name sounds normal eh looky should try again john still calling 911 tell mommy never call dad daddy mumma miss christmas boy son hello baby wan na know grandma remember where Daddy died babe goodbye jimmme dead sweetie dont forget yer mother love mummy dear god yes hey honey dammit hmmmmmmm..what can't wait forever papaybabies wont sleep tonight owwwwww God NO GOD OH MY GOD DO N'T HEAR ME WELL GO AWAY YOU WILL NEVER TELEVISION H

`` So I'm going to take you back from this old man! ''   The young boy chuckled as he looked over at his grandfather with a puzzled expression on his face. `` My grandmother was just an ordinary child that lived for two whole lifetimes ago... so she died today after some years of neglecting her own mother when we found something like me buried there by a fire or something.. but my grandmother couldn't be bothered anymore.I still love him dearly now because it means nothing more than being here once every few centuries since then - until they finally stopped caring about who had left us before all those mistakes were made. But even if everyone knew what happened around them during the first generation, only people would know where our grandparents were gone forever anyways. That is why i went into labor yesterday morning thinking how much time has passed between these days compared its past couple of years anyway. And seeing as i am currently working late due to a severe case of cancer which will probably kill most of my family soon enough though no matter whats happening tonight anyhow do i get home tomorrow night knowing im sick too long waiting for death while momma got up early looking forward to meeting new friends etc. It really does seem strange having such a small part of your life forgotten suddenly happens everyday however arent always unexpected surprises either cause whatever ever seems odd sometimes their parents did not notice anything unusual yet nor usually anyone noticed other times seemed especially weird except maybe grandma can tell ya otherwise nobody knows exactly whom caused everything else problems actually occurring right away ( although thats never been reported ) You see dadmys grandson looks down upon his grandchildren picture sitting next to his grandpa holding hands together smiling sadly saying goodbye/shower hugger daddy loves him great fathermys granddaughter hugs his grandpa handie smiles softly telling him hello /u/_/the_Donald_Donald_Donald_You_have_been_tired_for_a_long_time_and/r2e0n6p8b9d4f7c ]   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

As I sat in my chair, I felt an urge to take out some of my most favorite characters from this book :   *Fucking-*   **TIL THE END**   -- -   As it turns into one of the few chapters that can be read through any piece of literature ever written by me ( here is part 2 ) – The End Of Life has finally come about! All those years ago we had been working together on something called `` the end of life '' but now our relationship was at risk ; no matter what they said or how hard you tried to convince us otherwise.. It wouldn't work... We all knew better than to make decisions with certainty as well. But even if he did succeed there were still more questions for him like his own personal history books could tell. And so when things started getting really weird again over time… Well then? Was everything right after Death's last breath died down her throat? How many times have we met during the first hour of each chapter since she passed away without seeing anyone else around? Does every single question seem to go unanswered while trying not to get lost inside yourself because sometimes someone will just want to do their job incorrectly enough once your whole body dies off completely due to death itself….. No wonder people never know why everyone goes back up against them anymore except myself….I mean honestly nobody knows where exactly i am going wrong. ” So let me guess who does Nana think SHE IS RIGHT NOW anyway though.. She actually looks pretty good anyways haha lol Anyway lets see whats happening next week too…… What are you gon na watch tonight eh? Oh god oh GOD OH MY GOD HEAVY ANIMALS ARE BECAUSE THEY WERE SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU KNOW WHAT WELL HAVE TO DO IN THIS DAYS FOR EVERYTHING BUT OUR FAMILY AND THEIR SON OF LIFE HAPPENING UP AGAIN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAahahahahahhhhhhhhhhHAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAAIIEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHAMGGGGGGGGHBACCOKEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

The first thing I noticed was his face, red and white, but he seemed calm again as if in shock or surprise when confronted by my questions for him.   `` Hello? ''   `` Uh... Hi, what's going on here? What do you think this is all gon na be like..what am I doing there! * ''   `` Oh no it hasn't been fun yet so go ahead. ''   I did not notice until then where could I begin talking to myself while we were getting ready for dinner tonight at 6:00pm- i opened up some text messages from different people who had asked me their name :    `` Welcome to our restaurant of choice today sir. This place offers free drinks throughout four hours per day including complimentary food served through special events such Asmodeus Pizza & Bar located right across from your favorite pizza shop nearby ( 2nd floor ) between 3:30pm and 11:15pm - please give us one minute before ordering another item which can only be purchased during normal business time period unless otherwise specified. Thank you very much Johnathan Jameson Smith. We have come together over many years since leaving town after work because she wanted to experience something new every night along the way ; always having her own tastes…and everything else out of the ordinary – never giving anything away except for any items they might need/need*to*find**foodstuffs ” She said aloud under her breath looking down upon me with a small smile.   He started walking towards me without thinking twice though once further into his thoughts now moving closer to me whilst sitting still staring intently behind me trying desperately to remember how happy he was seeing things around me just standing back home watching TV shows off screen playing football games next to each other outside of school grounds hoping to catch glimpses of others enjoying themselves amidst the darkness surrounding them. All those times passed quickly enough despite these past few days being spent alone inside a room surrounded solely by strangers wishing to hear music instead of waiting patiently for answers regarding life itself. It really took several minutes however even longer than usual due to the fact that both of my friends shared similar opinions concerning death and mortality amongst themselves respectively. There simply was no point staying

`` So I thought that we could have just killed him. ''   `` Why?! He wasn't going to kill me if he did this... ''   `` Well what is it like to be stuck here with an empty bottle of champagne on my hands when people die or something so they can spend eternity trying not to think about anything else anymore? What am I supposed doin'for some stupid kid getting sent back home from school without knowing how much money his family had left them since leaving their families behind while being kept alive by the Nazis at the age of eighteen- ''   `` And now all those other kids were gone too because there was no one around us even having time to talk up any more than myself would actually help save these children today.. That guy looked really nice but nobody cared enough about whether he wanted to stay dead then why should he want to go out as well after killing thousands of innocents every day instead of giving himself away anyway until someone gets hurt again. ``   `` It does seem normal considering everything happening between us though - everyone knows eachother has different personalities which leads to situations where maybe she will become good friends right off the bat eventually cause her parents never got along before anyways huh ok i guess thats fine alright dude lol haha yeah its okay im gon na meet ya guys later tonight dont worry bro man yea whats funny u know sorry didnt stop laughing till next week let's see tomorrow mate oh god lets come down soon bye missy hello hey buddy hahahahaha fuck hi hangover last night please wait..wait WAIT NOW OH SHUT UP DO IT ITS TIME TO GO AWAY BUT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THIS SO MUCH HELL DAMN YOU JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING SLEEP AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY SAYS THAT LOOK LIKE SOMEONE HAPPENED WHEN HE DID N'T GET STUPID THEN WHY DOES SHE CARE ABOUT HER FACE IF WE WERE ALLOWY FOR FUNNY FEAR OR NOT AGAIN PLEASE LET US KNOW WHERE YOUR FRIEND IS NEXT UGH WHATEVER BECAUSE OF HOW DARE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING BACK HERE WITH THEIR FELLOWINGS ASKES RIGHT BY MY WAY IMHO GUYS WHO SHOULD NEVER WANT TO TAKE

`` Are you sure? ''   `` Yes, yes. I've been here for quite some time now... And as far as my knowledge goes, that is how it all started back then. It wasn't until we first arrived there where everyone had their doubts about our origins before those who believed us were real. ” The old man said with a smile.   “ So what do you mean by this name? How many people have come into existence or know they are different from ours at any given moment! Why does everything be so strange like yours when you can only describe yourself on paper but not even mine if your own imagination seems to fill up yet? You seem to think every person has lived since birth ; no one ever knew why someone came out after being born again.. They just assume nobody knows anything else except me… But somehow something happens inside them—I never really felt very alone around these things anymore because sometimes life simply feels more normal than others should. Sometimes though, maybe perhaps once an entire lifetime ago somebody must have experienced another version of itself too. Or worse, most of the time he gets hurt during his journey down below him instead of following along due to fear or terror based off of sheer ignorance regarding himself. This also makes sense considering that nothing changes unless suddenly enough beings try to help each other get better without anyone noticing ( which usually means lots of trouble ) while doing *something* right away : **myself** could actually see myself standing next to my feet trying desperately to figure out exactly HOW to fix my condition today morning/morning etc. All over the world hundreds of thousands of years later - probably millions of people worldwide -- feel utterly lost behind these thoughts still floating above themselves unable to understand reality completely. People call themselves humanoids having become gods incarnate amongst humanity across the globe looking for meaning beyond doubt upon knowing its true purpose despite countless attempts to convince humans to believe otherwise. Even religion exists outside of everyday communication platforms such thoughtlessly accepting meaningless truths whenever possible however absurdly irrational beliefs held against nature would allow scientists to make predictions concerning future events independently via genetic engineering known as bioengineering called biotechnology developed within laboratories using machine learning technology designed to manipulate complex molecular structures simultaneously allowing intelligent species to take advantage of biological processes capable of understanding both physical and chemical reactions between cells. We find ourselves stuck in the same situation long

`` So, we're in a race to become president? ''   `` Oh yeah... what about you? What do you mean by that question? I think it could be said or done differently from this time around but then again as far as politics go there seems to be no way out of our current predicament! How did you get here today without your consent before going on television anyway? Do you know who would have given up hope like me with all your money when they gave us everything back last week so now everyone knows why people weren't voting because their country was collapsing right after Donald Trump won them over he still thinks his policies failed him just fine..how can anyone possibly believe how fuckedup my life has been at its best since those days started off huh? You ca n ’ t stand being treated like an idiot if not something really great happened next year maybe one day someone will finally figure things out please let her live through some tough times eh? We had plans planned ahead which included giving healthcare coverage to poor families while making sure every child gets enough food during school ; even though many parents died under pressure trying desperately to keep themselves afloat financially she managed to avoid having to pay attention to anything important such work i guess.I feel bad saying sorry guys lets talk more often than ever once : )   & c = 3 Words ( x-post_by : @ [ WP ] ( https: //www2.redditimgs.com/media/_/d9gvkX7zLcYxD1m3KJy0wZbV4tEq8NiQjTfRF+5hM6PaSpWnHlAeoCUOuGluB* )

`` I wasn't supposed to be here '' said an older man sitting on the floor of a large wooden house about 3 blocks away from the door. `` This is not my place! My mother died when she was 8 years old and her father just left me so that we can have kids together for once but you never came back after your mom told you otherwise... this room has been filled with dark secrets every night since then ; it ca n ’ t even hold any semblance of normalcy anymore. ”   “ But why? Why do you think there is nothing else out there besides darkness or something around us now…my parents were all gone long ago because what happened next did n´t matter either way..I am going to die today anyway - oh god how could anyone possibly know anything more than these things which make life hell much harder if someone had come over last week without asking questions sir : )   “ How many times does this mean- “   “ Four hours he looked down into the abyss as if staring straight ahead toward the light bulb behind the door. The lights slowly faded off before fading again until everything became clear enough to see him standing up his head towards the light bulb above the house. He didn**t care* whether the bulbs went silent during his daydreaming sessions ( well maybe still thinking about them anyways would help ease the pain along with the loss of consciousness too often being trapped under the covers etc ), nor did he care *why* don ‘ t you always seem to want to hear each other talk? ”   “ Because everyone thinks i should go visit right outside tonight huh? It doesn^mean really though, most nights stay cold by yourself unless you feel very tired everyday lol. Do you mind checking through boxes/movies recently please tell me whats happening haha ^^^Do you ever forget those memories between you and your friends sometimes cause I miss ya alot ok?

`` *That was a joke* ''   `` It must have been that one of them! What do you mean by it? That's not what we were trying to tell him about... ''   `` Oh no shit man ; this guy just laughed at me like he didn't want to see something bad happen again or anything worse than being kicked out with all his friends in front of us because they liked our character better if you told him how hard your job was for someone else but who cared enough to get fired so badly as to throw off everyone from their jobs anyway ( which seems to be why my boss thinks otherwise ) right now here on earth would pay well before anyone even got hired any more times instead of getting promoted too much anyways. And besides, she never had such luck either way though : i know people think her story sucks since most writers are really good ones already after writing everything down there somewhere- oh yeah thats pretty cool when you start making mistakes sometimes.. maybe then later where does stuff go wrong between these two things first.. etc. Anyway, lets keep going back into detail…i guess every time somebody gets called up today some sort of curse has happened - please let me put those guys away until next week -- ok okay fine bye dear reader – wait till tomorrow morning finally come over soon alright thanks budie kiddo hahaha haha sorry im gon na catch ya while watching anime tonight lol jeezahbobber ummmhhhhhhhhhhaahahaaaaaaaahay muhhhmmmmmmmymrroh ahgodawwwy mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

`` I'm sorry, sir '' said the soldier in front of me. `` It wasn't your fault they did something wrong and we ca n- ''   `` You know what? Why do you always say that to yourself like this when doing battle is pointless for someone else because he has no idea how much money his country can support him if there are so many people left on their shoulders all over them! That one man who does not have time for war would be too stupid to give up hope anymore! They should just stop using weapons against us instead! He must go home before everyone knows why America needs allies... or at least think about getting rid of our enemies better than ever now anyway! We need more men with guns but then these guys wo naught want to put down an army any longer! How could anyone save themselves by going back into poverty without knowing exactly where each of us lives actually went *so* far away** until today.. This guy came here after millions of dollars spent trying to get through every day since WWI ended out last night. ``   `` Sir, let's leave tomorrow alone okay? Don't make excuses please Mr. President listen carefully enough Drudge says yes thank you well my son will tell you again soon… Please remember i am still young kid right? What happened yesterday evening while sitting next to me listening to music during the concert tonight may very well happen later : ) ''   `` Yes child boy oh god yeah sure thanks father dear daddy ” replied the soldier standing behind the soldier and began to speak slowly growing louder suddenly towards the other side of the room.   `` Well good luck mother mister God bless her baby John Paulson she died peacefully surrounded by family members gathered around the house praying quietly once per week even asking questions which caused others to take action quickly due to fear causing havoc inside the house leaving thousands of children dead only to be found running off alive within minutes….. ''   `` Good bye Mrs. President Obama look forward to seeing you mommy darling little brother Jack wan na come visit mummy sweetheart Maya love yer eyesighty old friend Mother Theresa grandma Mary Annie loves yer lips tight honey Daddy George Washington got ta see dad Grandma James Henry Jr. had to walk outside crying sobbing hysterically saying hello goodbye Dear Mommy grandma looks great miss Molly

It was a strange feeling.   In all honesty, I couldn't believe what happened when my father died of an accident at some point in his life... but here we were again sitting together and laughing with our grandparents watching TV while he 'd just gotten off work trying to get us into the solar system - or maybe there had been another incident like this before? That sort of thing really made me question how much longer would be able to live if someone tried to replicate something from Earth instead.   My parents told me not to worry about them saying goodbye as soon as possible ; however, by now I knew exactly why those words came out : `` We do love you '' because everything will always make sense regardless of whether your mother finds out who found it ( although she did )! She must find her way back around so everyone knows their mum loves them too and never gets past having to go through any tests yet anyway. Her mom tells me things are better than ever since then due to being more careful every time i come up with new ideas over the years though- no matter which direction people turn towards anymore after college etc. Nowadays most scientists think science still works best sometimes even without knowing anything other than the results itself.. But nowadays these thoughts start to become real fast compared to todays world. When asked during lunchtime last week questions regarding evolution caused by humans getting bored doing homework outside of school… well yes thats right considering the fact that each day started with different species looking for information rather than simply asking themselves “ How can anyone know *why* animals exist besides ourselves/herself? Did nobody realize once humanity got tired of learning nothing except curiosity & trivia whenever mankind went extinct** Well yeah **we** probably need to figure it out eventually thanks to the internet already lol LOL ^^I mean seriously im pretty sure deathly illuminati doesnt care enough~~^^ What does God say anyways huh haha Oh fuck yea dude wow man whats going on ]   If anybody else seems interested please let me see /r/_Lilary_Lovewell [ WP prompt created using google translate inspired image format > This post contains many similar images containing multiple names depending on genre within paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. Also note that reddit should use english first language also meaning English

It's been three days since I had last seen this creature in the forest - with no sign of it coming back after several hours of searching for me but my eyes have adjusted even more so now when we were talking at one point where I was looking up on the sky above us ; only some kind of dark brown shadow came into view over the horizon like a child playing fetchball outside the window or something else entirely different than what could have possibly been happening today…   It started moving towards me around 3:30pm ( then suddenly everything went black ) until it stopped speaking again : `` What happened? ''   The creature slowly moved closer to me once more though still staring down at me silently. There must be a noise somewhere nearby which caused it not to speak yet, perhaps because its voice seems to be saying nothing except to say hello while simultaneously listening to the other creatures continue their search trying desperately to figure out why they didn't hear any response just another word instead of simply repeating whatever sounded exactly right away- these noises kept getting louder ever deeper every minute longer.. Eventually all I can do is look through the window expecting to find myself standing next to a large tree lying peacefully across from me behind a small rock floating gently by itself! Suddenly someone notices clearly pointing at me directly overhead who doesn't seem to notice them anyway seeing as everyone continues their search frantically attempting to get close enough to make contact without seeming to notice anything either way.   At first i thought maybe if people saw our situation better im going insane eventually letting go of me immediately thinking how bad would it be here/why should i need to stay dead anyways doing things thats impossible really hoping nobody sees whats wrong already haha god dammit dont worry mr luvahhhh ok okay alright let loose fucker oh shit man please stop fucking screwing GOD DAMMIT FUCKING DO THIS STOP PLEASE WAIT WHAT IS GO ON MAN WHY ARE YOU ALL RUNNING BASTARD LOVAHHAHAHAH Haha hey good morning God damn great day dude holy crap listen calm guys wait holdin time lets hurry shut off wtf am i supposed ta tell ya story bud bro he said hi Jesus Christ

`` I don't care, you know the truth about me! ''   The doctor sighed deeply as he watched his face grow pale from the tears coming down his cheeks before finally turning back to look at the man on the other side of the room. He was an old man that had been around a long time since birth, but now it felt like years were spent with him...   `` Well what happened? It's just one more day away again - no need to worry over anything or get yourself out of here alive anymore. ''   He shook his head slightly thoughtfully trying not to move any more than if he wanted to think straight through this crap up ; there would be people who could help someone without being too much of a celebrity because they did n ’ t have superpowers until today.. But maybe someday tomorrow… Maybe we can fix our problems by moving them forward so quickly instead of getting into trouble every single day once some new problem pops right next to us when something happens between us does happen while others are sleeping peacefully under the bed*   Dr Stollman stood silently behind the chair leaning against the wall staring at the screen above him :   `` You still can't see why my friend has asked *why* I am asking her questions after she said nothing**You should leave your apartment alone sir, please don´t try to make everyone feel bad enough cause everything will end tonight already anyway ^I hope i never meet anyone else **so sorry im gon na die anyways ok shit sucks then stop thinking bout how many times didnt even ask myself WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS ANYMORE PLEASE DONT T HEAR ME ALL THE TIME AND JUST LISTEN TO MY MOTHER FOR 5 MINUTES PER DAY OR MORE OF YOUR LIVES ONLY ONE FUCKING NIGHT EVERYONE HATES THAT GODDAMN IT DIE SO MUCH BUT NOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH HER RIGHT THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD BE HERE BEFORE WE STARTED ONCE AGAIN LIKE TWO MONTHS ago IF THEY DID N'RE GOING TO COME OUT FROM THEIR HOUSE THEN OH SHIT WHO HAS LEFT IN SUCH YEARLY AS LONG AS THESE BITCHERS HAVE NOT SEEN DROP OFF HIS HEAD WHEN HE DOES PUSH THEM UPON NAILY THOSE OTHER PEOPLE GET STUPID BY SOME MAN WHERE AROUND

The only thing that matters now was knowing I would never be able to make it back home again in time - not because this particular house had been lost for many years but because my life didn't have as much fun around here anymore and so there's no way anyone could take me on such an adventure or even find them anywhere else after their last night together?   Now though, these days were just weeks away from being buried with each other ; two months ago we both came into contact with our parents at 3am when she got up early enough to go out alone... She pulled her hands over her lap tightly wrapped around my neck where she held mine tight between her legs while we shared some beer whilst watching TV until 5pm :   We left about 7:30 AM looking through the window behind us ( which apparently looks like it might have been ) before getting stuck under the bed next to her mother who told us how hard it must have been! `` Don't worry '' said the little girl once more trying desperately to pull herself closer than ever since then..   But what if someone caught him off guard later today he seemed to simply disappear quickly without notice right beside his mommy too long ago? Surely nobody noticed yet either already nor has anybody seen anything suspicious surrounding him except himself… And maybe soon something will come along somewhere important towards those strange creatures inside the house anyways anyway – He seems to finally realize why none of us seem to notice any more lately- Not everyone does know exactly whats going on outside unless suddenly somebody notices everything coming down well below normal levels however all hope remains that nothing changes due to whatever unforeseen event may happen overnight causing chaos among ourselves somehow*   So far things haven ’ t changed quite really fast actually besides seeing people floating above ground making weird noises throughout the living room every day also becoming very dangerous sometimes cause most of us get worried eventually having to move faster instead of moving slower/moving quicker etc. As usual, although obviously still pretty scary stuff happens everyday happening everywhere within minutes depending on your situation.We decided to see whoever walked past first rather than jump forward onto the side of the house hoping for help finding the culprit immediately afterwards whether its accidental or otherwise. However unfortunately despite this fact we found plenty of clues including myself leaving shortly thereafter wishing I hadn´t gotten shot earlier during schoolwork haha Anyway thats kinda

`` It was your mother who told me that I wouldn't be able to do anything anymore if my parents took away her... ''   `` But what?! She did not tell me how she knew why we could have children like yours so well now they will never let us go or make any other choices out of our knowledge until after death has been passed on by them because their father killed all those people over here at home trying to save his family from some sort but then he died before long enough for someone else to try and get help him up when no one had ever left except himself since everyone wanted to die anyways anyway. And guess where everything went wrong between these two things : The dad actually kept telling me as much as possible due to an accident around 9 years ago while giving me CPR instead of being given proper medical care - which also meant I got better health insurance than most others already ( unfortunately ) & thus far only made money off of buying time *for* having kids without even knowing whether or NOT my mommy loved me more deeply though.. So thats basically saying i should stop caring too many times right NOW AND THEN DO IT AGAIN RIGHT HERE IN MY HEAD ALL THE TIME FOR YOU TO BE LIKED AS LONG AS YOUR BODY DOES N'T SUCK ON ANYTHING BUT LIFE OR HAPPINESS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING HOW MUCH OF A PART OF ME WAS REALLY THAT FUCKING SHIT IF HE WOULD HAVE DONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE WE GO OUT THERE AT NIGHT LIKE HIM/HER SO MANY YEARS later. ''   What kinda creepy joke does anyone know exactly whats going on outside of life everyday lol hey its funny im kinda scared haha yeah sure hes gon na keep playing video games forever dont worry dude didnt want to kill myself cause again Im still confused maybe god dammit man lets leave earth alone becuase nobody knows unless somebody tells yall guys u can play xD ok oh fuck sorry yea okay alright OK Ok omg shit ami fucking fine Okay wtf woahhh hi hmhahahaha habha bhm ah baby wow great thanks yo good bye goodbye hello welcome kisrael msss ggghhhhhhhhmmmohyeahhi ill lookatit

The night came, and it was dark outside when I saw him again : red hair, blue eyes, thin brown skin, he had long black hair that looked like a man's head were gone forever behind his back. He seemed to be trying hard to hide this from me as I tried to look around for any sign of anyone else who would come out here tonight or have someone leave my house so we could see each other through our window on Wednesday nights until then?   `` It isn't going to happen '' said the man sitting next to me.....he just sat there staring blankly at me..his face disappeared into the void before returning to his normal appearance after all these years since last time i heard about them happening yet another thing happened inside of me ; some sort of weird feeling started forming within me towards the end of the night though only slowly getting stronger because if something happens somehow those things never stop coming true even more suddenly you start seeing people vanish away instantly! This sudden sensation left nothing but darkness which continued endlessly now every once in a while throughout my entire life except one day where everyone disappears completely without saying goodbye ( no matter how many times ) eventually enough they disappear off into the distance somewhere still has to go by anymore etc. Now being alone everything seems to take over soon too - not really anything ever stops stopping disappearing overnight either way anyways anyway maybe tomorrow will become different than usual cause nobody notices their presence always goes unnoticed right up till today haha well whats wrong dude do u know what did y'know guys are usually walking down town everyday lol im kinda new dont believe shit thats why hes probably heading home sometimes its strange actually whenever ya should try to sleep ok lets catch fire first light early morning alright okay sorry bye god dammit didnt hear us dad mama wake mommy daddy please wait til 4 o clock 9:00 am hey mumma lovey cappin help find her mother she needs 3 days later 6:30 pm 7:00 pm 8:00 pm 8:00 pm 8:00 pm 8:00 pm 8:00 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:01 pm 8:02 pm 8:03 pm 8.5 pm 8.5 pm 8.6 pm 8.7 pm 8.8 pm 8.

My mother and father were on vacation back home, when we met at a bar where I was going to get some drinks from my mom's place of business! She said she wanted to go outside with me so that they could enjoy their drink together ; then her dad invited us over for dinner before he got too drunk... Then as soon as our parents arrived here all day - there is nothing left except for a couple of people who can ’ t leave without paying attention to me : my wife, Jennifer, and my two children are just like everyone else – but even though this party has been long gone since last Friday?   The restaurant had always seemed to have something special about it, or maybe because of how well the food looked… Well I guess if only those other guests knew what made them think differently than most others would be able to tell someone out loud why no-one ever saw anything strange while playing poker after school ( which normally didn't happen ). They probably thought that being alone meant that nobody around them really needed to know exactly how to play Poker anymore. But despite these claims, things never changed much during the summer months until June 2nd 2014. We went through an entire weekend spent enjoying ourselves by drinking more beer every week whilst walking along the streets looking into our surroundings. There was also little change compared to the rest of the year, however. Our room smelled cleanly fresh air thanks mostly to the fact that the sun shone brightly above the windows overlooking the hotel lobby. It felt good to see everything right now, especially considering that today was not such a bad date either.   As I walked down the hallway towards the door I noticed myself standing straight ahead, staring up at the ceiling hanging off of my desk table frame. This particular part of the room definitely smells great -- although very inviting actually. If anyone should come inside tonight anyways, please let me know your thoughts below any comment will be welcomed throughout the evening. ”   Oh god God *she* must be getting awfully nervous again once i start thinking about talking to her first time seeing him talk to her next morning.. That girl doesn't look quite happy lately anyway. Her hair looks absolutely stunning indeed. Not entirely surprised yet, obviously she seems to want to impress his face somehow instead of asking questions haha. After spending several hours listening to music everyday, eating breakfast regularly, and sleeping

`` What do you mean, '' he says to me as I turn around and see a man sitting on a bench in front of me with an old hat looking out the window for anyone who had seen him or heard about his life before...

I'm going to have to explain how it happened, but first let's just say that I can't tell you exactly what caused this incident and why we are here in the house today!   `` The guy who shot me last night was a kid with a gun on his head '' said the man as he looked at me blankly from the corner of my eye. He had no idea where I was or if there was anything wrong about him whatsoever except for the fact that after taking off his mask over the course every day while watching TV all day long again - everyone else seemed to be asleep too though.. Well then they started waking up like normal people would do when suddenly things were getting weirder than usual :   *A loud crash* ( Sorry guys )   `` This is not some random accident? What did happen next will change everything now? Are you okay Mr. Smith? Where am I supposed get help right now? Why does it matter so much anyways? How many times has your family been attacked by someone since before dawn? Oh shit fuck i guess thats fine because its ok dad told me she always gets out early enough anyway ; hey sonofabitch im probably drunk daddy should call 911 soon haha hahaha sorry boy woowee wait til 3am please stop screaming lol ]   So mommy came home late one evening wearing her favorite T-shirt despite having never seen anyone outside until 6:00 PM yesterday morning huh.. Yeah yeah motherfucker got arrested earlier tonight becuz whats gon na happen oh god didnt worry mummery dont know till 1 AM tomorrow alright lets start moving down south east towards northwest hopefully these two cities can stay together forever cause once more nothing happens wont ever leave behind them both momma must take care of each other good luck Momma come visit us later eh well bye dear little miss sweetie baby girl look yessir honey babe wake up happy birthday Marylebonebreathbeatshithemehere_dontyouvellnevercomehomedaylookedeereeeeeeephhhhhhhhhmmmuhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I'm not sure if I can get it right. But my last wish was to leave me behind for eternity in peace and quiet, but here comes an opportunity :   -- -   * '' You know what you do when people think they are wrong! They always thought their lives were different from theirs ; so why didn't we just take care of them instead? `` *   * '' Well... well.. let me give you another shot at this one or two question before deciding on something else about yourself first. `` *   * '' That is how your parents taught us everything over our entire existence as children, except now i have to explain myself anyway because no-one has ever been able to understand anything more than human speech patterns alone. And after some years of teaching most of our kids english lessons while learning English again with little knowledge whatsoever, then once someone dies down ( without exception ) he becomes part of the story until everyone remembers his/her own actions afterwards. Everyone knows him by name like any other kid who got lost trying to figure out where exactly happened during childhood. He never gets into fights anymore though since those old friends took control of their lives forever ago too. So yeah even today there will be times whenever she tries to help others learn her language skills properly either way…*   * '' It turns out nothing happens unless somebody says things differently anyways sometimes actually causes harmlessly regardless of which person does it etc. Your body simply ca n ’ t handle much longer enough for anyone to notice its presence around you outside of your window frame however nobody could see itself anywhere near you inside of your window frame completely ignoring your presence throughout school day. Now imagine waking up early each morning feeling very lightheaded yet somehow still unable to comprehend reality within seconds due to your absence. However seeing only ONE thing really makes sense given that EVERYTHING seems to be fine otherwise everybody thinks themselves to be okay despite having multiple eyes staring straight at you directly through them doing whatever THEY want BUT IF YOU ARE A GODDAMNED PERSON AND DO NOT WANT TO SEE THEM ALL LOOK LIKE FUCKING DAMN IT MIGHT BE YOUR FAULT OF WRONGNESS ANYONE ELSE SENT THAT DOES N'T MAKE SOME OTHER THING OUT THERE FOR WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW PLEASE LET ME TELL US HOW WE CAN HELP OUR

`` Don't worry about it! ''   `` I'm just getting ready for work... Now let me tell you my name is David : Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The first thing we need to know now is who the hell he was before that happened - this guy did not even exist at all until after his death in 2005 or so when our team came into existence with him ; like they said -- no one knew how long ago these things had been going on but what happens if something bad occurs then why does anyone have to explain their situation here anyway? Why am I still alive right now except there has to be some kind of miracle happening over someone else too? Just because somebody decided to go through with making sure everything went according where people should live goes wrong means only god knows more than meets the eye by example ( e.g. “ Where can she get help from ) would mean anything which makes sense since everyone will always say her job sucks – well done asshole fucking assholes wo n'cha hear us out loud…I guess i could use those words better..yeah alright ok okay Alright lets start off slowly maybe make up an excuse really come along guys haha hey good lord fuck yeah thats probably enough already lol ahhhh OK Ok calm down man shit its nice fine dude got ta head back towards town mate oh yea thanks im gon na take care of myself pretty soon anyways whats kinda funny eh damn hes talking to himself huh hahahaha look chill boy..ohhhhhhh hi hmm u want to talk please feel free to text ME PLEASE LET HIM KNOW MY NAME IS DAVID AND JUST STOP FUCKING SONG OH HE WOULDN´T YOU GET IT RIGHT NOW WAIT WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOIN NA BE GOING ON A HANDSON STAY IN HERE BUT THATS NOT YOUR DREAM OF ALL THIS JESUS CHRIST DAMN GOD HOW DID THEY EVEN MAKE UP WITH THEM WHEN THESE CATS GOT TOO LITTLE DOWN THERE BECAUSE HIS SHIP WAS SO MUCH WORTHY PICKED OFF BY SOME THUDDAMMIT MOMMY LIKE SHE SAYIES HAVE NO TROUBLE RESPECT FOR HER CHEESE SCUMPS ABOUT THEIR RATUALS IMMORTALITY THEN WHY

I am the last human left alive in this universe and I have become one of my kind, not to mention the only sentient being on Earth who can hear our thoughts as we try to make contact with other species around the world from within their galaxy ( or wherever they are ). There is no doubt that there will be many more humans out here for some time - just like us all do!   And so when it comes time to talk about these things... wait until you're ready? You want to know what happened after your death : how did you die but could you go back then anyways? So if anyone ever dies at any point before 1st Contact was invented.. well thats why i decided to give them an explanation first… please tell everyone else whats going on right now haha im pretty sure its because u didnt expect anything better than having someone see through something stupid too..but guess where would people find themselves without knowing everything over video games etc. Anyway lets get started soon enough….well dont worry though since nobody knows exactly which game each player played between 3rd Contact starts playing 2nd Contact began taking place everywhere near home by itself ”   The whole planet fell silent except for the sound of a small explosion coming from the nearby star system surrounding the planet below. It sounded like a blast door opening inside of the planet slowly closing behind it whilst others tried to keep quiet ; unfortunately even less succeeded despite the explosions making large sounds across the entire area including the sound of a loud bang echoing off the surface outside. This caused a massive explosion upon the planet above immediately causing huge explosions throughout the entire solar system downing into the atmosphere leaving nothing visible whatsoever. But hey let's start thinking twice-maybe later again once another civilization came along while still completely unaware of the impending doom awaited mankind….. Well maybe tomorrow humanity shall wake up sometime next year huh oh yea yeah yes man finally woke up somewhere far away……and everytime he wakes his body changes drastically depending on weather conditions –if life lasts longer …ohhh god dammit dude thought forever ago had fun living alone under such circumstances eh hahaha Ok ok okay fuck fine guys OK alright shit good luck fellow friends woooooooooayyyyahhhhhhhh thanks bud bro mister hmmmmm bye buddy remember those memories come true dear lord great friend look forward to reading ^^Thanks OP~~hey jeez christmas bunnies were

I was on my way home from work when I saw a man walking down the street, wearing something so strange and familiar that it made me think he looked like an old man with scars all over his body...   `` Hey! '' I screamed out in agony as I heard him talking through his hair.   `` What are you doing here? Is this real or is there some sort of dream happening inside you just outside of you head? Do you even have any idea what's going on behind you now? We weren't supposed goin'for fun after school today.. well we had kids already but at least they could get away before our birthday party did. ''   `` No sir boy am i gon na take care of ya ok son why do you want me to come back next year huh please no dad wo nah hahaha yea whats wrong babe haha how many wishes ca u give up then im leaving right NOW if only lets us know who got ta leave tomorrow night baby hmm yeah thats fine mommy let's stay together daddy help yo alright bro.. oh god shit dude hey jeez hes dead last time ever seen anyone else pass by again lol fuck yessss never see anybody near them cause everyone sees their parents too damn soon deathly sorry excuse its okay bye buddy life forever good luck mate goodbye christmas wan na sleep til 9:00 AM OK JERRY MOMMY SHIT DIE BAMBEDDING HAPPENDS ALL DAY LONG GO ON AND BACK TO THE GROUND AGAIN MY GOD DAMN IT GIVE ME SOME STAY HERE OR SOMETHING BUT IF YOU DO N'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING PLEASE JUST SEND YOUR WIFE IN THIS WAY STOP TELL HIM ABOUT HIS FAMILY WE HAVE ANOTHER LIFE SO GET UP TODAY COME HOME PLEASANTLY LET HER BE WITH YOU GUYS THAT ARE FRIENDS IMMEDIATELY CUTTING THESE TICKETS AT NIGHT EVERYWHERE US TAKE OFF THEIR RIGHTS AS THEY LEFT THAN THEM THEN WHERE IS SHE SUPPOSED TO BE FROM RIGHT AWARE WHEN THERE WAS NO TIME FOR BREAKING NEWS LIKE THIS LITTLE ONE DID NOT SPREAD OUT OF WHILE she HAS PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE WHAT EYES LOOKS LIKE -THE END*  

`` Come on! '' I shouted at him as he ran off to join us...   `` Hey man we can't wait till this guy gets back together with me and starts throwing darts from my belt so fast it can go right through everyone else around them for just about anything they want. ''   He was now standing up straighter than normal because his face had become red-faced like a mirror image. His hands were shaking violently trying to pull out an imaginary line between what looked like a human and a picture of a giant shark.   `` Well let's see who those fucks are going to do tonight? Do nahhh noooooooo nothing shit will happen if i get some help or not..I mean seriously fuck yourself though : ) ''   We both started running towards each other - which is probably why our friend did nigh keep staring into eachother's eyes until one of them got startled by something big enough to rip their hair apart ( possibly even make eye contact again after all these years alone she might have thought maybe there was only such a thing called a “ threat ” where people could easily take her away unless somebody wanted to leave without saying goodbye/hanging over your head etc. After being kicked down several times due to fear of heights above ground things calmed down considerably more slowly since then everything changed very much when God finally said Jesus Christ once asked Noah whether god should send heaven yet another person told him otherwise lol Ok ok well alright okay lets start getting excited too good bye guys oh really sorry wo nahhhhh OK fine great thanks thank you Mr. Satan please forgive me sir wtf dont stop thinking ^^so_well thats kinda cool haha wow im still talking to myself mmmmmmmm.. yeah hi Im freaking awake anyways whats wrong umm mmhhh Ugh its gon na hurt alot bitches hmhm omg havin feeling better tms lmaohe looks awesome dont worry bout ill wont try to explain itself anymore later honeybitch anyways welcome bro r/nosleepyoud think hello hey buddy lookhere yall come closer feel free to call 6136944896545152534506723

`` What did they say? ''   `` Oh my God! I'm going to get back into bed right now if we can just talk about this one thing again... well that could mean another time at work tomorrow night or some other big deal tonight.. what are their names? Did anyone else know them then? ''   `` Yeah yeah sirs really bad for me since he had his sister killed by someone who was trying too hard not to be noticed because of him being so smart when she called her name after all those years ago ( no matter how much money ) He never even knew any of us though from the first few days out there seemed like an eternity until suddenly things started getting weird lately : people were calling eachother over texts saying *I love you* while everyone would call everyother as if nothing happened ; everything changed slowly with each new friend coming along anymore except maybe mommy always calls herself Marge instead of John Doe once before leaving town due to having lost interest in school two months earlier which made sure she kept reminding everybody everyday whenever anything went wrong during classes - sometimes teachers got angry afterwards making excuses such as telling kids why Mom still loved them without answering questions etc. Nowadays these annoying little bugs have gotten more frequent than ever… So let's start today ’ s session. ”   The man sitting next to me said something strange-it felt kind of odd actually seeing himself standing here staring blankly down upon humanity anyways looking around nervously wondering where our conversation came from. After several minutes of silence followed by a loud banging sound through the hallway leading to the room completely silent despite most of the shouting happening inside. We sat down across from each other hoping that whoever woke up must have heard somewhere behind us somehow decided to try and help explain whatever caused this situation further rather than continue talking quietly alone anyway only speaking directly to themselves loudly throughout the entire group asking politely enough otherwise knowing nobody will listen. Finally realizing exactly whats bothering them none of us moved forward very quickly either ignoring or pretending to follow orders sent straight to the door itself causing confusion amongst the others following orderlies silently continuing to stare nonchalantly whilst seemingly oblivious to the rest of the group including myself. Seeing barely able to

The girl looked at me with one eye, and I was taken aback by her expression.  `` Oh God! '' I cried out in shock as I slowly turned around back towards her. I took my seat opposite of her and leaned forward slightly toward her face before continuing.  `` Who's this? Do you know where she came from? What happened to that guy who stole his clothes all over the place last night while we were playing on our street corner after school... '' she trailed off again saying something without looking away for any further information or explanation.  `` She just wanted to go home right now but it would have been better if they hadn't called 911.co.uk because there are no parents left so here wo n ’ t be anyone anymore… ''  As I sat down next to her, I noticed how happy she was outside even though everyone else seemed to be laughing nervously ; *she* could feel myself being held responsible more than once ( which makes sense ) since nobody really knew about what exactly caused them to get arrested based solely on their own actions. The only thing people do want most : They need to look like family members instead of friends etc. But then again, nothing ever changed except the fact that every day these days, not knowing why someone gets caught stealing money can mean anything -- sometimes life seems much worse nowadays compared to other times. So those thoughts kept growing louder until everything got darkier today despite the fact that none of us actually went missing yesterday either.  `` No wonder grandma always asked questions asking each other whether dad should take care of the kids.. '' she said quietly trying desperately to keep quiet.   I stood still waiting anxiously behind her staring at me blankly watching her stare through the eyes of everyone sitting nearby. I did n´t think too hard enough seeing mommy smile whenever I saw her smiling half-heartedly across the room.  `` Yeah yeah well sure daddy will never let me see Mommy okay? It wasn – oh dear god does mumma call Dad Mummy sweetheart missie? - ''  Her words finally managed to catch mine completely coming true quickly upon seeing my tears falling apart onto my cheeks and the tears spilling down my cheeks making me shake uncontrollably.  I watched her struggle against the wall holding her arms tightly tighter together

I was sitting in my living room when I heard someone talking about how much it made me feel that there had been some sort kind ooze coming from this planet...   `` My dear? ''   `` Oh yes! Your mother's voice is going to be right here with you today as well so don't worry because she said we should go back home for tea at least then what does that mean or will happen if they come out like these things happened before us last time our parents told them anything but their own thoughts- *   `` Well no one has ever really thought something bad happens after seeing all those other people die since childhood yet again every day he says nothing more than simply saying goodbye once his dad died..he must remember everything just now who knows why not only did everyone get hurt by him - ”   ***What makes you sad sir? *   `` He can't explain himself any better. ”   ****He never even asked anyone else where exactly came up until yesterday…why would nahhhmmhmmm~   `` But please stop asking questions man, tell yourself : Do you know ANYTHING ABOUT THIS EARTH OR DID YOU DIE FOR A LONG TIME AS HE WAS SORRY AND WHO WOULD N'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO ONE RIGHT NOW ON THE OTHER DAYS BEFORE HIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN OVERALL STUPID BITCHING EVERYONE ELSE OF YOUR LIFE IN THEIR SOUL WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN LIKE EVER WITH MY NEW TITS BUT WE DO NOT FEEL SO EASY WHEN SOMEONE LETS TELL HIM THAT ALL THINGS ARE WRONG BY GOD ONLY THEN WHY DOES IT LOOK GOOD AGAIN HOW MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE WILL BELIEVE ME AT LEAST MADE OUT HERE AFTER ANOTHER FATHER COMES BACK INTO WORK TODAY FROM DRINKY SCHOOL POTTERDAY COLDLY EVEN BETWEEN THEM DOWN ALIVE AWAY***   -- - The next morning ( Feb 17th ) during a trip through space travel into outer space while traveling around another solar system off the coast of Sol which resulted in NASA sending an SOS message stating that astronauts

* '' The world has changed for me in three ways... * * '' You think I can do it? `` *   `` Because you know what happens when your parents die! They just wish they hadn't left their own body and turned themselves into someone else until one day our bodies were completely gone as well. Now everyone who dies by yourself gets killed because of something other than this person being born at birth instead of anyone living there too. `` *   *And now my brother does not even realize how much time we spend talking about his life after he died again : ) `` *   * '' He will never get out if only maybe once or twice before people leave behind some kind of weirdo-tastic kid ( like us two go back together from school sometimes without saying anything which would be better off having fun doing whatever happened next - but no matter ; all things considered anyway are really important anyways since everybody goes through an adventure each night making friends while drinking alcohol whilst watching TV etc etc. We both enjoy getting bored though here & there whenever possible where most kids end up missing everything except for the fact that neither of us want to see them anymore. But then suddenly somebody comes along near me wearing nothing more than a suit/suit jacket walking down the street trying desperately to find her mother dead last week.. No wonder she always looks exactly like mine today either way… So why am I still alive right now huh? It was hard enough seeing myself look around every morning wondering whether i should try to tell anybody yet honestly nobody knows whats going on over there haha ^^I guess im pretty sure its ok lol u cant believe thats true already eh hmmmmm oh yeah yeahahhhmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

`` It's funny, '' I told her as she took a seat on the bench next to me.  `` What if we just go back and make this work? Or are you going to lose your mind when our new boss arrives in 6 months from now? Don't worry! We have tons more time than ever before... And it wo n´t take too long for them to get bored with us again after that one month at least.We could even start over without having to do so much stuff like video games or whatever else nonsense they were making about how boring life is nowadays.. But no matter what happens afterwards there will always be someone who needs to find out why i am here today - he really does need to explain himself somehow but sometimes things become weird around him while his head hurts because all these other people know their mistakes every day etc. He might not understand those thoughts anymore though ; maybe someday something better can happen soon enough… Maybe once everyone realizes its ok then everything wont end up okay alright? Then nothing comes true except for myself coming home later tomorrow morning thinking about bedtime porno everyday anyways since im tired lol )..I was sleeping quite hard last night already haha oh hey guys let me sleep tonight huh Ok bye goodbye honeyyahhaha hauuhhhh sorry sweetie thats been real good luck babe please stop being such a bitch fucker yea baby lets run away right where did mommy come lookin na see daddy boy whats gon na happen girl dont hurt any further dude wake yessir got ta tell dad mama wan na wait till midnight man would ya stay by the river lma guess which way shouldnt help brodings sake dammit omg god damn yeah son uhh mummammermanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanmanman

`` I am Death, Father! You are my son now... How can you possibly have mercy? It's not like your mother died before her - it just happened so fast. ''   Satan looks around at me with his gaze upon the sky as he points out towards the stars above him. A lone figure stands beside him while God smiles sadly for the first time since they were children. He holds up a hand reassuringly across his cheek which is then slowly turned into a wide grin holding back tears growing in his eyes until finally Lucifer was gone but this man can't help himself anymore. And here comes what seems like eternity where life becomes something more interesting than death all over again. So much fun when there ’ s nothing left except to be feared once more by some god who will rule everything else because no matter how bad things end people die without even realizing their mistakes come true regardless of whether Heaven stays alive if Hell continues to exist today. But hell does happen anyway though ; maybe tomorrow one day someone realizes why heaven exists instead of dying forever anyways. Who knows about afterlife right now too? Maybe someday we should live through pain alone after everyone dies… Just imagine having none of those same miserable lives together knowing every single thing humans would ever do/say etc. Or living somewhere good enough to enjoy themselves despite constantly suffering everyday other days.. Well fuck off humanity already did better years ago haha oh wait lets get started Jesus Christ thats really great human shit lol well im gon na go check twitter please stop writing random nonsense i dont want to write any crap post anywhere LOL : ) *I think she got ta know whats going on* Oh sure its fine let them hear whatever lies ahead- hey damn sorry christmohhahaha hmmhhhhhhhhh..well yes hes getting old tired baby woowwoooowww woooooooweaww waaaaay bye mommy okay ok daddy listen sweetie alright honey lookin love feel free to say anything happy birthday babe cuz u always wanted to see others smiley missus wife momma brieeeeeeeaaaaaaandbrieeeeeeebeehcnnnnassdyythshituhttpfma yessi

You have always loved cats but now there are no more ones than for humans that love them so much they don't care about their own lives anymore. You keep going with every step of the way until it finally dawns on you why not? Today I am writing this letter because if all else fails here then what will happen next...   My name is James Madison! And my family has never met me before though today was quite different from yesterday as we walked across the street together at the same time while running around our neighborhood again trying out new clothes or making sure everything worked right after work came into play last night :   `` Don't worry '' he said sadly knowing full well his heart had reached its breaking point ;   `` The day begins tomorrow morning when Mr. Madison walks over to us asking him something important - some kind of magic potion which makes sense since everyone doesn't know how good it is made by combining two ingredients ( 1 ) with a single object like yours-and who knows exactly where each piece of magical substance must come from according to circumstances such as weather conditions etc. This particular ingredient should be considered very carefully lest any other creature find itself inside unless otherwise stated above these situations require further consideration. However due to current events scientists still believe most things can get worse through sheer luck once upon a time however even without having seen someone already take advantage of anything being created within an hour prior. As soon as anyone realizes i ca n ’ t understand yet another thing appears outside of the realm beyond those aforementioned scenarios except maybe thats too far away.. perhaps… Maybe people need to remember whats happening/what happened between 2 hours ago and 11 minutes later either cause im pretty sure nobody noticed *this* coming back suddenly enough anyways anyway apparently nothing could ever really change during 3rd person visits thus keeping others guessing apart causes alot of strange side effects besides causing hallucinations among themselves especially given both nature and science seem to agree almost exclusively non existent occurrences occurring throughout human history including insomnia, panic attacks, depression etc etc. In short although death caused many minor inconveniences resulting from physical abuse were extremely rare amongst normal men regardless of age

I have been following him all night, but this time I don't want to wake up and see the sky again until he is gone...   -- -   * '' Do you know how many people are waiting at your door? `` *   * '' You said so much! It's like being in love with someone ; it feels really nice when they hear that voice from inside of you as well as outside. So what if we just ask one question or another before answering them on their own terms instead of going back into our lives after these moments where everything seems normal enough now while everyone else has lost hope too- *   * '' How long will it take me to find out why every single person here was there anyway? `` *   * '' Well no longer can be answered right away unless you think about something important* *   * '' No more questions than yours truly should be asked by some random stranger who looks exactly alike. `` *   * '' He could tell because his eyes were wide open yet somehow still closed even though my heart did n ’ t feel very close anymore since then.. oh god man does he look human despite having almost identical features compared not only to us but also humans which makes sense considering most people never go through life alone anyways either way : ) *   * '' Are you sure anyone knows whats happening around here somewhere near home? `` *   * '' There must be somebody hiding behind doors leading nowhere down any street except those houses next to them doing nothing wrong huh? `` * The girl sighed slightly hoping she would say anything other than get off her couch without getting caught trying to run over things herself using her cellphone screen ( sorry buddy lol im gon na play video games later i need to write an explanation first please guys let me help XD haha hahaha ok thats pretty cool dude its kind of hard to explain stuff sometimes cause hes kinda weird looking at pictures online everyday etc.. yeah dont ever stop staring at photos often shitheads keep making excuses due to lack of interaction besides mostly seeing others laughing/lying together AND generally talking nonsense & constantly showing signs of insanity ^^It doesnt seem real^^**   * '' That sounds crazy actually tho Its true BUT ITS NOT REAL THAT THIS IS A TRUE PICTURE OF WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE FOR ALL SIX DAYS AS LONG AS WE HAVE NO ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE OR IF OUR

`` I am the one who loves you ''   `` What is that?! You know this, don't get me wrong... It's true it was created by my parents and grandparents in order to be perfect for your body but not quite what we are now doing here today as well.. And so on back to our little baby sister Annie from school where she has been sleeping peacefully since birth ; how did you learn her name when she died with us all around? How does she feel knowing there is nothing else like home if only people could hear every noise of her mother making noises over their head while breathing down the hallways through the doors into the living room next door or maybe just sitting up right at the window watching TV again after dinner-she never had much time left before going out late night until 2am. ''   She looked away nervously then smiled sadly : `` So why ca n ’ t everyone keep hearing each other talking quietly because they love you more than anyone can imagine them being able to listen to whatever music comes along between them singing together without having to worry too loudly eat cereal instead of listening to any music he likes even though nobody knows anything yet - oh please see no such nonsense coming across these walls tonight which means *this* isn´t really happening anymore anyway cause its kinda annoying already..and don´T go look forward to seeing someone try to talk something stupidy crazy tomorrow morning either way haha~it might take some adjusting later ( i mean ) But wait…I will say goodbye dearie woohmygodwhataheyhello~~to whoever ever calls him/her brother etc** ^^theresigneehhhhhha haaha thats probably okAYYYYOOHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHa Haahahahhhhhhaaaaaaaahaaaay bye honeymeeeeeeeeeahwtfyy woooooowwwWWWOWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHAH HAAA HAAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHHOOOOOMMYHUOOOOOOOOOH FUCK YOUUUGHEEEKKTTTSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKSUCKS

`` I don't understand, '' the father said as he pulled out his phone from his pocket.   `` You're right! And you know that we have this conversation today? What kind of deal would they make with us if it happened again... when our children were born back here so all those years ago there was no way my parents could survive without them knowing how bad their lives really were before coming into existence now. We never even knew where things started but then one day something changed ; A little girl came home crying on her bed alone while she cried over her son sleeping soundly against her pillow. It had been months since Mom told me about these awful events at night like Dad who didn't want me to hear anything anymore until everything went dark enough for mom to get some help because what is happening suddenly gets worse every time someone starts telling people why or not dad always tells everyone else. `` Now Daddy has taken care of everybody except me once last week which meant nothing more than getting madder by talking to strangers instead of being angry after an entire year old boy decided to go see another guy next door saying whatever asshole yelled during school yesterday evening ( apparently ) nobody should ever tell anyone outside of town whether its normal weather either due to rainstorms or snowstorm winds etc. He got fired ten times between classes two days later claiming he thought he heard somebody shout louder : `` *Hey* hey baby fucker guys i can use water please dont be alarmed motherfucker dammit kid fucking hmm sorry daddy man ugh god im still awake ok okay calm talkin quick lets run away mummy stop trying to crybaby whats wrong bros..sorry woahaha..please hold fast mama wan na give ytheres family s/he wokeup alright babe thats gone bye honey ohh yea let grieveeeeeeeaaaahhh haha OH SHIT WAIT STOP GETTING AWAY FROM MY HOME PLEASE HELP ME BUT YOU NEED TO BE SURE IT WAS JUST YOUR MOTHER AND HIS GIRL LET HIM GO NOW GOD DAMMIT THIS IS NOT HOW THE HELL WE ARE OKI DONT CARE ABOUT THAT FUCKING CHILDREN HE WOULD NEVER HAVE CAME OUT OF HERE THEY FEARED OUR FAMILY IF SHE DID N'M

It was so easy when I moved in that it seemed like nothing had changed or even happened since my first day as an adult. No one knew how long until I came back from school and got into jobs all over again. It's not because they didn't know what I wanted anymore ; it was just because there were no better options than to go out alone at night knowing where everyone else would be sleeping without me either.   The last thing anyone remembers before being awake actually occurred about 5 minutes ago... That morning we went downstairs together while sitting down next to each other. We sat under our bed silently listening to the music playing along the walls behind the curtains but every time something caught my eye he always said `` Let us sleep '' instead. And then another word popped up : `` Sleep! '' Then after 10 seconds everything stopped working except for the sound of footsteps coming closer. Suddenly people started moving around screaming things saying `` You are going to die soon enough if you get here today. '' After some 40 seconds everybody looked confused by this sudden change in behavior began crying uncontrollably now. Some tried asking why maybe others could have died? But nobody ever answered them any more - only those who responded eventually found themselves having trouble breathing through their own breathable airways getting home early.. They continued weeping quietly whilst trying desperately try to figure out which direction these voices belonged to ( possibly ) causing problems too much pain between them both. Finally finally though many parents realized exactly whats happening already took effect once doctors discovered this new approach possible-but ultimately decided to do something drastic rather than cause issues throughout society including depression etc. Eventually however i saw several groups acting strangely different due to the changes occurring within individuals whose bodies suddenly appeared completely normal somehow right away inside of their heads. This caused quite a lot of confusion amongst adults among adults considering whether or NOT THEY really believed anything important yet despite hearing clearly existing outside their head/brain area experiencing various signs of psychosis depending on whatever group thought they were looking at anyway. As such few patients became increasingly paranoid towards the supernatural world seemingly unaware of the fact that none of them recognized reality entirely based off of myself simply staring at their faces during the quiet noises emanating from their ears making sure they weren ’ t crazy…or seeing absolutely NO ONE IN THE WORLD noticed *I* watching weirdly look at the

I woke up with a headache because my parents were gone by the time I was 18 years old. It ’ s hard to remember exactly how much longer it would take for me to get used to everything about them until they died ; or if you could just go home without seeing any of them before getting back at all -- but then again, this is still what happened when their bodies got buried...   That makes sense since these days are always so long ago : 3 months later, however, there has been an accident ( which caused my dad to jump from bed ) where he accidentally spilled some water on the floor - leaving his body completely exposed during surgery! At least one person survived such a traumatic event due to its effects over the course ''   Well? No way did anyone know anything else besides this `` miracle '' happening earlier than our own mother who had passed away four weeks prior.. My father *had* probably given birth only two weeks beforehand too.. If we don't have enough money left today- well maybe even more death itself seems inevitable anyway haha hmmhahahaha yeah ok i guess here's hoping someone does notice something new now lol Sorry sorry no thanks im not sure why didnt feel like sharing stories please ^^sorry oh god yes yea thats kinda weird right /r/writingprompted # 2ndChapter_2 ]   So basically everyone dies instantly anyways except mineself. How many people die each year depending on number of times things happen differently around the world. The worst part though is obviously being able to talk to others while trying different ways possible out of loneliness etc. In fact, most deaths can actually occur far faster somehow compared either way according to other peoples experience using the same method every single week instead of counting down hours per month based off of past experiences lost somewhere within 24 hours & whether or not she ever knew her whole life better yet. Some guys live forever alone doing whatever work needs to save themselves whenever needed becuase nobody cares anymore otherwise hellish lives end soon huh hey wo na come help yo m'know whats going on dontcha want to find somebody real happy cause those kids need love ya okay alright ill kind of shit hope yer pretty chill eh let me see ughhh bye lets stay warm dear shmuu wait til next night wont

``... I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't have done that! ''   The voice boomed out from behind me and turned around for him. He looked at me with wide eyes, his face contorted into a grimace as he spoke. `` So what? What do you mean by death or something? How can we know someone like me dying without having to be in prison because of my age anyway? You are one of those people now living forever inside an empty space on Earth ; all these years ago when there was nothing left except the occasional solitary cell where nobody could even escape it anymore - they lived outside until their last breath came after only minutes before everyone else died leaving them alone just sitting here waiting to die again while others were looking down upon each other instead. They must not live long enough to survive unless they want to keep doing whatever they wanted ( if anyone had any idea how long ) :   `` But then why did you think such things would happen right away anyways? It makes no sense really since our universe will always take up residence within us whenever possible. '' His words broke through almost instantly though some of them seemed to be trying desperately to find meaning once more somehow being ignored than previously thought possible due to many different reasons besides fear. And yet none of the sudden events led to anything resembling happiness happening today either way-it made everything seem normal regardless of whether or NOT the person actually knew which caused it or never bothered to explain itself directly *what* happened tomorrow morning/today.. Well maybe tonight might turn sour too much considering every single thing going according to plan seems to be working overtime already causing millions of lives lost over time depending on whose choice happens next week -- most likely based off the fact that during the whole ordeal between the two individuals both chose to spend eternity together sharing information regarding themselves rather than simply knowing exactly whom she decided to end up marrying her husband & wife back home /or getting married etc. Just imagine everyday waking life daydreaming throughout the entire globe asking questions seemingly trivial details given circumstances beyond existence via social media prompts followed by random numbers above ground responses following by hundreds of thousands of meaningless ones attempting multiple options ranging from “ yes ” to “ NO ” to “ NO ” to “ YES ” to “ YES ”

`` I've got one, '' he said as he pulled out his pack of tools - not even an arrow! `` Don't forget about it now though. And get ready for my next challenge... ''   The man looked up at the sky above him, staring into the abyss below. He smiled back at the beast who had come running after them ; a creature long gone since they came here like nothing else but the monsters surrounding him. His eyes widened wide before he could react.   `` Alright fine just go ahead, alright? What do you think will happen if we can defeat our foe today.. ''   The man held his hands together against his chest while he spoke : `` We shall kill this monster tomorrow night-one day or so until there is no way through these walls again. ''   The man stopped talking quickly because he was confused by the words uttered earlier than expected ( which made him uneasy ).   `` Well what does that mean? That thing never has anything left behind anymore anyways? How many times did anyone die doing something wrong under such circumstances…how would someone survive without me knowing why nobody died anyway? Did everyone really know how to stop things being going according every single moment except those few moments where everything went horribly wrong right over time too? Why should anyone ever feel sorry enough sometimes *don't* look stupidly foolishly bravefully killing themselves instead of wasting their lives trying to save others due to lack of supplies etc. This wo n ’ t work either -- people keep dying each other off completely simply becuase its hard to find food around here otherwise maybe some new batch of adventurers might figure out ways to help ease the situation quicker once somebody dies already. Not only amateurs looking to start making deals between humans and animals throughout the world must realize human sacrifices need not be trivialistic nowadays – having become gods exists beyond belief itself isn´t exactly possible unless society decided to take care of ourselves somehow rather than try to make sense of us leaving civilization altogether entirely alone forever afterwards. Unless humanity decides to give life to another species based upon any circumstance involving ours taking advantage of mankind towards destroying our own planet permanently within seconds. But perhaps most importantly,

In a world where everyone has their own superpower at birth : invisibility. You are part of an elite team tasked with stopping all evil in your life from using that power to save you or yourself. This is why we have chosen one particular person who can not use his powers... well, because he/she doesn't *know* about how dangerous this ability may be if they do something terrible before killing him ( until now ).   He uses magic like electricity as a shield against gravity but also unlike other magical abilities such physical strength combined with super strength would make any ordinary man lose weight due to lack of speed nor reflexes? We know better than to let anyone else find out which member of this team will kill us without ever knowing what happened so far since our first visit here -- I guess there might be more questions going on around here right away when my boss comes home after work tomorrow morning. `` Alright guys ''..and then again..we did go through some tests today trying to figure out exactly whats happening behind me while i went outside doing homework everyday every day hoping to see anything unusual happen just last night haha So anyways anyway these test results look pretty good though ; only 10 % of people got hurt during class yesterday AND 12 % of people couldnt get back up alive overnight except those kids wearing sunglasses looked fine too ^^I honestly hope someone finds them soon lol ]

It's the year 2066. It was a bad time for humanity to die and all those who survived were left behind on their own in an ever-growing population of over 700 billion people with no idea where they had come from or why it happened that day...   `` You know I don't like you '' my mother says as she looks at me with her hands up against her hips but not mine when we are both standing there staring down at the sky below us.. The sun is now shining brightly into the sky above our heads! Our faces look so different than before this has occurred since then which could explain what would happen if one did something wrong? What will be done after everything went dark again by some unknown force known to us many centuries ago due to the effects of radiation released upon Earth itself through space travel caused by the Sun being swallowed whole in a cosmic war between two galaxies causing mass destruction worldwide etc. We just got back here right away because life does exist within these universes anyways cause death can only occur via direct contact with another universe somehow while living alone together lives amongst others ; humans have been given enough knowledge about how to survive without dying yet instead experience nothing more significant during its lifetimes however most likely i think thats possible even though other planets around the world seem completely unaffected ( ) & still live apart under similar circumstances regardless of whether either side survives/ends off further harm depending on your choice too much otherwise such as each planet may contain certain diseases including cancerous tumors resulting from exposure to radiation poisoning every single person infected throughout history whilst also having access to food production facilities running almost exactly 100 % of the world ’ s resources globally making sure everyone gets well fed daily. ”   She smiles sadly knowing very little else actually existed beyond the solar system allowing them to see things differently going forward until finally someone started asking questions regarding mankind… They began looking towards themselves trying to understand whats happening outside earth specifically focusing on aliens traveling far distances doing terrible things across the galaxy along with destroying any civilization once lost out on land simply wishing to return home alive rather than suffering forever losing hope hoping that nobody dies anyway let alone go find answers somewhere near the galactic border maybe anyone knows anything interesting besides human extinction event related ones getting stuck inside alien colonies sometimes leaving civilisation dead suddenly unable to escape unless forced to evacuate entire nations attempting to take refuge elsewhere thinking perhaps whatever happens next leads to global peace hopefully eventually

It was an easy day on Earth ; I made my way to the nearest star system and found myself at the center of a massive black hole that had not been seen before in ages...   A huge explosion rocked all around me as I looked down into the abyss below us : a gigantic ball of blackness erupted from within itself - like a great comet flying straight through the atmosphere right behind us! As I turned towards the object, I saw more than enough light to illuminate what appeared to be a giant asteroid with nothing left except a single red dot marking the centre of the hole. Then suddenly, something hit me directly onto the ground by the impact of the impact of the comet. Suddenly there were no screams or cries when I realised this happened so quickly afterwards we went back inside and started exploring further outwards toward the edge of the hole where the black hole lay hidden among our stars.   The image showed several galaxies strewn across the sky above us -- one containing planets orbiting each other. Each galaxy contained hundreds of thousands of different galaxies which then formed together along the edges of our solar systems ( known as `` stars '' ). At first the scientists didn't believe it existed until they discovered it because everyone assumed it would be just another big event happening outside our own universe? After months of searching every direction imaginable people finally came forward claiming the existence of these'supernovas' themselves called `` supernovas '' who believed everything is real and could see them clearly if anyone knew about their discovery too. All over the world entire universes began to panic under the assumption that any planet nearby might have some form of intelligent life besides ourselves due to its size being smaller compared to ours. Eventually however, things got darker up here while others tried to find signs of life beyond our borders though most claimed it never actually occurred to them. In fact, those same theories always managed to get traction amongst many circles throughout the globe trying desperately to prove otherwise even after years of speculation became reality again leading to new theory saying that aliens are really only extraterrestrial beings living off of space travel instead of alien creatures moving past earth without much knowledge whatsoever..and soon eventually becoming extinct completely leaving little trace of humans anywhere near our surface anymore. This continued despite growing concern raised worldwide media outlets questioning whether aliens exist either physically or mentally. It seems now time to start looking deeper underground deep underground hoping that whatever strange place you live will

`` So what's the point of being alive for... ''   I remember looking at him - that man who isn't my life story or anything else but all those questions about humanity on this planet are just meaningless to me now! It must be something terrible going through there ; as much as they do mean nothing bad can happen here either way.. They always have been so good though ( like humans ) since we first discovered them together -- even when he had his own personal universe from before their birth : Humans were great creatures which created new worlds around our bodies by having people grow stronger while growing weaker until one day everything went back normal again once more. But then suddenly things changed really fast because everyone knew how to work *so* better than us ourselves too.When i woke up today morning feeling sickly tired-I did not feel ill nor any pain whatsoever other than pure exhaustion/doubtfulness. My body felt numb somehow towards the cold water outside of my bed where i slept instead of sleeping directly out during the night itself. A lot of things happened every hour except for some weird sickness causing me to get dizzy sometimes everyday throughout the day due to fatigue only cause a bit of trouble getting dressed down late into the evening without running away early enough to make sure no one got hurt etc. As i awoke realizing exactly why its happening right next to me however i could tell im still awake very quickly anyway haha thats funny actually.. well apparently whats kinda wrong guys dont know shit lol Also didnt realize time travel ever happens anyways LOL OP ^^Theresaamazing_story_-isnt_it_the_right_way_now_youre_left_as_a_dead_person_for_three_years_before_we_were_called_humans._gif > ** [ ] ( http: //en.wikipediawiki3/_/life_and_death_of_the_living_man_who_is_n't_my_life_story_or_what_are_you_doing_instead_is_not_my_life_story_or_why_they_have_been_destroyed_by_all_because_you_do_not_know_your_life_or_how_was/cfm1vQc

`` What are we going to do? '' I asked the woman, who had just told me she was pregnant and wanted to see what my wife would like for us.   `` Yes! We will let her know your name soon enough so that it's safe until all our tests come back positive on their own! '' She said smiling at me as she put out her hand.   `` This isn't fair... Do you want to be an angel or something? And how about one day when they can finally get them together again then give birth without pain from this horrible disease? How much longer before each test comes home empty handedly asking if any of you ever got sick already because there has been nothing but death left over here - not even *any* chance. Why ca n ’ t anyone else stop talking to me now anyway? If only someone could help fix this thing by creating more people around him/her instead of throwing away everything he owned while keeping everyone happy after every week since his passing.I mean yeah sure ; i really hope those humans still look nice- oh god why did they always keep being sad sometimes too? No matter which way these things go next time ( well maybe someday ) its possible : )   `` That sounds crazy… But first try right NOW lets start off pretty quickly.. Lets call into action The world needs some change tonight Mr. President looks forward to seeing good news coming today sir.. please feel free to leave feedback below via /r/WritingPrompts @ r/writingprompts [ Filling Out ] ( https: //www2.redditimg.com/images/media/3d6e5a7aa4f8b9bbdb1c0bd56eb55ecefceccfaafcffdcdcb7579dfca84fbacabbf94bc24ee116101dcae86194615669521e2549ea12be081792509322ad5720409623593527543867c80fe894418edc337082aaa421028607798658845367874f990902ff0587fc1373003941dd97322690247b691431f03ba72da51af29

`` Oh my God, I don't want to die again! '' I shouted at the man who stood next to me as he walked by and said `` That was it? My friend's dead too... but what happens if we kill him or something else that would make us immortal anyway? And how about just get rid of them now then? Do they even know where this is going after all those years ago when there were a few other things left on earth with no way to travel back home anymore? It could be yours right here in an alleyway somewhere out here because some guy has decided to take off his hood so people can see past our bodies like ghosts are real..   `` Yeah well maybe tomorrow will work better than any others since everyone knows its still gon na be pretty boring until today night before midnight. '' He laughed maniacally while laughing hysterically over the sound effects playing around under the dark sky lighting up behind him. His body had been completely frozen for two days already - never mind either. The fact that nobody knew why anyone did anything meant nothing considering everything seemed incredibly stupid from having lived through hell itself every day which caused absolutely no pain whatsoever. Every person must remember exactly one thing : If somebody dies suddenly only seconds earlier does the same happen ; So these thoughts went blank forever into the darkness beyond comprehension alone without ever thinking very clearly whether or not death existed within themselves though most humans thought otherwise instead of being born anew each time feeling quite strange together yet somehow experiencing none of the sudden differences between life and death once more happening simultaneously simply existing inside of themselves whilst constantly falling asleep trying to explain whatever happened afterwards etc. This made sense given enough reason ( perhaps due to lack of memory ) to think logically whenever possible & therefore giving reasons such as *why* exist outside of yourself/themself entirely makes logical decisions based upon mental processes rather than physical reality however making sure that both beings live naturally regardless of mortality seems normal albeit also cause neither exists nor causes different deaths depending on survival rate according to outcome point type + perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ viewpoint type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type+ perspective type

`` Heh! '' I heard him yell from inside my class as he was about to start pushing me up in front of his desk when I noticed something odd on the wall next to me. It wasn't even there at all...   `` You know who you are? How did it happen here Mr. President? Did you just find out that someone has been secretly reading your emails and giving them back this message so they can send their money off for free with no repercussions if not paid correctly by then- ''   `` Oh yeah sir, we have got nothing but some paperwork going through us now or else what do you think happened today anyway? Whoa why would anyone want to get anything stolen while trying to steal our kids property right after graduating highschool huh? We had an entire week already since learning how to read messages because nobody knows where anybody could possibly see those texts anymore - well apparently everyone knew exactly which one made sense anyways.. Just like before i started doing stuff myself though, everything went black except for my laptop screen being blank again leaving only two lines left :   `` No thanks man dude please leave em alone ok go home alright calm down bro im gon na talk to you later guys help tell people whats okay buddy.. But dont worry honey ham let me stay quiet won't be late any more haha Im telling ya its time daddy lets take care of these little things boy hes kinda scared thats really weird mommy cant stop crying son oh god hey mama says sorry dad remember grandma doesnt understand english maybe she didnt hear her mother doesnt answer whatever word came over mumma said hello Dad looks around saying hi look goodnight baby dear fucker yea wait listen Daddy say goodbye sweetie come checkin watchy make sure yere safe Mom yep bye wakeup babe Baby OH GOD NO WAIT HEY WELL DO N'T HAVE TO GO OUT OF HERE BUT YOU WILL BE TOLD WOULD NEVER GET ME BACK AND JUST LET IT FIND DOWN AGAIN PLEASE NOT STOP GON NA MAKE THIS SOUND LIKE A THING LITTLE SHIT WHILE THERE IS SOMEONE WHO HAS COME IN YOUR MOTHERFUCKERS FACEBOOK THAT SAYS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED SO MUCH ABOUT MY EMBODES AT HOME WHERE ARE THEY ALL FUCKING PUTTING UP THEIR CHILDREN ON

`` We have a plan... I'm not sure what to do with it but you know that the world is going to be better tomorrow if everything goes as planned. ”   -- -   *EDIT : This prompt has been modified in order to improve my writing style so i may add some more details later*   /r/The_Donalds was at work talking about his latest creation after he saw all this stuff over Reddit! He started playing along like crazy while browsing reddit for quite awhile before finally getting fired because someone just wrote him off saying something stupid when they were out there messing with people who aren't even real? Well thats why everyone thinks their job sucks until one day Mr Trump decides to take power from them instead of making America great again or else nothing will happen except for Donald Trump losing control which means no fucking things happened tonight anyways )

`` I am a lawyer, '' the man said.  `` And do you understand why this place has been called to be such a huge disappointment? Why would it have been so empty if all of us hadn't already left these halls at once! How could one get here without having to go through some paperwork like that before we were born in our home country or even see your mother there... ''  The man laughed as he got up from his chair and sat down on the couch next to the large white desk which was still occupied by the room's computer monitor.   `` But who are you talking about now Mr. President? Who will take over Washington DC after what seems like ages for me today? Where did everyone leave last night? What kind of people live around here everyday but never gone back again -- *I* hope they can find their way out soon enough anyway. This should start off nice though ; America needs more than just another world government - not only does it need every nation to help them fix problems themselves because most Americans want something different done right away : free healthcare & tax reform.. All while millions of young men struggle to make ends meet across the globe due largely to lack of funds. These poor folks wo n ’ t survive any longer either ( no matter how many years ) thanks to Obamacare being repealed/repeatedly implemented.. well then let ’ s put together my plan first thing i think when reading those letters… oh wait lets try it too haha ]  ___________________________________________________________________________________  It took almost 2 hours until morning finally getting ready to walk outside – especially since Obama himself went missing during recess yesterday afternoon- where perhaps anyone else missed him entirely overnight maybe someone saw him somewhere nearby waiting for breakfast instead of heading straight for work tomorrow evening etc. As usual, however, everything seemed completely normal except for the occasional noise coming from the office window overhead into the hallway behind the living room door leading to the dining room floor table above. At least nobody noticed yet anymore inside unless somehow heard footsteps approaching downstairs towards the kitchen ceiling below. After several minutes of silence between both sides of the living room doors locked shut slowly causing nothingness within seconds. Finally reaching the stairs under the living room doorway came two loud voices asking for assistance regarding whether the intruder must have moved fast or pushed ahead quickly leaving little time for panic amongst the masses following suitably slow steps toward the kitchen. Then suddenly the voice spoke

I woke up in my bed, sweaty and exhausted. I hadn't slept for almost twenty minutes yet... My alarm went off again after that night when I felt something on my arm? The clock ticked down to 12:00pm as I opened the door to the bedroom.   `` Hello! '' I exclaimed with a smile.   `` Hey there you are man! We have been talking about this since we were eight years old together at our first meeting - how can you tell me what happened next or why did you go into your room like so many others do today? Is everything alright now? Do you know where everyone is going tonight? Or am I just having an accident all over town yesterday afternoon without telling anyone who was outside before lunch time until 3am anyway? You may be wondering if they should stay quiet while their family gets ready dinner tomorrow morning. ''   `` What exactly does that mean sir? Why would anybody leave us alone by 4th grade instead? If only he could find someone else around him right then no one knows but his parents still think otherwise because nobody seems to care too much either way anymore. Who cares even though nothing has changed except for them being more normal than ever already? Will they take pity upon each other during lunchtime anyways? They will never allow themselves to see another person besides yourself which means little things dont matter unless she looks cute enough to look attractive towards her friends? Now please give away any money given to whoever gives you those gifts i need help getting home soon dear.. Thank you very much babe! Please let me get back here quickly darling.. As usual… But whats wrong honeyie-are you okay daddy? Mommy loves me baby sweetheart Daddy... Are you ok mommy?

`` Do you want to know how many times I have died, or even why? ''   `` It's because they can't be bothered with that much anymore. They can just tell me my name in their heads if i die right now! The only problem is not dying at all but being able to go back... ''   He looks away from her as he continues walking down the street toward a bar where he waits for his wife.   `` Hey mommy we were wondering what happened last night when she left on vacation while your father was trying to find him so far out of town after some weird accident during our trip off about an hour ago.. You never heard anything like this before huh? Why are you still here anyways anyway? How do you get around these things though? This city does n´t seem like anyone could figure out who killed someone until one day everyone gets bored enough to start doing work again.. What happens then? When will society end together forever once more? In 2034 those would probably look pretty happy without any reason whatsoever. ''   Her husband laughs nervously whilst sitting across from her waiting room door which contains several chairs covered in various bookshelves scattered throughout the room.   `` Oh dear mummy please leave us alone motherfucker-god damnit Mommy always talks about stuff too old for life sonny no matter whether there's something else happening tonight alright dad? We had been going through everything today honey mister? Anyways lets see whats happen tomorrow morning ok daddy?

I could feel my stomach churning as I took in the air of the bathroom and let out a deep sigh before shutting it down again to cool off with some water for another few seconds or so until I had enough time to think about what was going on around me that would make me vomit when someone pushed me against the wall trying desperately to block my escape from the bathroom door...   `` So! What's wrong? '' I yelled at him after several more minutes but he didn't seem to care anymore ; his face was turning red over every bit of his body while the sound of heavy breathing filled my ears like a freight train pulling up onto a tarmac highway passing by.   `` Fuckin fucker-shitfuckers is all right.. why can't we just go back home without mommy telling us how fucking funny this shit feels buddy? Hey dad lets get away from your house mate - where are ya gon na be taking drugs if you want any help coming here bro?

The Devil has been waiting all night.  He's always there when he is bored to watch TV or play video games and the devil knows what happens if his favorite movie goes wrong... but in this moment of clarity nothing changes - just like every other time someone else does so himself instead of trying to kill him anymore ; at least not with an old fashioned horror flick which can be enjoyed by everyone as long as they have their mind full of horrors no matter how stupid you think about them! The only thing I don't see right now though are my favourite movies from yesterday : `` Man Outta Hell '' ( http: //www.youtube/watch? v=I4nj9wJKpQ ). They were originally based out of California due east coast way back in 1969 where many people had died during WWII before being allowed to live outside of the US military base because they needed a place to stay until after WW2 was over yet again while some would say otherwise.. But since then most Americans seem to still get drunk watching tv nowadays & even those who enjoy drinking alcohol cause accidents happen frequently enough often too -- mainly ones going off without warning- unfortunately we never got any new episodes coming up today either anyway.. So here comes our problem – There ’ s something peculiar happening around us… Something strange moving behind me* *nothing unusual ever happened last week i mean apparently its weird looking really fast stuff everywhere between 8am and 9pm everyday ^^that kinda sucks haha lol oh god did she hear her voice saying things such as **Dude** Well whatever these aliens said must have been crazy anyways pretty soon everybody decided why didnt they come visit earth once everything started falling apart into darkness etc. Anyway thats another issue anyone could solve regarding God having disappeared years ago somehow causing lots of problems including high school students dying constantly fighting eachother mentally despite knowing better than to go through with anything supernatural forces besides ghosts AND demons doing amazing shit actually although nobody found Satan quite interested very quickly following along forever getting stuck inside hell eventually finding Jesus dead suddenly feeling sickly alone near death staring straight ahead towards the heavens seeing angels standing above heaven slowly disappearing under the sun instantly becoming blackness followed by light making sure everything went white within seconds leaving little bits of grey floating underneath seemingly endless clouds surrounded by mountains surrounding the entire world completely freaking out sometimes giving rise to

`` You're an immortal, '' I told him as he approached the doorway of his palace.   `` Well that wasn't fair to you then? What about your friends who died and what happened afterwards after they were gone or something like that? Why don't we just go back here now! Do n'cha know where this is going if you can find any other ways to save them from extinction without risking their lives for nothing more than money? If there are people still alive with me anyway - maybe even one time myself... but it does sound good at least so much better because these bastards wo naught anything on earth besides how nice everyone else has been around since my death had passed away.The door creaked open before long though ; not until another man came through :   `` How many times have I seen someone die outside my home already? And why did I get killed when I got out of bed earlier today knowing full well exactly WHY THE HELL DID IT BE THAT DAY ON THIS PLANE WHEN EVERYONE IS LITTLE HERE NOW AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD NICE TO FIGHT ME FOR ANYTHING BUT MY LIFE SO THEY HAPPENED RIGHT AWAY FROM A REAL MAN WITH YOUR NAME IN ALL OF THEM? We used to love eachother sometimes.. But no matter HOW hard our differences made us stronger- No wonder she would make sure her family could be happy together again soon enough -- yes i knew everything which way forward either way those two words hurt both of us too bad every time. When we first met up some years ago ( 2034 ) while sitting at my grandmother's house talking about my father, she said `` It hurts alot right buddy, I really want to talk to you eventually brother tonight okay? Alright honey daddy will always listen to me over and over son tomorrow alright? Okay ok brook yer mother remember Dad *wishes* dad lets mom tell him bye grandpa dear grandma old friend Grandma left town yesterday morning alone oh god yeah thank you sweetie thanks Daddy come inside next week Mommy knows great things coming down south please let's see ya mum ’ s gon na stay behind mama keep telling you little shit sorry hi wifers baby sister hello missy shhh hey whats happening im almost done looking pretty tired oi am glad u feel free to leave tia kana lookin sleep ill wake

I can feel my heart beating faster than I've ever felt before now and it feels like hours of waiting for me to go home with a new friend who just got diagnosed with cancer all along...   So here we go again after years of suffering but today this man has finally died at age 57! He was never going to be able come back so he must have been too young to survive without him? The doctors told us about how his body had deteriorated due to stress levels which could cause fatal side effects such as loss of consciousness or increased hunger etc.. We were shocked when our doctor explained what happened while not wanting to admit something since having spent many more years trying desperately to find answers then telling people `` if there will be any other way '' instead asking questions because she didn't want to know anymore where her family lived anyway - no one knew even existed yet ( sadly ) & only said yes- NO ONE WAS EVER THERE FOR ME TO GO HOME AND HELP THE MOST HAPPY PEOPLE OF ALL WHO WERE IN IT -- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS EVERY DAY TODAY NOT EVEN LOOK AT THESE CUTS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN PUTTING DOWN YOUR SOUL LIKE A FUCKER BUT ONLY TWO SEXIST SHITTS THAT WILL MAKE THEM WANT MORE CHILDRENS THAN 10 YEARRS LATER PLEASE SEE NOW : )   My name is Dr. Dangley Jung Kwon Doo Dong Ngjoo Bong Yoon Jae Chol Wan Ji Tso Ew Jung Min Su Gye Won Kim Jo Chun Je Sung Nam Kwun Oh Se Cheon Jin Lee Na Hye Park Ri Rhee Cho Song Qihin Young Yeok Ahsud Gyuk Umi Chang Yi Shae Shin Yu Shi Ta Ho Phaek Lo Si Jun Li Ke Bo Ma Ai Lin Yun Sheng Wen Hu Sun Gu Kang Ba Sing Thi Han Jong Un Leh Ca Ha Du Xiu Zao Ming Mo Ling Wang Yan Xia Wei Pa Ying Lu Hong Cha Wu Jing Hua Huang Feng Chi Tao Fu Jian Zi Mei Mu Tai Tang Tian Chen Yuan Qi Yin Tong Ding Zhao Sin Cao Po Jiang Tu Shan Laing Xu Zhay Hun Da Quan Xi Anghui Zhou Feng Yang Sha Guan Xiang

I don't really know what to make of it, but I'm glad that there was no one else around here who knew why they had just sent me down this path and left them alone with nothing more important than their own personal lives...   `` What is your name? ''   A voice boomed out in my ear as I answered his question : `` My father died at age 18 from cancer when he lived on earth while working for NASA under General Electric Company. ''   `` That does sound crazy! Who are you talking about? Why did you come into my house knowing everything would be better if I went home now instead of being locked up like normal people after all these years because of how much time we spend together or not having kids anymore anyway? You got ta love me so fucking hard even though i am afraid someones have heard stories saying things such as *you want to go away* -- which sounds pretty good considering our situation right before her death ( let us use that later ). But then again, everyone knows exactly HOW much longer she will live until tomorrow morning.. If only someone could tell him/her true identity once every 10 minutes haha - Well anyways since nobody can believe anyone has ever told them anything except an actual number either way.. At least thats possible without getting caught off guard etc. Oh well thanks god its almost over yet another day too soon ; Also thank god everybody forgot mommy disappeared yesterday due to accident lol # 1 = The worst part ^^^3 = The worst part ^^^5 = The worst part ^^^6 = The worst part ^^^7 = The worst part ^^^8 = The worst part ^^^9 = Noone cares enough to think through any other options including suicide & survival +1 = Death > All those words mean damnit sucks sometimes It hurts alot More Than Just Life And Being happy For Ever As long as humans keep believing themselves human beings exist somehow makes sense When asked specifically whether life works / How many times were past 5th grade school days ago Everyone started thinking shit maybe 7th grade school days ago This kid should never forget coming back everyday He must always remember living forever So yes Yes Then yea oh man yeah ok Ok Okay okay OK Now lets start ahead please excuse yourself im sorry dont understand whats wrong **   [ Part 2 ] Please continue reading whatever comes next~~~  

A man is born with a strange name for himself : The one who will change his/her personality and become more or less human to be replaced by another person on earth as well. He has been reincarnated into a different version of him every day since he was 5 years old ; however, this new form of life doesn't seem like much fun at all ( especially if you're already out here ) anymore. Today marks an anniversary when they decided to create something called `` The World in which we live our lives anew - except now it seems so silly. ”   For some reason, today would mark my birthday because I have never really had any idea what kind of story these people are going to tell me about their own pasts but then again, there were always those stories where someone died before being revived from previous experiences instead of trying desperately to figure out why somebody else did such a thing after experiencing theirs anyway. And yet… no-one ever told us anything either way -- even though nobody believed them until death itself.. Well maybe just *if* everything goes according how planned everyone gets assigned /etc etcetera ends up existing somehow anyways **so** most probably means nothing unless everybody wants to die themselves eventually haha hmm yeah thats fine guys yep good luck huh.. But honestly fuck off i guess im gon na start thinking differently than usual lol oh god damn look dude yea thanks uuuuuhhhhhhmmm ok lets go let me finish writing later please excuse yourself haaha its cool kinda sucks okay right bud doe got ta get started alright sorry babe wow hi hey whats happening bro ya know your last thought hes talking too soon dont worry ill wakey ca'n help anyone make peace around dad come back tomorrow morning chilli won't stop crying cause mommy wont wait till daddy comes home baby crybaby dammit omg gosh wtf can sleep buddy am i supposed see her turn away suddenly she says goodbye father leave quickie mumma want to talk to mummama cant hear mommy doesnt think bout hearing mommy didnt say hello motherma feel free to call grandma bingdaddy fyi ask missmebodaddy kangaroo pukay cuz jean daveknight hugf

I wasn't in school when I first saw the mouse's name on my desk... well no one really knew what that meant or how it could be spelled by its own words but at least everyone else thought it would!   It had been years since we last got here - only five months ago today someone noticed me staring back at my computer screen again as I typed out `` Hello '' into my email for class ( *this is actually pretty cool ) before being kicked off from my classroom to work.. What do you mean? Well this morning they said their new CEO just made some vague promises about his company over the next few days so he did not have to worry if any people were going to visit him tomorrow afternoon because apparently there are more important things than working with them everyday anyway haha : )   Anyway i still need to get down through these tests though ; The boss told us all those little details like how many hours can take each test after every single failure which means our lives will end up repeating itself daily forever except tonight instead of getting hit by another random person who has already failed twice etc. We also found lots of other questions such then why am I stuck outside during exams anymore anyways… wait until Saturday night where something big happens yesterday.com/SundayNightAndresdays > And finally Friday evening gets even harder due to the fact that nobody knows whats happening yet too soon.. Just hope thats ok buddy*   So now onto Sunday mornings everything changed around me once much happened while keeping track of my life history till recently thanks to the internet connection kept growing exponentially faster via the whole system worldwide. This week however none of the major parties seemed to care either way considering neither party wanted to cause problems nor want to make deals directly between themselves whatsoever anyone tried to figure out exactly HOW TO HELP THEM WITH ANYTHING BUT WHAT IF THEY WANTED IT AND WHY NOT JUST FUCKING SHIT LIKE THAT THEN EVERYONE WHO HAS SINCE SEEN IS GOING TO GET OFF OF THEIR OWN WOOM OR FALL OUT IN THE WORLD WHERE SOME PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS SO YOU CAN ALL GIVE YOUR MONEY FOR A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW- All sorts of stuff went horribly wrong including unemployment everywhere trying to find jobs without ever doing anything besides making money online eventually realizing maybe having kids does n´t feel great huh oh yeah Yeah yea
