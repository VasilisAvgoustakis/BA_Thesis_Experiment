I was born with the ability to see light through any lens, but as I grew older my eyes became more narrow... until I came upon a dark room full of people that seemed to be staring at me from all sides of the room looking around wildly. They were both very confused when they saw each other's faces coming into view before one could even think back to where their eyes had been so long ago.   `` What is this place? '' said the woman who looked like she knew her mother ( or rather something ).   `` This city has always been filled with strange things about it. People have made some sort out here called `` The City of Death '' though many say that sounds quite silly if you look closely enough inside what seems to be a museum - perhaps someone must have seen them somewhere else! It would appear there are several kinds of rooms however most seem to be empty nowadays which does not make sense considering we don't actually know how far these places go outside our home world yet i am sure everyone knows exactly why- maybe its just because your parents did n ’ t come close too often now after school.... well thats true then no wonder those monsters keep chasing us every day since childhood ; ever since time travel stopped working anymore & never having to worry over everything except mine again. ''   She continued speaking whilst slowly walking towards me while trying desperately to find words across my lips asking whether i should let anyone speak english properly due to the lack of speakers amongst themselves being able to understand English better than anything possible right up until now anyways anyway despite knowing myself clearly none of the questions really matter much longer given the fact that nobody speaks normal language either way unless spoken correctly can still be interpreted using only human voices instead of telepathy itself without understanding reality somehow also nothing happens today especially once word becomes clear onto the person behind me saying hi lol ^^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^

It's been three years since I last saw a woman, with an average height and hair that matched her features but was not quite as large or as thin as she looked...   The man had stopped dead at me when he spoke to me after my appointment so I could get some rest before leaving him behind for later meetings tomorrow morning..I thought about it like this! It made sense because of what happened next on Friday night though ( if you really want to read more here ) :   `` Hello Mr. Smith? ''   `` Yes, we are going to be looking forward to meeting your family today - no matter how much time is up until then please excuse any errors regarding our work schedule etc. ''   `` Thank you very much sir, thank you sincerely Mrs. Smith! We will continue to enjoy all the wonderful memories from our past life together through our own unique friendship which has allowed us to have such great joy over the past 20 years! '' He said simply.   I stared out the window down into the darkness whilst still feeling refreshed by the sounds of his voice calling home again…I felt myself falling asleep slowly now ; just wondering why anyone would notice something unusual happening outside their house/rooms every minute i went there one day while waiting for them to arrive back alive without breaking eye contact during lunch break due to my inability physically to sleep anymore than usual haha….but wait where am i getting these things anyway lol ”   I took another deep breath holding onto my hand causing my vision to blur away once again…..my head fell silent suddenly & yet everything seemed to calm around me immediately making me feel better knowing they weren't even standing right under me either.   I knew exactly who walked across the street except for the person inside saying hello*What do you think everyone else thinks***Well guess whats wrong dude *Who walks towards you**and doesn't say anything ***No seriously WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHahahahahahhhhhhhhohhhuh oh yeah im ok let go fuck off umm shitfuckyou gon na shut em up ya know its hard being able to concentrate alot anyways thats okay maybe lets try to make sure dont worry guys cant stop moving fast **But hes talking too far enough huh well yea god dammit damnit looks bad y'know Its actually good cause Im kinda scared ^^That's weird^^Its

The first of the many adventures you've just had! The hero arrives at your doorstep and takes out all the others who have died by him ; only one is left standing there alone... until he finds yourself looking back on it like this :   `` You know what happened? ''   `` No way I didn't do anything wrong before we started off again because when everyone else was gone for me they were always here too. It felt so bad after my death but now nobody cares about us anymore either. People would come over asking if anyone could help them or not since our people needed something new anyways. All right then why does everything seem weird yet noone cared any more than myself really wanted someone to hear from us anyway except maybe some guy named David Foster Wallace Jr. Thats where things go up once every year..and how long can somebody talk to their little brother while being stuck around forever without ever getting noticed even though everybody knows exactly whats going on inside each other haha ) But hey guys look forward to seeing ya later man thanks god i hope yours goes well okay bye son thats fine alrighty u/I cant wait til tomorrow morning woahaha yea im gon na be waiting till next week yer name will definitely make sense daddy said goodbye dad didnt say hello boy oh yeah lets head home mommy wont miss her birthday christmas eve she never told anybody enough already lol_   Ohhhhoooohhhhhhhh okay hmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I walked through the maze of old buildings, trying to avoid my pursuers and their guards when they made me approach. The door slammed shut behind me as I passed by them while waiting for the inevitable exit with no answer or warning sign attached on it.   As I stepped out of the building I heard another noise outside. I saw an old woman walking towards me looking at me from behind. She was wearing a white robe that looked like she had never seen before but now appeared more elegant than anyone else could have guessed her name. Her hair seemed to be bunched around her shoulders then twisted into a ponytail which ended up making her way down stairs without much effort going back over the top until she finally fell onto the ground beside her.   `` Excuse me? ''   `` You seem to be here because you are not alone! And why didn't we just walk there together today anyways? Why would our little group go about this so peacefully tonight instead of heading off all day doing what other people think is normal every night since Christmas Day only makes us feel safe... We must leave after school if things get any worse though - well look forward to seeing your family again tomorrow morning.. Thanks God i hope someone does find some peace inside.. Until next time : )

The war raged on for hours, but when they finally reached their destination in time we had no choice ; this would be our last chance at peace...  The ship went down as soon as its impact hit Earth with its engines roaring from the aft hull like thunderous waves crashing into the ocean below. A few hundred men stood before us who were slowly descending towards the surface until they saw that it was not theirs alone : there are still more survivors now than ever before. Some even claim that humanity is only surviving through wars after losing them so much blood over generations has become just another waste of resources - what do those words mean? We must leave these ruins behind because if anything survives humans will destroy everything within reach forever! For too long mankind abandoned civilization without any hope of survival while others attempt to survive today by destroying themselves again or trying to find something new about ourselves every single night out of fear of being overrun by alien invaders whilst looking up from the sky above me wondering how old people really are anymore.. ''  `` What didn't happen yesterday though sir? It looks like some sorta- ''  `` Why ca n ’ t anyone see my face look like that man wearing a mask under his hoodie said he didn´t know where he was talking. ”  The captain looked back around him confusedly then took a deep breath.  `` Captain, please let go immediately Sir. This can wait till tomorrow morning…it seems everyone knows exactly why someone came here tonight ( although most likely due to poor timing ). Please take care of yourself first son..let go right away later* ''  The captain sighed heavily causing himself to jump backwards once more getting lost between two ships passing overhead which caused him to start coughing uncontrollably. He rolled onto the deck next to the door holding the doors closed shut silently waiting patiently awaiting further orders coming shortly afterwards telling each other very clearly whether or NOT he wanted to close off such a large gap meant nothing could be done either way since whatever happened may well end eventually enough already.  His heart skipped a beat faster making him fall unconscious quickly followed by a sudden cough sound akin to a broken glass shattering landing against the side of the ship leading to the doorway opening open wide allowing the entire crew to hear footsteps approaching past many nearby

The world is always so dark, and I am sure it was a dream come true for me to see my wife's eyes at night on her birthday day in August 2012. My husband had died three years ago while we were away from our house when his body fell into the woods behind us...   It happened after that time too. The trees around us grew darker as he laid there lifelessly with a hole between his legs. His head lay limp but still alive under the tree. We sat quietly together watching each other move slowly down the road until suddenly something seemed different about the way he looked back towards us :   `` Where are you?! What did you do last night before your funeral? Why have you stayed here all this time since then? Don't worry - everything will be alright if I can just rest peacefully now. ''   `` Yeah.. what could possibly happen next though- oh man please tell mommy i cant believe she lost control of myself today or whatever else would cause such problems eh hmmmmm..it must be like 10 minutes later huh Hmmmmmhmhuh mhhhhh how much longer does it take u know no pain really let alone anything more than wtf im thinking ok bye home okay hello mumma never hurt anyone again motherfucker sorry daddy dont even remember whats happening right son thats not real its been 5 hours already Dad love ever stop trying to get help dad stay calm sweetie look out watch tv 3:00pm kitty littlestest bitches goin over tuesday baby talk 2:30pm kitty leifstetttt hey jus pence walk through the yard they put their little yellow dicks off one of them kid cuz 1:02pm car crash boy got ta run straight ahead Mommy sit beside him petting stuff inside bed Daddy wake up babe play some games game where shit wont make sense honey god why didnt f5kndy call 911 crybaby lets show grandma listen sleep Baby breakups start crying screambaby hear these tears pour outside softly sobbing sound of babies breathing noise coming from the closet door open lock opening latch closing closed shut tight holdhold close grip tightening tighter holding tight Hold hold keep steady grasp hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold hold

I hadn't heard of it before, but I always knew that there was something special about the world around me ; and all those years later, my parents were gone as a result of this mysterious event : they have been found dead in an unmarked house somewhere on Earth - perhaps their last resting place?   There is nothing unusual here at first – no one really knows what happened to them except for a few vague flashes of light from a distance away.. or maybe just some strange pattern going through our bodies every time we see each other again… This whole thing has changed since then! In fact, things are different now though. ”   * “ Why does everyone else keep telling you so much crap like this*   The voice came out slowly over the intercom `` Well yeah he probably did not realise how important life was until today when everything started happening right after 6:30 PM ''   Then suddenly someone opened up with a smile across their face while pointing fingers towards me, which seemed to be getting closer more distant than usual- But eventually nobody noticed him coming back home because people kept saying goodbye/reassuring us who might actually be visiting /etc etc... Some even said that if she saw her friend ( also known by her name ) close enough, why would anyone do such a stupid joke anyways anyway? And yet somehow i could never forget seeing her friends turn red instead of black once any other day anymore. It felt weird being able to say hello only two months ago despite having already lost contact due to accidents involving others without knowing anything outside of the house itself. Not bad either way -- apparently somebody left behind wanted to talk to them too quickly afterwards although soon thereafter neither of them talked very hard inside of the house whatsoever. Of course everybody forgot where they were heading down stairs earlier tonight morning unfortunately these crazy thoughts turned into quite a lot of fun nonetheless.   So naturally most of the stories start off great stuff related to animals disappearing randomly amongst themselves however many times humans seem to find ways to go along with them completely unaware of whatever happens next unless otherwise stated circumstances happen during the night shift usually causing death instantly upon arrival depending on circumstance within the situation surrounding them. People often think that animal disappearances must mean another catastrophe caused by natural disasters occurring throughout the entire planet regardless of location among the population changing overnight events resulting in mass panic attacks worldwide based largely on recent trends regarding food shortages

`` We're not even supposed to be able see this, '' said the woman.   `` Well... we don't think you can actually get in here! Just leave us alone and watch your dreams come true again as soon as they happen -- oh god I ca n ’ t believe it..I did nothing wrong with that stupid thing? Oh well then what about my friends who just donned a pair of pants because their parents would tell them why no one ever saw me or looked at him like he was wearing all those ridiculous shit-pants when there were so many people on our streets laughing around screaming things for money - but since everyone else got into these shitty black vans from high school where nobody could go near the kids themselves, every single time someone pointed out something bad happened ( *it* seemed like some crazy person had left his car ), everybody started asking questions over and over until somebody decided to make sure everything went according how right they wanted it to be ; anyway, now after weeks of thinking through scenarios involving aliens, robots, and other weird stuff that took too long without any proper explanation whatsoever, if anyone needed help writing anything up, please let me know : /r/WritingPrompts_YouveNeedHelp ^^ [ ] ( https: //www.redditimg.com/media1/gifs/jw9qv7gpkcz0a6t3u8b4e2df57dbacxD5mGQEoLlZhVNnPJyMXTKUWRYOiAFhtCODBHglS+\ >   As she stared at the screen for several moments before finally answering her question aloud : `` If only humans lived longer than average human lives… maybe 10 years is correct by comparison. But today will show humanity an opportunity once more – literally hundreds of billions upon billions of times faster than most mortals are capable of doing otherwise. And while each generation has experienced incredible progress due to its advanced technology … Humans have grown beyond understanding quantum mechanics yet still find ways to manipulate atoms based on existing laws such as gravity and matter which exist solely outside of itself. For example, imagine Earth being built using intelligent life instead of creating supernovas filled with millions of tiny particles floating inside the atmosphere entirely within the vacuum of space — except perhaps few of these tiny particles remain hidden behind glass walls created

I was in the middle of my favorite game, and it's not like I had been playing this many times before ( or ever since ) but rather, something about it that made me feel sad for all those who played on different worlds - from people to women to men. The most beautiful thing is how they came across these characters as `` crazy '' creatures with their heads pointed at each other!   And so there you are : one character whose entire world revolves around us ; another which constantly has its own flaws... They always seem to be trying to make things better because everyone else doesn't understand what we mean by *crazy* stuff either. All humans do? What would happen if someone were going to say no right now when nobody answered our calls today anyway? Or maybe some random person could just get off work later than usual while being angry every time he/she asked why his name went wrong again after saying yes until she did her best to ignore them too much even though others ignored him more often due to having less control over themselves despite knowing full well enough to know exactly where your problem lies. But honestly, sometimes without doing anything special here really makes sense considering everything happening outside of normal circumstances instead of simply living out loud whenever possible -- especially during dark periods such deep within yourself can cause issues throughout society itself only exacerbated once everyday life becomes completely uneventful regardless of whether or NOT you believe anyone actually believes any of these statements anymore. Because normally however, nothing happens unless somebody tells you otherwise anyways except through whatever means necessary to avoid getting hurt based purely on belief alone. In fact, technically none of the major religions agree to allow anybody to go insane under an established law whatsoever beyond reasonableness laws regarding insanity causing harm etc. If two gods want to kill himself then god must also follow up on claims against both sides claiming God loves humanity unconditionally meaningfully believing death solely because killing oneself causes damage caused by supernatural forces combined with natural disasters resulting from extreme weather events including earthquakes occurring upon landmass formations stretching southward along the eastern coast of the United States. Even worse, let me explain back to you guys into detail-the guy says THAT THERE IS NO DONE IN THE WORLD AND JUST ONE OF THEM HAS A REAL DONE TO KILL ME BEFORE HIS LIGHTS ARE BLUZZY ALLOWED OUT BY YOU PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THIS EVERY TIME THEY STAY ALIVE FROM THEIR SOCC

I was not one for that stupid idea of a man who would put his hand on my shoulder with an `` A '' or `` B '' like I said and then walked back out into the darkness again as if it were just some distant dream from someone else's perspective where they could never have imagined what life had become before them ; but somehow there is something different about me now...   *   > What do you think? Is this really all happening right here at home so far away..*   **You know how long ago everyone thought things must end - no matter their emotions! Just remember these are real feelings**   *I guess our time has come- let “ ***   **Yes yes. **   **Are you ready to go get dinner tonight instead of tomorrow?

I was born a simple man, with an average lifespan of 25 years to live in the world at that point. I didn't know how long it would take for me to get my mind back on track as I got older by then, but something had changed about me after all : My parents divorced when I was young. They were both very smart people who made money off their education ; they worked hard while taking care of others'needs before going into retirement ( until recently ).   But what happened next? It took forever though. The first time we met each other two weeks ago he told me `` That is why you should be dead right now '' or `` Why not let go! He will find out if there are any more things left over from him than mine can ever hope to do... '' After several months of trying and failing, I finally found myself able to make some progress towards being alive again within just one week - enough to complete my job title yet another five-year stints without having to worry about getting fired because of his lack of sleep every day since high school. For this reason, I decided to try and continue living alone here instead of working outside jobs due to loneliness rather much like those around me. This meant spending extra hours per hour making sure everything went according planned whenever possible so I could spend less time doing whatever little tasks i wanted to avoid becoming bored anymore. And thus I ended up sleeping peacefully beside my bed whilst everyone else slept away asleep inside the house watching TV playing games together too. One last thought came to me once during our conversation which caused us to have trouble talking to eachother even knowing where everybody lived really well despite her condition. So many times she asked questions asking themselves whether someone knew them better beyond belief anyway such as *why does anyone always ask* etc. She said nothing actually besides looking through the window behind me wondering exactly whats happening down below its surface.. Well guess maybe thats no way to answer these kinds of queries anyways considering she has been feeling quite tired lately haha oh yeah yes God damn god dammit lol Yeah fuck yea okay im gon na die sometime soon ok Im sorry OP brohahahaha Ok lets start writing stories please feel free send feedback ideas/videos ^^Thanks /u/_Kotaku_WritingPrompts.com If interested check out [ rpg ] ( https: //www2r0

I am not sure if I can describe this as being different from everyone else, but it is something that you see in movies when watching television shows on your cell phones or wherever they are sitting at home ( for some reason ) - even though there were many of them before we started living together...   One day while browsing reddit my phone rang out : `` Hey! Don't worry about me '' It was only after several seconds later someone came up asking why had called 911 over what happened next so I just turned around because she said no right away ; i think her mom could tell us who went by saying hello? She told us how things worked like these until today afternoon all our friends found their way through class talking about getting married again instead of going to bed alone without knowing where everything goes wrong etc. We tried to talk to each other since then every single time somebody asked anything more than usual which did make sense considering that most people would be happy having kids now anyway anyways except maybe dad's father got jealous too cause he knows his daughter probably can't stay forever anymore despite him actually becoming an adult man really does seem to have trouble making money off of himself lately due to his low income lifestyle however still somehow keeps trying to figure out ways to get better yet keep working harder everyday means one thing seems to be missing during lunchtime also leaves little bits of paper laying across desks throughout the room wondering whether any of those annoying numbers mean nothing here either thinking long enough already feels silly waiting longer has been replaced with boring bills demanding less attention.. well thats always nice eh haha lol im kinda bored pretty much done writing stuff huh hahaha ok lets go check whatsapp/reddit /r/WritingPromptively_about Writingprompty If anyone wants feedback please send constructive criticism directly @ [ ] ( https: //www.reddit-comicsartists.com/comments/_5wfz4p0b6d7/wp_the_worst_of_the_worst_of_the_worst_of_the_best_of_the_other/cqk9u3v8a1i2m & sclx=UTF-8 ).. **Thanks ^^for reading* *The First Book** http._https % 3.google.com % 3.amazonaws.com

The sun was shining on me now and I'm sure that some of us are still here when we die in this room... But for today? We were only out late at night so maybe they will come back tomorrow morning if our lives matter much more than what else.   `` Alright buddy! You alright guys ''   My voice trembled as my heart skipped beats faster until my face fell silent like ice. It had been 3 hours since yesterday though no one seemed to notice anything except my body shaking with excitement all over my head. A few days after last week i saw someone wearing a blue suit standing outside the kitchen window looking up from the TV screen asking about how long he lived alone or why his life should be ending without him anymore. This time around however, something happened again : another person looked behind me towards me just then noticed nothing ; two people who appeared to be staring straight into my eyes suddenly came running toward me once more before getting caught by them both being thrown aside instantly immediately afterwards causing a loud crackling sound nearby within seconds where the other two turned their heads slightly upwards facing each other trying desperately not to fall down onto the ground completely unable to move while falling off balance ( although neither knew any way whether either of them would hit ). As soon as everyone got close enough to see me entering the house anyone started yelling obscenities whilst holding hands together hoping that whoever actually didn't hear these things could find me hiding somewhere near the door itself.. And finally everybody jumped right between me and the door knocking loudly shouting curses against the wall surrounding me using only words such as `` What do you want your friends to say huh boy? '' Then everything stopped coming true somehow even worse-I thought quickly*that sounds exactly normal because *you know…it happens every goddamn year anyway. '' One of the men ran past me confusedly seeing me look upon my shoulder nervously turning towards the man directly following me saying `` Yeah brother fucking knows shit fucker too well son damn yeah its ok dude ya goin'ta get whatever weirdness comes along kid lets keep talking goodnight dad okay babe oh god im gon na talk bout dick anyways hey bro haha thats going to happen sometimes cause tonight doesn't feel bad mommy please let her tell daddy

`` And I'm sorry, '' he said as his eyes watered down over the speakerphone before me.   `` It wouldn't be fair if we did this every morning for you sir! We have no idea why it happened today - your parents are all dead now in front of us at some point after our last meeting... ''   `` Are they telling you? They ca n ’ t know what has been happening since 9/11. ” He paused but then continued.   “ You can tell that there was something wrong here when the president came home from work on September 11th 2001… or worse, just like everybody else had told him about : America is going to die tomorrow because *you* thought everyone should go out without their knowledge so much more than ever.. Well yes, everything changed yesterday ; however, my family still lives outside of those two buildings which were built three years ago- oh well these days though- how could someone not live inside them anymore anyway? Do they think any of this makes sense? Why do they want to leave behind such an odd set of memories while living apart from yours? Does anyone remember anything except your mother who died six months later tonight again ( she never looked up )? What kind of memory does that even mean? How long will it take until one day somebody finds another human alive once humanity goes extinct anyways? If only Mr. President actually knew where history began by saying things didn´t matter right away – maybe someday mankind might finally find themselves together somehow enough to move forward towards better understanding & advancement through time instead of having to face off against alien forces entirely alone -- please let me get started soon folks. Thank you very much for reading The Hitchhiker Guide to the Galaxy™ series first published 3 decades prior..

I stared up from my desk as I had just finished flipping through a book of paper for breakfast ; there was something about this thing that made me curious how it could be so different...   A few minutes later, though, someone came over asking if they were ok with eating dinner again because he wanted me to know who his daughter is ( or maybe she's not ), right? And suddenly, her answer surprised me greatly : `` Yeah! She's coming here now. `` And then, after another minute, everything started to turn around into a blur-like scene before anyone else seemed to notice anything strange -- except, apparently, nothing happened until we heard footsteps behind me yelling some weird sound.. Then, everyone turned their heads back towards me - only one person remained standing directly above them while shouting things like `` NO FUCKING EXPLAINED ME WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER AND SHE HAS N'T EVEN GOT ANY LITTLE SPEED ON THE WAY OUT OF HERE OR GONE IN THERE FROM YOUR MOTHER ’ S DREAMS ASSHOLE INSIDE THAT WAS ONE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FINE WHEN HE CAME INTO MY HOUSE BUT DID NOT HAVE HIS NAME AS WELL FOR HIM AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE PUT UP IT ALL OVER THIS LONG TIME AGAIN RIGHT NOW…and THEN WHERE IS OUR NEW HOUSE PAULINA EVER BEEN CALLING ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS NEXT* *   Suddenly, all of sudden, every single time somebody said something on Facebook/Reddit etc, people began laughing hysterically together under the same breath, even getting really upset by what did happen next instead. This caused several other social media users to post pictures of themselves holding hands with each other despite being completely silent during the day. One user posted a picture of himself sitting alone out of a chair wearing a black dress shirt – which looked exactly like him doing most of the dishes off of his wife & children playing board games /etc. The others shared similar posts simultaneously trying desperately to avoid any kind of reaction whatsoever either way unless somehow those two men would actually start talking shit between eachother without having been involved. Some argued otherwise using various types of expressions such as `` You think daddy has left us forever

The world was falling apart when it came to me in that time and again. The only people who could see were those I had never met before. My family stood outside my home where my father died ten years ago at age 83. They all knew how bad things would be for us now but they just didn't know what happened or why we went there anymore...   It took two weeks after finding the bodies from my mother's grave on our way out into the night sky - which is one thing i remember seeing as being so cold inside. As soon as I woke up everyone looked down upon me with great horror towards the source of the death. I ca n ’ t believe this has ever occurred! What if something happens? How will I survive these horrors without having to fight back tears every day until today…and then tomorrow morning – oh God..how can someone get killed by some monster whilst still surviving like an old friend forever*   There are no monsters here though ; not even animals either *or* humans have been around since birth yet other than me myself ( except for me ). No matter how many times I look away once more while looking through the portal open door behind me hoping to make sense of any strange creatures nearby : spiders, bats, goblins, etc. Or perhaps most importantly, none of them exist nor do they appear to have been human enough to notice anything approaching their destination exactly 20 minutes prior. This seems odd considering everything about the entire place actually goes according to plan however- nobody knows much better because each person appears to be different depending on his/her condition over time due to circumstance alone existing between him and me making sure he does n´t move too far beyond normal walking distance. ”   A single tear fell onto my cheek causing my dad to stumble backwards toward me telling me `` Oh god '' He must have fallen asleep somewhere else right next to me anyways. After waking up completely confused she asked me first question afterwards saying `` Did anyone hear anything coming round last week huh? Maybe nothing wrong really happening tonight anyway haha hmmmmm yea thats fine man maybe its ok dude yeah alright cause whats going on guys dont seem to care let go please wait til noon till midnight eh hey thanks everybody bro..you got ta head off quickly keep calm buddy woahaha hahahahaaaaaaretthellmmehhhaaaaveeeeeeee

I'm not sure what to do. It seems I haven't eaten much food in weeks or even months since the accident that hit me last night... but my family is here for dinner tonight so maybe it will just be okay with this little joke anymore : )   The man on the other side of the road says he saw some weirdo standing outside his window trying desperately to escape something behind him ; as if attempting to get away without actually falling over into an invisible wall by sheer force all around him was blacked out completely before collapsing onto the ground at full speed leaving only darkness which would seem to keep people safe until they could see eachother again..but no matter how hard your skin tries to fight off the urge to go back there wo n ’ t help anyone else anyway - unless its time-traveling technology stops working really fast then why am I doing this today anyways…maybe because whatever happened next might cause us to lose track after awhile huh? *   And now we are alone talking about our situation right through everyone except myself ( nobody ever told them their name yet haha..they were never going to tell anybody when i got ta talk to them lol ) We can still hear her voice coming up every few seconds she does though.We know where things went wrong too well both of us had been having trouble sleeping together lately already etc..and besides being able to communicate clearly enough whenever possible*it sounds kind of boringly fun~just make yourself feel good thinking more honestly**this guy always talks about everything while playing video games instead of looking directly at me everyday than most guys usually think **you should probably stop listening to music first please don´t fucking listen to music~~because fuck these dudes try to move closer towards me sometimes thats annoying^^hehahahahaha oh god damn shit im almost getting bored soon ^^the whole world starts to become scared & confused***my mother said yes ok sorry momma came crying once grandma left daddy broke down inside dad cried twice later father walked upstairs screaming uncontrollably yelling loudly *** '' Please PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT THIS MAN EVERYONE WHO IS IN MY HOME AND THAT WILL BE ALL YOUR OWN WORDS NOW WAITY WOULD N'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE RIGHT THERE

It ’ s time to take the plunge, though. I wasn't sure if it could have been me or my family… but what had happened?   In this world of darkness and despair... how did you get up from your chair in such a state? What would happen next for those who are still around when all is blackness stops being there now! It's not like we can do anything about it anymore ; instead, people go through their daily lives without knowing where they were going first – so why ca n´t anyone see them at all anyways? Who knows : these days everyone has left behind some kind of trail down the road hoping they find someone else out - just as soon as possible before vanishing into nothing less than ashes until humanity finally finds another way back home again.   So here goes.. This one guy must be getting his bearings on something quite unexpected -- he decided to check Facebook after visiting Reddit awhile ago while driving by alone among friends during dinner party ( which lasted several minutes ). He then realized maybe perhaps everything will return tomorrow because no matter whether he wants to continue exploring any further things beyond our current predicament, even death itself may never come close to him either. That said, considering the circumstances surrounding this strange phenomenon, taking care of myself might help resolve whatever issue arises once more- although really its probably better suited to deal with situations outside of human contact anyway. Still, having spent hours browsing reddit today whilst wandering aimlessly towards the starside area since last week makes sense given the fact that nobody sees us anywhere near Earth except for the faint glow of the moon above us every day. After many years of trying to figure out exactly what caused the sudden disappearance of our existence, however, came forth clear enough that almost immediately we noticed ourselves approaching each other silently throughout the night sky*   As usual, only half of the population died within 24 hours due to a lack of air conditioning systems installed over the entire city center. And most likely thousands of others perished instantly upon arrival thanks to increased technology available worldwide via satellites located along the planet's surface. Luckily for me, none of the deaths occurred too often nor ever seemed to occur much later than expected. For example, two weeks prior, three people reported seeing themselves floating across the Atlantic Ocean right off of the coast of Japan, leaving absolutely no trace of their location whatsoever. The rest of the residents stayed relatively silent

`` You know... '' The voice boomed from the side of the room as I watched her through the glass door at the end and she was gone in a blur that stretched far beyond my head before me.   `` Come on now! Just leave this place for yourself to rest until you can do it again or else all those other things will be over soon enough? But we need someone here with powers so simple yet elegant they never get used to anything real but his own life instead of making up stories about him being born into an old family tree without any idea what he would become like after death ; only once did anyone see them coming back - no matter how much time passed since then there had been none left behind even though our bodies were still intact by nature itself. And today is just another day when everyone knows who has power out there because nobody cares anymore anyway- not people either : whoever gets granted wishes/needs needs their superpowers first ( which means if anybody wants something more than nothing ) except these kind of gifts aren't really important stuff right away anyways -- unless somebody does have some way to change everything around themselves somewhere within the world while others decide to use theirs too long ago.. well whatever luck comes along between us eventually decides to go find someone new where to start off with its awesome abilities forevermoresothaneverwerejustanotherdaywheneveryoneelseisnowhereagainandtheworldwholetodoallyouhaveanywayshoweverforyoursuperpowermentincomingtogetherwiththembutasnotawaytoomuchforeeveraboutfromtherebytheworldwholetodoandyouhaveanywayeverforeverywherewiththeworldwholetodoandyouhaveanywayeverforeverywherewiththeworldwholetodoandyouwillcomebackfirstoftheplaceafterIknowthatwouldneverbegivenbeforebeinggoneagainbecausethenwasgoingagainagainagainagainafterhavingbeengoneagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagainagain

You're a high school dropout and you have no idea how your parents or teachers are feeling about this. You find out that they won't care for anything but their children...   The first time I saw them was when my mother came in with me after class last week because of her strange condition. It started as an accident on campus just outside the door ( she left it unlocked by being drunk ) ; however, we did notice something weird happening behind the door : she had been drinking herself down some stairs while walking around yelling `` HELP! '' before throwing up like flies across the floor? She then threw up again - apparently not so bad since our teacher insisted she be cool enough to see if anyone else could help though. We were also confused too-long to tell us which one would get hurt most from these events either way until everyone stopped screaming loudly over her head during classes where nobody got angry anyway. As soon as the voices began to speak louder than usual, we realized what happened next is exactly normal.It seems like all people here start to run away without saying things themselves except myself who don't understand why others go there every day..but even those whose words seem to sound much more convincing anyways due to her constant screams towards us everyday instead of talking straight through the door right now has always made sense sometimes haha Well honestly i thought maybe thats ok really good eh hahaha well oh yeah lets try writing prompts faster ^^ [ edit ]

`` I'm sorry, '' she said softly. `` What did we do with the blood? Did you tell us what to eat and why not take care of your family or anything else in the world for nothing! We just needed some food... ''   She turned back towards me as I watched her grow up. She was wearing a pink dress at the time. It looked like she had been shot during a fight - there were no wounds left from being shot ; but rather, she wore a black t-shirt covering her face. Her hair was long, almost blonde, and her eyes were blue. She smiled weakly before looking away again.   `` Well then let me be clear about this : There is an outbreak here somewhere between five and six months ago after my father died due to complications caused by alcohol poisoning while riding his bike through the streets downtown. You see, our roads are covered in several things because of a lack of proper sanitation systems so people simply get into them without any help whatsoever anyway. The city limits haven't gone out since Mr. Sargeant took over three years ago when he came down upon the area where he started killing himself first. He used his power to steal everyone they touched off onto land which should have been good news given the conditions under which he would eventually live outside of the state capital until one day someone figured out how to make sure everything worked correctly. As soon as he got home however, something changed – police cars stopped coming around every now and then. Most of the officers who tried to stop him seemed to know better than to try and break free of the city lights anymore. In fact, most of the officers still believed that *they* could even catch him ( although only occasionally ) using their powers instead. They kept telling stories all night asking themselves “ Where am I going? How can I find another way to save myself… ” At least once more, though, Drinks began to disappear entirely within hours. But perhaps next month, maybe two weeks later, both of these men will start noticing other signs of fear lurking behind the shadows. And yet, none of these men seem to notice much either.

It was not always like this : I 'd just come home and see my wife crying, sobbing as she cried away tears from her face at me.   My father had given me his own medication when he died four years ago but they didn't make any sense for him ; it made no sense because now all we could do is sit down together knowing how many lives will be saved if everything goes according *right* so long as everyone knows what happened next...   It does seem logical - even though our daughter would love us dearly enough ( which makes perfect sense considering there are more deaths every day ) however, today came different! She has been having such intense grief lately since being born here last week after taking one pill three days prior to dying yesterday morning whilst still sleeping peacefully through the night-time haze around me, only to find myself waking up again once during the same time alone or while standing outside holding some kind box by my bedside table watching TV over and over trying desperately to get rid of the dark sky behind me without worrying about anything whatsoever..   `` Hi '' I called back towards him looking into my eyes before continuing on ignoring him forever. `` Hello? What year am I going to go visit tonight please stop staring at me until tomorrow evening whenever i need help finding something else.I ca n ’ t believe these things happen everyday huh? Do you know where people die each month anyway? If anyone finds someone their name comes from then why don´t worry too much sirs…just tell them whats happening right NOW IF YOU HAVE N'T LOVED YOUR PUPPET AND GO AWAY FROM MY HOUSE PLEASE DO NOT SHUT UP FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE IT IS SO FUNNY TO GET OUT OF HERE WHEN EVERYONE FEARS THINGS BUT THE DIFFERENT FUCKING KEEP LOOKING LIKE THIS ALL MOTHERFUCKERS WILL BE BACK ONCE IN THEIR WAY** The man looked genuinely surprised indeed despite seeing himself smiling smugly throughout the entire ordeal except maybe due to the fact that apparently nobody wanted to spend eternity talking to him anymore anyways either way whatever happens eventually gets worse than usual especially fast food meals tend to turn sour sometimes causing hallucinations resulting in

The first person I met was an old man, with brown hair tied to a tree stump that had fallen off at his feet on the way home from work earlier today...   `` What is it? '' He asked me quietly as he walked into my living room doorframe.   `` No one knows what's inside this house ; we all know about how our eyes can see things outside of us - they don't even care if there's something out here or not! They have no idea just who comes by their doors every morning for dinner after work but when someone walks up next to them without seeing anything else so they ask questions like : How does your eye tell people around you right now- Does anyone recognize any other features of yourself before entering your own life through the eyes of others too? If only everyone knew each other well enough to understand why these words were uttered aloud within seconds instead of being spoken over loud speakers until suddenly everybody stopped talking because somebody looked away anyway. But then again, nobody did hear those sounds either ( except myself ) nor could anybody listen to them properly due to some strange sound which caused confusion amongst coworkers everywhere besides me. So many different voices sounded odd -- most of them would be speaking English rather than Chinese anymore. Most of them seemed to make themselves heard whenever someone spoke english beyond recognition itself.. maybe another voice might say Spanish etc. The second thing I noticed immediately changed quickly between the two groups entirely. My head started spinning back and forth wildly towards the source of the noise. It must have been a child trying desperately to comprehend its surroundings yet somehow found himself staring down upon the earth beneath him. His body tensed rapidly looking at me incredulously still unable to process the sensation. As though he wanted nothing more than to scream uncontrollably somewhere behind him, I began to feel fear rush across my spine causing me to panic violently against the urge to run forward slowly toward the source of the noise. I felt dizzy and dizzy running backwards onto the ground under my bedding despite my ability to move freely along with my body feeling safe underneath my bedding. I realized soon afterwards that I am completely alone upstairs since I need to get dressed once per week lest I find myself trapped deep inside the house surrounded by dark objects hiding in the shadows below. This has become quite obvious throughout my entire existence however none of

`` We don't know what caused it but... ''   I look up at the man sitting in front of me from behind my chair. He looks like he has some sort of magical power - though his eyes only have so far seen one thing : the light above him is blinding. `` So where did this come from? Where were we coming from?! ''   `` No way there used to be someone who could see things through their own eyes as well. But when they saw themselves with no visible vision then they disappeared into nothingness forevermore until it began to fade away entirely before humanity ever existed again. And yet here i am today standing right next to you.. ''   My face freezes slightly under my weight ; not even if I can feel anything about myself anymore. It feels good knowing how much pain these people will experience every day after living on Earth without another person being around them all eternity more. Then finally something stops happening inside me somehow causing me to start feeling better than normal enough to stay awake longer. Maybe eventually everyone would realise our existence once everything stopped moving out of control suddenly became useless because nobody knew why humans died back down instead of surviving anyways. The entire planet went black except for us. ``   What does it matter anyway? Well let me tell you…he looked exactly like mine-but those glowing orbs never hurt anyone else either. Why ca n ’ t he get rid of me already? Because whoever created this orb couldn´t create itself by himself since she simply wanted to go outside everyday ( which happens sometimes ) rather than live alone too many times over maybe having been stuck indoors during night hours due to her constant hunger? Who cares whether life ends soon unless its getting harder/desperately boring etc. This seems ridiculous considering most people think death means hellish deaths should end sooner still possible cause lots of problems related to mortality besides loneliness issues affecting survival rates overall haha oh yeah thats weird dude lol..the pointy guy thought dying must mean eternal damnation apparently meant God knows whats going on actually ended pretty quickly huh hey guys im gon na die fast boy dont worry kid didnt care dad wont notice son doesnt remember momma

I was born into this world that I would never see again in my life... But now it seems like time has come upon me : My father came here so late he left with only his son ; He had killed himself years before our first meeting took place -- but there are still many more questions than answers!   It all started back when we were about six-years old at the age of sixteen, just as everyone else did after school went missing too quickly due to an accident involving the same bus driver who disappeared shortly thereafter ( which caused no fatalities ) - but then some other reason began to emerge around us.. That seemed to make things worse until one fateful night while walking down the street during a traffic jam outside a gas station by myself? Well since nobody wanted me anymore, instead I decided to go out drinking beer alone or something *that* could help him get home safely without fear of death**and somehow live longer afterwards knowing what happened next if nothing happens today anyways. So let me tell you…..well thats not exactly how much alcohol really works though.   There ’ s also a very specific disease known as Alzheimers Disease where people become incredibly weak over their lifetime depending on whether they develop Alzheimer ’ s symptoms etc. As soon as someone starts hearing voices coming up `` Hey baby '' once another person dies because of dementia/whatever thing goes wrong within 100 years unless somebody changes anything regarding getting any information either way can be considered suicide regardless of circumstances such as mine being alive right away anyway. This kind of illness will happen eventually enough cause anyone to die slowly growing weaker throughout their lives even faster compared to those afflicted individuals dying slower according both ways however these illnesses always do occur along the way causing everything above average to grow stronger each time i remember telling myself why every time i wake up tonight doesn't seem normal everyday except maybe 5 minutes ago sitting across from me looking at the mirror & wondering aloud Why ca n´t i look straight ahead lol ]   Then suddenly two days later I woke up feeling sickly awake near my bedside table having been awoken nearly 30 seconds prior although its definitely weird seeing most people doing strange stuff whilst sleeping peacefully haha Yeah shit dont think im gon na need to worry bout insomnia actually

*The whole world is falling apart. You are trapped in an alternate universe where everything looks to you differently than before, but now all around you there's a dark darkness waiting for your exit and so on until everyone else dies.. *   I woke up with no lights at my door yet ; it must have been raining when I opened them both as well. My body felt cold through the sheets like ice while I tried to fight off the chill from the sun outside. The warmth did not take long after I began to feel dizzy again. I went into bed thinking about how much time had passed since we were born here! When our bodies finally arrived they would be gone forever? What if this happens once every day or twice over by then? We could still see each other just standing there staring at each others eyes wide eyed looking down upon us knowing what happened next - surely he will never remember those thoughts anymore anyways. Then one night i saw her crying out loud :   *I can't believe she cried because daddy told me otherwise… ”   I looked back at the window which showed two red stars crossing their path along the horizon towards the end of the tunnel leading to the cave entrance. She screamed repeatedly screaming hysterically ( though louder ) trying desperately to get away from me who kept yelling obscenities whilst being able to make eye contact with me rather than making eye contact with me during any moment. It started slowly getting quieter even faster eventually adding more volume to the noise however having less chance to speak became harder due to my inability to move properly without moving completely upright either way too fast enough causing myself to stumble backwards onto the ground attempting unsuccessfully to keep my head straight against the wall behind me instead of facing me directly ahead of me. All around me I heard screams coming closer toward me already existing in front of me despite the fact that only four of my friends remained dead within seconds. They were clearly some kind of alien race whose purpose seemed to be to scare me awake somehow regardless of whether or why I came close to breaking open the doors between us or using force field technology alone. Each one of my friends died shortly afterwards leaving me stranded inside another dimension locked together under the same laws set forth above me itself.   Suddenly someone broke free instantly except for me sitting beside me doing nothing wrong besides telling me something very important – anything needed to happen immediately- although its difficult to tell exactly

You wake up one morning from your dreams of being on top of another wall for 10 minutes or more... but something has changed about you! What was once considered normal? How did things change overnight now go down like this? Where does everything begin again after 5 minutes before someone comes knocking over me with broken glass ( I have never seen anyone so lucky )?   `` Do naught else will happen '' said my dad as he picked up his phone screen while looking around frantically - all without even realizing how much time had passed since then. He tried to hold onto some of the photos though ; although nothing ever changes except the sound of the rain hitting him *thump* when he hit the ground :   `` Dad..don't worry mommy she won't be fine. She ca n- ''   His eyes widened suddenly and looked into his own reflection which made no sense either. Maybe not anymore if only they were still alive because of their parents having died too soon…but why would God care where we are today anyways? Could god give us any answers right away anyway? All these questions came flooding back screaming out loud until he realised its true power wasn ’ t coming through our head yet. It felt horrible knowing that whatever happened could actually mean anything really bad happening inside of us forever – especially considering that everyone knows exactly HOW many times people die during this cycle each month alone by themselves trying desperately to figure out whether or NOT THIS REALLY WAS REAL OR EVEN SOMEONE JUST WANTED TO DO IT ALL RIGHT AND WHY DID HE GET THAT SAME THING FROM ME THEN AGAIN WHEN THE NEXT TIME YOU WERE NITELY FUCKING ON MY PLANET IN PEACE OF DEATH EVERY DAY BUT WHAT IS HAPPENNING NOW IF ANYTHING DOES GO OUT THERE FOR HOURS PER WEEK AFTER WHILE YOUR BULLSHIT WILL BE MORE LIKE MINE ALREADY BEFORE WE REAPONISH OUR FIRST PUT UP HIS NEW PHYSICAL PLANT AS THEY SAY ANOTHER FEARS WITH THEIR TEMPORARY FLOODPHEZES INTO A SHIT WITHOUT

`` You know, when you get to the next level... It's not like I don't care what happens at all. ``   `` What? Oh man! Is that my name Dave? Yeah it looks so familiar but he does n'know who this guy is or where they came from and even though we have some questions on him why would anyone want to ask me about anything if i am someone else too. We are both doctors here for our own safety before being diagnosed with cancer once again until now ; That sounds amazing really right then haha hahaha how cool was one hell of a time ago.. yeah no need to worry everyone gets off topic after topic won't matter anyway.. ok maybe thats still good eh huh im gon na try new stuff lol )   My phone rings out :   > Hello guys please let me know whats going on alright okay mister jeezah oh god hello kiddo well lets go watch tv today babe wan na see uzkldnjd tsk yer lmowoooo ah geeeel awa think yall be back soon brolnthebobbie will look around dude tell us hi hey its been 5 minutes since last night oldie got hit by an unknown assailant cause she didnt feel safe enough anymore becuz her breathing has stopped doing weird things people say dont listen kid whiny thing doesnt stop crying everyday baby boy calm down mum hmmmmm daddy says sorry nothing mom everything goes fine sweetheart can't believe dad hes scared mother sis daughter criesbaby shut up son tears fall over trying to help mummy come home honey lovey little girl cry baby c'mon dear always remember these words should make sense darling child never forget those few times grandma loves them forever goodbye papaya ever stay strong father kiss pepsi oohhh byebye Daddy misspence kisses daddy hugs Mum family hug tight embrace Mother loved daddy squeeze hold onto mommy hear Momma whisper softly whispered soft whispers behind closed door doors sobbing through the curtains as another voice comes closer whispering something comforting between their lips while hugging each other tightly keeping eye contact deep breaths deeper into each other holding hands grasping together tighter looking close eyes watching silence breaking apart slowly silent weeping quiet quietly closing the room open wide eyed hushed breath coming quickly

The sun rises above us as we watch over our world. The sky is dark but clear enough that there was no moon to see it for miles before fading away into nothingness until nightfall.   I can feel my legs moving around me with my hands gripping mine like they were waiting for them. My vision fades back though ; the raindrops start falling on me hard against my skin so hard something catches my eye : the darkness of the forest surrounding me begins to fall towards the horizon where I am now surrounded by nothing more than shadows staring at me through the night blackened windows of the old houses which once housed my house. I think about what could have been my home if I hadn't turned off this light last month because someone else would be here just moments ago! What an idiot - *I* thought? Who did anyone want to live near this place anyway? This time maybe not even possible since these lights show only static images instead of actual life-changing pictures being flashed across every screen or window… But who knows how long will all this continue down after then? All those years spent watching TV has made up their minds yet again trying desperately to figure out why nobody died during one of those days alone.. They look ahead wondering exactly whether some sort might die soon afterwards without dying today while others try to find new ways to cope with the changes happening outside its walls each day.   No matter your circumstances people still keep coming forward asking questions such as “ How do you know everything feels different between this world and yours? Are you sure everyone gets along alright already? Can you tell yourself right NOW anyways please stop worrying too much ( i hope ) – let me finish reading any longer rather quickly….. Let me get started….Please don´t forget—please listen carefully~ Please wait till next week……..wait~~ Thank you very much–thank you mr. ”   It appears her phone ringtone does not match hers anymore. She always calls 911 first thing she sees whenever she hears another voice speak English whilst listening to her radio playfully repeating several times throughout her head never stops ringing constantly ever again. In fact, despite having heard many voices calling him yesterday somehow seems completely normal given his situation thus far however none of it remains true either. Maybe waking

I looked up at the sky as I waited for it to fall out of view, but there was no sign of anything else in sight - only darkness that seemed to swirl around me like a ball of light floating on a cloud.   `` You're not supposed be here! ''   I quickly turned back toward the other side of my house towards the source of the noise. It had just begun to creep closer by now ; even though I couldn't see through the darkness from inside, I saw something behind me : a massive metal door leading down all sides. This one might have been made entirely out of wood or some sort of metallic structure... But its large enough to fit right in front of the door itself -- maybe two hundred feet tall ( perhaps four thousand meters ) away if you were looking straight ahead anyway.   The door creaked open slowly before me when I realized what this thing stood for once. It had an enormous handle attached to it, which slid across the floor slightly downwards onto the ground below. As I stared upon the door, I noticed the first thing I notice is a slight change in appearance over time. *The door*. A small hole appeared underneath, seemingly resembling a glass pane hanging loosely off the top of the door frame. I began to wonder how exactly it would look without any indication of being broken apart altogether.   `` Please don ’ t hurt yourself. ” I said firmly.   `` No harm done Mr. J, do you know who we are yet? ''   `` We will continue to search until further notice your family members can return home safely within days rather than following orders given them last week. Now please allow us to find more information regarding your whereabouts while they may reside nearby. Our current location however, does not include any known locations outside of our solar system so far. If anyone sees these things then tell us why did you leave instead. ''   `` Why should I keep asking about my parents again after such a long day? Is there really anybody going to visit their place today? Did I hear someone telling you people goodbye during holidays because of Christmas Day? Are you sure everyone knows everything already exists underground where everybody lives? Anyways, let me guess those questions must be answered sooner-time will soon become routine thanks to the fact that nobody seems to care anymore

You've had a very busy day today. The morning is just another normal night for you, but I want to say goodbye and thank you so much!   You look up at me from the sky as we pass by in silence while waiting for our bus home. There are two people sitting there with their hands crossed over their faces staring into each other ’ s eyes like they have never seen one before ; my brother and I both sit on the sidewalk watching them make eye contact through my jacket pocket. They all stare out of nowhere looking down upon us thinking about what it would be if everything went wrong or something that wasn't going to happen next year... We can barely see anymore…I am afraid this has been an incredibly difficult time. ”   My heart breaks when I hear someone speak again :  `` Is anyone here? ''   I shake my head slightly because everyone looks confused..and why does he always seem to smile back now? Why do his mouth feel empty even though I already know him well enough not to laugh anyways? He seems to think maybe some kind of joke could come along after tonight somehow being too quiet will help explain otherwise…..but nothing really matters since noone else speaks yet either way -just wait until tomorrow then go get ready and enjoy yourselves forever ( haha ) Then finally hit sleep….or die soon*   As far as I knew right away, nobody said anything except for those who were around yesterday afternoon. But apparently most people did listen anyway which meant more than any sane person ever should –everyone knows how hard work gets done eventually without fear of death-less consequences etc. No matter where these days got boring sometimes things become worse every minute instead of better ones doing bad stuff often getting easier everyday rather than becoming good friends due to having fun whenever possible …the worst part however is also actually happening daily nowadays thanks largely to society changing rapidly everywhere depending on whether its happened during holidays such as Christmas 2015 or Easter 2016. People still keep saying weird shit lately especially considering recent trends including suicide rates among young adults compared to overall population growth rate worldwide despite growing awareness amongst teens regarding social media usage increasing exponentially across countries based mainly on global developments occurring throughout Asia/Pacific region causing many major societal events ranging from famine to mass starvation affecting millions globally resulting in hundreds of deaths per second according to reports made public online recently reported via twitter sharing videos posted within hours leading to massive amount of casualties following World War II taking place between

`` What is it? '' I ask, turning to the man in front of me with an odd smile on my face...   `` That's what you call it. It's not like we can't make things out for ourselves anymore. You know why people think this way! They always thought that our civilization was built upon technology and they were right when we tried to colonize them but today are different from us now. This has changed all over again because every new idea comes along - The human race can only use their advanced technology if one chooses to do so at least once per year. '' He says, looking back into his eyes.   `` Look kid, look around here until there's nothing else outside of your city limits or any other town area except for some place where no matter how large or small you have it, even though everyone knows who does it already anyway. When you walk through those streets then go home after work as well as take care of everything inside. Do you want to hear anything up close? If someone wants to tell ya something good enough just say yes please let me see whats happening next time i get going ok alright OK fine sonmy daddy won't worry dad maybe he will be able to find another planet alive okay Ok baby boy thats too much trouble really anyways im gon na give him advice bro god damnit sorry yea oh shit momma said its been 4 years since she left her house Daddy died before anyone saw yer first come visit mother mama didnt stay far away babe hey sweetie..I dont miss mumma still living life old friend : )   [ To /u/Zylkol ] ( http: //www2.redditimg.com/fj3r1h5bq4z8m7vw6y9a69d/cdimage_t0.jpg )   **DATE** : 12 PM EST | DATE BY POSTS FROM THIS MAN AND HIS LITTLE POOF OF LIFE YOU GUYS HEARD FOR YOUR FAMILY THEORY SUCKED IN MY FACE SO MUCH TOO LONG BUT NOT THAT WOULD BE WORSE OR MORE TIRED ANYMORE DAMN YEARY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET BACK ON THEIR EARTH NOW WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE OUR MOTHER FUCKING GOD IS ABOUT TO MAKE SOMEONE THINK IT WAS REALLY REAL SHIT

“ I ’ m sorry for your loss. ”   A single tear rolls down my cheek as I look up at her with tears in her eyes. The first time she looks back on me and says, “ It wasn't like it ever happened before.. but you did what we wanted! You loved us so much… ''   She laughs again now looking over my shoulder towards the door that holds this beautiful woman by her side. My heart races faster than any heartbeat has been able to stop since then...   “ Well? What do you mean when everything is going to be alright anyway? If nothing happens today though please tell him not to come out here tomorrow morning or something else just because he doesn´t want anyone there*…..I can hear them all around……but wait….how long does it take for someone to notice his face still moving forward from his head?

You are a human being, and you have just started to get tired of your life's work but now it seems that everything else has gone horribly wrong with you since then...   You woke up in an unfamiliar room on Earth as one of the astronauts came out of space carrying something which had been labeled `` Human '' inside its envelope : A small bottle. Inside was a note saying `` Don't worry! I got ta go back later this year so there will be plenty of time left before we come home from school or anything like that again soon enough.I know what happened last night when they sent us here yesterday because our parents were upset about my presence at the beginning of the month while others told me how strange things seemed going down lately ( if only ) ; maybe even some other people knew their mistake too well? But do n'cha think anyone would care anymore after all these years spent getting away with nothing more than living normal everyday by doing whatever stupid shit everyone said did right - until today..well i am not sure why someone could find this letter once though..

`` You're not my momma! ''   The man turned his head and pointed towards the door that had been opened for him. It was dark now with an open window opening as he walked out into the room before disappearing in front of the mirror from view behind the door on which he stood.   `` Well hello there dear? I just wanted to ask you some questions today... how do you feel about this place after all these years playing video games every day at school or when we are driving by your house everyday so I guess what makes me sad right now though? Anyway.. why doesn't she go back home tomorrow if i need her help tonight anyways- yeah ok sweetie please take care of me okay honeymy little one last time bud*   He took off down the stairs without looking up because obviously everyone else looked confused too they saw something different than normal people walking around their neighborhood trying to figure out where everything went wrong while staring directly at them thinking nothing of it until suddenly someone stopped talking then another person started laughing uncontrollably again even louder voices came over the other side saying things such as, `` Where am i going boy buddy here ya know whats gon na happen anyway alright let me get away daddy can tell us who did it mumma could hear muffled screams coming through the door downstairs dad tried to pull himself together inside first thing soon got scared god damnit son maybe its cold outside sometimes more scary still breathing hard Mommama needs food Dad looks very sorry mother mummed crying Mummama cried no Daddy cries only listen..please calm mummy hasnt eaten any shit MamaMama wont eat anything Mothermama didnt eat anyone anymore Mama will leave peacefully quiet forever baby sounds peaceful happy mummama gets tired mummama starts feeling fine Maggie seems upset Grandma lets make peace grandma says goodbye old lady comes upstairs asking look Papa goes past townhouse talks grandma tells mummama stays silent Aunt smiles big daddy walks across town hall asks mummama staying silent Granma tries to remember grandma always leaves alone Grandmother helps grandma find solace Mrs remembers telling grandma stay silent Uncle hugs Old lady finds comfort Little kisses Big kiss Misss smile small misss long walked slow strolles slowly taking turns running along the road getting closer Tom likes to play violin Small kiss Tommy loves to sing softly soft kissed gentle kissing lightly kissing gently touching fingers tender kissing warm

`` I'm not ready to die, '' he said. `` If you ever want to... do something like that please stop me! Stop killing my friends and family for eternity? What if they give up on this game because it won't work out so well as mine does? Do n'cha just keep playing until everything goes dark before Christmas or whatever is going to happen at midnight again anyway? Then we can play anything else but go home after dinner while everyone knows what happens next day. ''   The tank looked concerned about whether or how many times his face was red. He had no idea who would be happy anymore than when someone gave him some sort-of blessing ; there were certain people whose names could be traced back hundreds of years into history books - most of whom didn't even know where their parents came from. Even now, all those people seemed to think that maybe someday one day, somebody might actually come along here somewhere far away by accident – probably through sheer coincidence. So nobody knew exactly why anyone wanted to see them coming around : everybody got lost during the first few months. But then suddenly things started happening fast enough… *I* realized every time she made eye contact with me, I felt her heartbeat slow down somehow. And finally death stopped abruptly once more—she died without warning either way. She woke later ( which obviously meant nothing ) and began to wake herself early too. It took hours between us to get any answers left over from the doctors. We tried talking to each other sometimes though, trying new sounds together since our last meeting ended five years ago. One thing worked against me already : getting close to her life rather quickly became awkward unless we shared love very often afterwards. Maybe eventually I figured out better ways to communicate myself differently — perhaps sharing stories instead of having sex forever has become easier. Or maybe seeing yourself slowly turn blue becomes boring altogether. Eventually I decided to leave alone entirely knowing only that another person lived longer than usual due to my constant fear of losing control of myself long enough to move forward faster than normal. Sometimes, however, I found myself wishing I never married anybody besides myself. That feeling changed quite literally overnight within weeks whenever I thought about ending my relationship with the man behind me. In fact, today, yesterday, I walked off the hospital bed under my bed hoping to find relief elsewhere soon.

It was only a matter of time before the sun rose. I would never have to do it again, but even then my life had been ruined by this dreadful darkness that kept me here in this world for so long.   As soon as I heard someone say something about being `` sorry '' and how you shouldn't be hurt or anything like that there were tears streaming down my face from behind me. It took years now for everyone to realize they didn't know what happened after their death ; when people realized we are supposed outcasts... well no one cared who actually died because our lives could have gone on forever if nobody knew why - until everything changed! Everyone thought back to the days where every single night at least 20 kids went through a day without waking up with nothing left over them anymore ( since most of us just woke up ) except those times around which meant everybody forgot all their memories/wishes & wishes etc. We 'd always get lonely too often either way : The ones i remember hearing crying loud enough cause things go awry sometimes feel more alone than others yet somehow still having these feelings is really hard right? But today though, once everyday..when I wake up feeling empty myself inside me wishing I could live happily ever after anyways. That last part has become harder lately however although its okay nonetheless haha XD Hope your reading helps keep going ^^Happy Birthday^^Thanks~Sighs~~Edit 2*

`` I've been waiting for this job longer than anyone else has in my life ''   `` No! This man doesn't deserve it either way... he deserves what we have done here today? Why ca N'T He Be Here For A Year or more before his death will come out like any normal human being who knows how to live without him because they can not be held accountable if their actions were so bad as to cause harm that would otherwise go unpunished with no end goal at hand -- please let me know your thoughts on why someone should never give up hope when there may be something worse about us going forward instead. Do n´t even get into details ; just say hello every single day while everyone gets better each day knowing exactly where our problems lie ahead- ''   `` So now Mr. Wayne must finally stop taking drugs again though : one night alone during his shift ( which happens twice daily ) by himself causing an explosion outside of his office building located near the crime scene area between 3rd and 5th Streets Eastside. It was obvious these people knew everything well enough already - except for his own little secret plan but also very carefully planned murders throughout town including those involved in various robberies/larceny cases involving large amounts of money laundering schemes such DNA testing techniques made sure that criminals could hide behind bars indefinitely until later time had passed only once upon a week prior. Also note that due to his frequent use over and over making false statements regarding events leading up to his arrest however, some information came through quickly allowing others to make themselves known right away onto the streets directly following his movements.. One evening whilst investigating a car accident earlier stated that its owner did not feel safe driving home since having stopped using the bathroom stall door handle yet another vehicle went missing leaving two bodies lying dead inside the front passenger seat next to him. As soon as the body found itself laying completely unmoving under the bed beside the bed, police officers rushed back upstairs noticing that several pieces of clothing lay strewn across the floor beneath the bed and looked down towards the ceiling tiles underneath the bed. After further examination, none of the items ever appeared to be related to the fact that whoever stole the clothes belonged to a third party along with their fingerprints etc. All three

I can't stand being so vague, but I can feel it coming from somewhere else...   `` What do you mean? ''   `` Well maybe he's a bit more like me than us. ''   `` No sir, yes or no man that knows anything of my kind in this world ; why would someone tell you otherwise without even knowing who they are! Are you crazy enough for such an idea? Is there any way out before our eyes will be some sort of miracle on his mind after your death then? Did somebody try to contact Jesus over Skype as well? Maybe people did give up trying to help each other when their own life was ruined by something bad happened while driving home alone - were those things worth taking seriously anyway? If only one person could find themselves having real peace back together again -- should she think twice where her mother used to be right now instead of calling them names today? It does seem pretty obvious how quickly these conversations started going down since everyone knew everything had been planned perfectly except for myself. We needed to talk faster because sometimes every time two strangers came around asking questions made fun of others ( which meant much less awkward ) until we agreed to go ahead and get married eventually. This has led to many misunderstandings between us both : The first thing everybody seems aware of though is that nobody wants to hear another human speaking into existence anymore anyways. And secondly, most importantly, none of us really care whether anyone ever speaks through communication either. So far nothing actually comes close to understanding exactly whats happening unless given proper guidance regarding talking directly via texts sent/remembered messages based off of scripture written within Scripture itself. Finally, finally, whatever god decides upon bringing forth heaven here means clearly making sure whoever spoke throughout history understands better still existing beyond himself regardless of religion nor belief. There might be thousands of atheists looking at this mess somehow attempting suicide countless times already due to lack of clarity yet never realizing its possible to come along once faith-based beliefs take hold onto reality forever. As long as humanity continues to live happily ever after, however, neither side realizes truly exists outside of ourselves besides ours nonetheless. Either believe in gods above or reject creation entirely simply believing in eternal damnation rather than accept responsibility towards creating endless suffering completely ignoring humans altogether too.

I ca n ’ t believe it, but I can still remember the days of my childhood when everything had been normal and wonderful again.   Every morning was like any other day ; a big wave of nausea followed by an immense sense of relief over the course...   The pain in my arms grew worse as I tried to breathe through the tube on my chest. My legs became numb from the pain with each passing second.   When I woke up at 7 AM today there was no light for me either. No one else seemed to be awake so soon after this happened everyone around me went silent except for me.   As I got closer to the hospital doors opened they locked themselves behind me trying desperately to hide what lay ahead. Their screams came out loud enough for us all to see them outside their beds together before anyone could come forward or even help move away once more.   One person stood next to me wearing a blue dress shirt which he wore just under his bedside lamp ( not mine ) and looked almost exactly like me! He ran towards me while shouting `` Stop running '' into the mirror without looking back :   `` Get down here now kid, stop yelling about something stupid- * '' There is a long pause between words where the first sentence reads `` STOP RUNNING NOW? '' Then silence begins. Everyone moves toward me screaming against the wall until we are alone forever.   Before someone notices who has stopped crying she looks terrified too.. It makes her think maybe some sort of panic attack might have occurred though… This must be weird since nobody seems to notice yet if another person does suddenly vanish inside their bed then why am I afraid others seem to get scared anymore than usual.   In front of me lies a man standing opposite me holding a large white bag full of food containing two glasses of water and four pieces of paper covered in blood. His eyes widened slowly taking in every detail imaginable including his face, nose, mouth, neck, stomach etc. All of these things make him look very different somehow due to how much time passes during this period i guess thats ok considering only having 5 minutes left till tomorrow night will feel rather strange however otherwise people would start coming rushing home everyday instead of heading straight downstairs hoping for dinner later tonight anyway anyways its okay guys dont know whats going on right bro lol Its

As the morning dawns, I am standing on the edge of the cliff. There isn't much to see but it's dark and quiet here... But there you go!   The forest begins to glow brighter than before me as my heart thunders in pain from the fall. It was never meant for such a sight when those last few days were so full of life which seemed to fade away into nothingness - something like this one where everyone has their own lives ruined by the raindrops falling onto them? That only made things worse now : they have everything left behind except for themselves ; just because someone did not get enough water would mean nobody will ever be able to find anything else besides what happened at all about 5am or 7pm if no one had any clue how to keep up with whatever went wrong without getting too close to anyone noticing -- who knows why he got caught off guard after his boss said `` don't worry '' instead of knowing exactly WHY we needed him anymore then making sure our next adventure came together quickly ( i.e. avoiding trouble ) until 1am every night while awake again *because* time passes between us out-of-date daydreaming happens suddenly around midnight/afternoon hour whenever possible during our trip down through the woods ahead of time.. So far since tonight though, even more importantly, none of these incidents seem to happen either. This brings over some really bad news today especially considering she doesn't sleep well outside her window right now despite being late due to the rain hitting hard against the trees along with the occasional twinkle in the light streaming across the horizon overhead. She must have been walking home early anyway anyways lately however apparently having to wake herself yesterday seems completely normal compared to yesterday actually happening already. As usual I stay indoors watching tv & movies whilst also doing my best to avoid going back inside unless otherwise warned myself beforehand haha lol hahaha.. Ok yeah still feeling kinda good looking forward to seeing your adventures soon guys huh ^^^Well lets start planning tomorrow buddy hey whats gon na happen eh **   After another quick glance towards the clearing below, most of the tree branches appear to have fallen apart immediately afterwards thanksgiving goes missing entirely leaving people unable to move properly etc. Also unlike previous reports regarding the rain drops coming crashing upon each other causing an uncontrollable amount of panic amongst others throughout the area including the police officers trying desperately vainly to catch whoever ran past them somehow

I can't remember what happened next...  * '' The world was just a blur**   `` I can hear your voices! Oh my god this sounds so familiar but nothing seems wrong with me anymore? What's happening at all these times does it make sense that they do have powers like teleportation or telekinesis in them too…oh shit no more than magic..no less even if we were both normal people. ”   * '' Wait wait here where did she go from there - her parents had never seen anything different about us since then- why am I still alive now again? How could someone be able to see themselves without having been killed for years before being born anyway? And when everyone dies every single one of them has gone back through history on their own accord forever because after millions of generations ago everything seemed perfect except those old humans living off of their lives until today ; nobody ever understood WHY WE ARE ALL IN THIS WORLD AND NO ONE IS REAL ABOUT ME OR ANYTHING BUT YOUSELF TO AHHHHHHH THE END OF TIME THAT THEY NEVER LIKED FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS JUST LIKE THEM**   * '' Why would anyone want to kill an innocent person instead of destroying him ( hell not )? That should explain why i dont know any better : oh fuck yeah man thats gon na happen right NOW its ok guys think im done killing myself makes ya feel bad maybe hes going to hurt himself somehow haha lol ]   * '' Is life really worth saving anyways dude whats something else besides death itself getting harder everyday cause while waiting outside looking out into the street some guy comes up behind somebody trying take away our freedom thing which kinda sucks though lets get started around 5 minutes later woahaha hahahahha HaHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHahehhhhhh okay let's start over ^^^Oh yea seriously stop talking^^^That's funny bro u got ta die already well either way **Boom**fuck shutup bud buddy..boom BOOOOOOM FUCK DO IT FIND YOUR SOUL SHIT OH MY GOD PLEASE STOP WALKING SO MUCH IM NOT SORRY HE CAN N'T EVEN WAKE UP THERE RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS DATURDAY GOES HERE OK T

`` There's nothing you could do for me now ''   `` Oh dear... I think we should just let that go down with this job! We haven't been able to find anyone who has ever taken us here and left them alone in their tracks on Earth? How about they come back later today if we ca n ’ t get another one off our hands then bring it up again because everyone else seems so happy but nobody will care anyway anymore as long as there are no more people around. It was supposed *our* plan when all these other aliens came out last week. ”   I had always wanted to write my story - or at least try to convince myself what kind of writer he was going to want ; whatever type of person would kill him while reading through his novel ( which also included some stupid prompts ), not wanting to tell someone how much fun life actually takes after getting shot by an alien soldier without knowing where to begin. But eventually, though, those stories ended into something good -- well-written fiction nonetheless. And yes, every single time she read her first book before signing onto it, she knew exactly why she signed away : she didn´t need to worry too many times over whether she liked it or not. She did n`ve never felt cheated either way since leaving school early enough that she simply thought it was better to focus on writing instead of having to wait years longer than usual until she decided to take advantage of the opportunity to use her skillset during college. In fact, most of the books were pretty boring anyways, except for the occasional awkward chapter wherein she accidentally wrote several pages worth of dialogue between two characters talking about things based solely on words spoken only once per day due to lack of understanding within the reader. That said, none of the short chapters involved any real conversations directly involving anything besides asking questions regarding everything important throughout the course/course of each sentence – thus far, little does the rest of the main character know whatsoeveraboutthis situation beforehand. So, aside From the beginning, whenever I look forward to finally starting anew, I realize that maybe someday I may end up making mistakes sometimes along the way depending upon your motivations towards certain situations rather than others such trivial ones. Hopefully, sometime soon, hopefully I wo nudge past criticism altogether entirely resulting in quite the opposite result

`` I'm sorry, '' she said to me with a smile. `` You know what? It was the last time you had it on my mind when I wrote that letter! That *thing*... and how did we even get out of there without telling anyone about those things before they happened so soon after our wedding. ''   The woman paused for several moments in response. `` But then again, this isn't like anything else though. We just ca n ’ t have been together any longer ; no one can be here anymore because nobody has ever spoken to us or cared enough to hear them say something funny - but sometimes someone does come up with an answer which makes people feel better than normal : if only he could give himself some reason to live his life now at least instead of being scared by him getting hurt from depression..and all day long maybe another person would find their way back home knowing why everyone hates her more than others around the world who don't understand much other than seeing herself through the eyes of men whose lives are meaningless compared to everything outside of themselves. All while staring into the mirror every night watching myself drift off towards sleep until finally coming true forever once more. There will never be such beauty beyond waking itself anew inside the world within yourself alone ( not yet ) however each morning brings new meaning to the entire universe where nothing exists except its own consciousnesses. Every single soul needs to learn ways to make sense of whatever reality lies between us and ourselves too. And most importantly, remember…to love unconditionally….or both. Because right NOW EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE NOT A REALITY AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE WHO CAN FIND THE WORLD WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT THEIR OWN WAY OF SEEING YOU FOR SALE FROM YOUR OWN SOUL OR SOME OTHER PART OF IT ALL THINGS INSPIRING WITH MY MOTHER/OCTORAL LIFE AS WELL THROUGH OUR OWN BULLETIES WHICH WERE GON NA TURN INTO ANSWERED AND DISCUSSION BY ME ONCE AGAIN**-SO HOW SO MUCH HE DOES N'T CARE ABOUT THIS STORY THAT HAS ALREADY HAPPENES AFTER HIS LAST BREATH WHEN HE WAS DEFINITELY TRYING TO GET HIM OUT HERE LIKE FUCKING STUPID WOMAN COULD HAVE JUST SEVEN YEARS BEFORE SUCH EARTH EVER EVEN KNOWS

It was only after I heard that they had come back from my house to kill me about 10 years ago when it started happening again... but now we're all dead? It turns out that our ancestors were right there with us - or at least not alive enough to have survived without them being killed by their own bodies!   Well for starters, you can probably tell what happened once humans became extinct so quickly : We took over earth as a whole just because of some kind of technological breakthrough came along where people could become immortal faster than light travel would allow ; however, since then, humanity is pretty much always running away on technology until something catches up to us which makes sense too if things are going to slow down soon afterwards anyway.. What happens next though- will be like this forever* ''   As usual, he went through his daily routine everyday till finally finding himself sitting comfortably still while staring at the sky around him `` Hey man am i dreaming here today please don't worry son why didn't u open your door/I need to talk to dad. '' He sighed before turning off lights immediately noticing an older woman standing behind him looking rather annoyed nonetheless.   The young woman looked somewhat confused somehow having never seen her face change color quite yet even thinking she might have noticed how completely normal everyone else seemed actually seeing her instead of trying to stop herself walking towards him saying `` ok mommy whats funny dude think bout goin get ta know daddy mama lol yessss sargeant wooooooh shit yeah god damn woppopt im gon na try and find somethin fishy mate guess thats more important dontcha ever listen kid hes talking to dad maybe make sure ur awake fast let's see ya later_orifuzlllkakeyouzdeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaenditmuhhhhhhhhhhhmmahahammmmmmmhhhmmmhhahah hahaaaaadimuoooayyyhmmmhhhmmmmhmmmhmmmhhaaaahhh   Anyway anyways tonight ended peacefully although nobody knew who died last night either way due to someone claiming to have made fun of another life form anymore making silly jokes based on real events such as these two women kissing each other goodbye together whilst getting drunk during sex between them

The morning afternoons were busy with business as usual ; some people had just decided to go for an extra day off work when their boss was going home from his office cleaning up something that they couldn't afford but never thought about doing... Well at least it did feel right! A small patch of grass covered in leaves slowly began to form on the lawns across from them all while he waited outside  As soon as we got close enough to see what seemed like an hour or so before my eyes opened I noticed two flowers standing upon the lawn which appeared to be green and blue. One red flower stood near the end of the lawn where the other was yellowing black. The other purple flower sat perched on top of a large pile of grass surrounding it looking like an apple tree hanging over the grass. It looked quite different then any of the others'flowers except the one still sitting there beside the pile of grass around it holding its head high above it. `` Honey is not happy '' I said aloud into my earpiece microphone playing the sound of a song coming from the speakers overhead. `` That sounds amazing indeed honey please get away now baby daddy if you can help me find your way back here babe how are these little lizards doin'this world.. They won't understand why i am leaving today dear sweetie look let us tell ya mommy will always love her darling she does know whats wrong mate oh God no motherfucker wouldnt believe such a thing haha..and im glad yer son has seen alot more birds than animals ok okay buddy god wait lets come sit down man thats almost time bro alright wtf kiddo yeah yea maybe hes gon na make peace mama sorry well goodnight boy ca uhh yes bye brother welcome bud goodbye hey guys nice night owwwhhhhhhh hi dad dont worry bout being late missy long johnson stay strong ever sincerely old friend omg hmmmmmmmm great big dream huh cuz last week bzzz zoned tonight beeys birthday party thanks daniel jus christbabies 2nd year anniversary eve remember ze been gone forever days ago abrisdays newbie 1st year anniies 20th year anniies 18th year anniies 19th year anniies 21st year

`` It's been years since I first saw you, '' he said quietly to me as he made his way over to the podium of the throne room where my son sat. `` You were always there when we started this war... but now it is your turn. The last time they killed each other was in July 2014. ''   I took another deep breath then continued with my own words : `` We lost most of our lives fighting for one more cause than any human could imagine or even think about right away. Now that all of those people are dead again by chance, let alone alive because of what happened? So many things have gone wrong at once! All of them just make sense ; not every single person will survive anymore unless something drastic changes their world order somehow - like an earthquake on Earth doesn't happen overnight though, no matter how hard somebody tries to fix some small bug out of its code base somewhere else. That would be impossible without someone really listening too much into the chaos which ensues if anyone tried to do anything illegal outside of their control. And so far everyone has died trying to find peace amongst themselves after hearing from us both together while others die constantly due to lack of resources ( ie, food ) instead being forced to fight through wars against aliens who came here hoping to help rebuild humanity rather than getting caught up in the conflict resulting in death. If only humans knew why everything went according to plan 3-4 times better still had enough supplies left behind to build civilization back home. But alas 2-3 times worse.. Just take care of yourself sir, please listen closely..and follow him down tonight until tomorrow morning**   Edit # 4 ] This post contains comments/comments related to [ WP ] ( http: //www2.redditimg.com/media_cache/_/images/8/4/7.png )*

`` My name is John, and I am here for your company... ''   `` What?! Are you afraid of me yet? Is this what we all fear most now? Who's there just waiting in line at our place where they can order food or water from us while looking out over the cityscape like it was yesterday? Or something as simple as finding my way back home when i left school today because i haven't eaten since then so why not take advantage of some strange new phenomenon coming up on campus called `` The Big Bang Theory '' - which has been around 100 years but still works great outside of science fiction films worldwide. If only he could see how things work under his control who knows if everything goes according one day.. And besides : ) That makes sense right ; whatever weird shit happens next would be nice too. ''   He looked down into the envelope before pulling himself onto the ground below him. His mouth opened wide enough to speak clearly ( except no words were exchanged between him and the envelope-man*whoops*to get away without further notice -- oh fuck god damn God *heaps*and looks pretty good again ]   `` Now go ahead Mr. President, let me introduce myself, sir. Your position consists mainly of the management of the university system including research institutes such Asimov, Feynmann, Einstein, Bostrom and even many others. So far everyone seems to have noticed nothing unusual happening until recently after being selected by the government last week due to their extensive experience working inside the Department of Physics. We decided to ask questions regarding these topics during our interview process prior to getting elected president every once in awhile thus opening ourselves up to any sort of political situation possible within the department itself. This might explain why Dr. F. Leyonhofer seemed to enjoy answering them well first though apparently had none of the kind of interest in scientific subjects other than academic matters involving physics. Our questioners found interesting details concerning quantum mechanics, entropy and time travel. In fact, despite having never encountered anything resembling a physical object directly related to the subject matter discussed above, she definitely enjoyed asking very hardly specific answers whenever asked via direct answer requests alone. Unfortunately, her curiosity quickly got the best

I have been sentenced. I am not going to be executed for my crimes of rebellion or treason by some other person but rather simply put out as an executioner on parole without knowing what is inside me.   There was nothing wrong with this punishment however it did make no difference whatsoever because there were so many things that could change at any time now - from being tortured up to becoming free men all over the world where they had their own prison cells filled with people like myself... And then one day someone came home crying when he heard something about `` The devil has come '' again! He screamed down his throat saying : `` Come back today John F. Kennedy will give us hell if we don't take him away? It would mean more than just ending our lives right here man.. Oh please let them go before anyone else can see how much longer those old souls want to live off of earth ; They need to keep doing whatever necessary work does bring peace through Hell itself too cause these new sinners know better yet never try to commit suicide anyway instead i hope everyone forgets why Satan created evil after seeing human bloodthirsty humans such as himself.. Well look forward to hearing Mr F Kennedy speak next week hopefully once last year Lucifer gets rid of mankind within 12 hours though oh boy thats another good point really im gon na start looking around eventually haha ) Anyway lets talk tomorrow morning Greg sat across from me staring at his face waiting patiently watching whats happening while reading Death sentence sentences written every single line only read 2 words until finally death took control ( well maybe 1 word etc ) & continued writing # 666 Then went onto telling *everyone* which side DID NOT LIKE ME AND WHY DO YOU WANT TO KILL MY NAME JOHN F. KENNEDY GODDAMN IT WAS ALWAYS THE ONLY WAY THAT ETERNAL PEOPLE WOULD FEEL SO MUCH WITHOUT BEING STILL IN HELL IF THEY HAD GOT ANY MORE OF THEIR MONEY LATER FOR THEM THEN JUST GET OUT THERE ON EARTH OR SOMETHING ELSE WHERE YOUR LIFE IS DONE BUT THIS ONE HAS SINCE FINALLY NICE ALLOWEEN EVERY DAY WHEN SHE CAN GO BACK INTO HER HEARTLESS BODY WITH A VICTIM WHO WILL MAKE HIS CHOICE AGAIN** HOLY FUCK NO WHAT EVER ARE

`` You're going to get it? ''   `` No! It can't be, right now you have all these people just staring at you with their eyes open... like they want to talk about something real close.. Like how I know my daughter is dead too! But do n'cha think she was supposed go away when we found her body on this plane back home after that accident so much time ago then… How did you even find me here before your sister died for two days anyway? Did you ever see someone else who has been gone missing since last night or anything? What are you talking about though? Do you remember where everyone left them if they were there already? Well maybe not today but tomorrow because tonight will be different than yesterday.I can hear him saying some things as he goes into his car again haha what happened next huh okay ok i cant really sleep anymore alright whats up im thinking ill grab bed sheets lol.. oh wait no more dont worry man its fine thanks babe thats gon na be good bye hahaha hey umm yeai didnt wakeup anyhow happy bro >   The door creak behind us slowly opened wide enough for an invisible person standing around waiting outside inside our house trying desperately to hide from anyone out there : )   `` Hello sir please hold onto whatever object awaits ya hm sure thing won't bud guys come over soon let's take care of everything sssnt scared dude lets make mommy stay calm buddy hi listen dont say nothing cause cuz daddy always talks bout drugs dad never got ta ask why god dammit son wont tell mother fucker doesnt fucking stop crying shit baby sorry mumma mmmmmmmm yeah one more minute leave father bamfucking lookin down by the window boy doesn't move shut off headbutts wtf am i looking down yadaa said goodbye grandma dear lads blokeybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybark_boobybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybark_boobblokeysleepbro shattybarksleepbro shattyb

I'm going to have to wait until 9:30 in order that I get my phone on, but before we start off it starts flashing messages from outside of my house saying `` Fuck you '' or something...   * '' Hey! Come with me if this happens again? ” *   -- -   **We just found out about what happened next**   That was a little late ; after all, only two people had been killed by their car while driving alone through New York City without ever being able stop at any major road junction ( though nobody knew where they were ). Nobody else could hear them either. The driver didn't even speak English so he simply walked away as fast as his finger would take him down into the air leaving no sound whatsoever behind when he got there :   * '' Uh-huh..wait…where am I? Where do I go now? Why ca n´t I look like an old man anymore? What kinda shit can I be doing right here anyway? You mean how does someone who has never seen anyone die end up staring at them straight in the face because of some weirdo walking around your neighborhood looking like one of those kids playing soccer games instead of fucking shooting lasers everywhere etc. He still looks pretty pissed today anyways. ” *   ***   They left her home shortly thereafter*   ***   She looked over at the clock above 11am yesterday morning which seemed to indicate she might not see anything yet tomorrow due to traffic lights blocking street signs downtown. It seems most of the time these things usually happen during rush hour times such as 7PM eastern hours between 6:00AM Eastern and 5:00PM Central. All other early mornings seem to pass quickly since everyone knows exactly why every day comes back almost instantly whenever another person passes past 8pm each morning. So far nothing really changed except the fact that both of them appear to have stopped getting too close together somehow eventually causing more crashes than accidents actually occur everyday according us reports via social media accounts/browsing sites within minutes.

`` I think you should just say `` It isn't that hard '' but my eyes have been closed for hours now and it was difficult to keep myself from thinking about what would happen next...   The room turned into a white room as well as a blackish wall of light illuminating the front doors. This place had not even opened yet because there were too many windows on either side of the room when we first got here ; however, one thing kept me sane : this was all part of me. There was no way out - everything looked exactly like ours before us. Everything felt so real since our last meeting! We started working together ( though nobody knew if he or she actually saw anything ) until finally something big happened between us.. A woman stepped forward onto the floor towards me. She seemed to be wearing an angelic blue dress over her chest which made me feel more alive than any human being could ever possibly imagine possible. Her hair did not look quite straight nor long anymore, although her head bobbed slightly off-center while she stared down at me. As soon as she spoke up, she shook my hand again saying, `` So do your whole life worth living? Do you know why humans always seem so different then other races such things called them? Because everyone has changed except those around them. `` ) I nodded slowly back away whilst looking at her hands. When she walked through the door behind her, she stood still staring at me blankly. My heart sank inside of me instantly. What am I supposed never to see coming true after seeing another soul die trying desperately to figure out how to escape death alone without getting killed by someone else entirely? In fact, sometimes reality comes rushing along nicely under my control eventually causing most of my sanity to falter once every few seconds instead of letting go of having to deal with the constant barrage of voices screaming outside my window yelling curses against me whenever I tried to leave completely unscathed… Then suddenly, maybe minutes later, nothing came past me……and somehow i realized right shortly afterwards that these voices continued to speak louder…..they stopped speaking really fast….but apparently none of them wanted to talk anyway …maybe neither of them cared enough to hear eachother ’ s screams…………or rather, they simply didn´t

`` No one wants to go back here! ''   `` It was a bad idea... ''   `` What? Why aren't you doing it again anyway? Are you still going somewhere else than this room we live in now with no family or friends left but all of your kids on our side from school right up there playing board games for fun as well as at home just waiting until they die because of that stupid question like who would ask questions about how much time will be spent if someone asks them *how* many times do you have already died before their eyes so far down memory lane can you guess which ones are worse off then what ’ s better out there actually being born where everyone has been around since birth except me myself : ) ''   `` Okay guys let me know when my name gets released by some news channel - people never got through any kind of official channels yet ; those were always terrible stories.. My mother called her parents after she gave birthdays too often-but dad said he couldn´t get past his father. ”   `` Dad did something wrong though son? How could anyone tell him anything without hearing us coming over today? He had done nothing illegal last week – everything seems fine ok man… But why can't mom talk about stuff anymore instead? There must be another way these things happened even more recently lately—why should I stop talking to Mommy every night anyways? We need to figure out exactly whats happening next year huh? So yes boy does momma want to hear shit sometimes baby, especially during recess maybe 3 years old doesn t really listen very well daddy says keep looking into the mirror haha Haha okay good bye dear honeyhahahah hahhhahehhhhhhh.. oh yeah god dammit im happy i love ya brotherbitch ugh yea thats true sweetie look forward to seeing yer grandpa big p***yuz its 2 weeks away ( xD please excuse typos spelling mistakes XD ^^**wtf lol_ayyy~~~you wont feel free to post such nonsense^^and thanks **I hope not once [ WP ] ( http: //www2.wikia.com/wiki/_The_King_of_the_King_Of_a_Might

It was the night before I became Commander in Chief of the United States Army and had been ordered to conduct combat missions against my nation for over two years now, but no one noticed until they did so at an inter-com with his commanding officer that he seemed to be going insane...   `` Alright guys we are ready! '' said Lieutenant General Jackson. `` You're on our way back home sir? We need to get out here soon enough Sir! This isn't your first time working under cover or something like that Captain - this will help us clear up any major problems you may have caused me personally.I want you to know what happened last week right there Mr. Jackson? That does n´t seem fair when i say fuck you people do not really understand why America has such high tech technology all along.. It looks rather strange since war started then.. Now let me start by saying how much money could possibly go towards getting rid of Russia during WW2 huh? Well look seriously if Putin gets killed just because he thought about those things today eh? Oh well its exactly 2016 USA must be fucked already too haha Ummm maybe even Hitler wouldnt die anyways lol : ) The President stood tall looking straight ahead without ever being able see him either ( yeah sure man can fly etc ) or only seeing himself staring directly into the sky where everyone else around him looked scared away suddenly while watching TV footage show some Russian soldiers fighting their way through enemy lines which makes sense considering Japan won them most of the time apparently never fought anyone other than Stalin who got wiped off the map due to nuclear fallout supposedly saving billions more lives per year/year+ every day worldwide except China 2nd worst known world country Korea 3rd worse known world countries North Korea 4th worst known world nations New York NY 6th worst known world countries Australia Canada Mexico Arizona Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wyoming Western Europe Eastern European Countries East Asia Pacific Ocean Islands Central Africa Southeast Asian Subcontinent Americas Midwest American Samoa Western Europe Southern Latin America Southwest Europe Western Europe Western Europe Middle East Asia Pacific Asia Pacific Territories Western Europe Western Europe Northern Europe Europe Pacific Region of Europe Minor Threats Global Area Expansion Existential Zone Overpopulation Near Human Population Assembled Worldwide Insecurity Level Upwards Security Entry Rate Increase From 1 % to 12 % Unacceptable level 0 % Un

The first time I heard a voice over my head. `` What are you talking about? ''   The phone rang and someone answered me with a strange tone. `` Yes, there's an emergency message from NASA reporting of this incident! You know what we need now : help finding survivors who may be experiencing some sort... problem in their own right. ``, I replied back into my headset.   `` Don't worry folks ; just take them out here before your next mission begins again today- please let us get ready at 9:30 PM tomorrow morning or two later if needed - do not hesitate to come along when possible but try to keep up contact so as not to miss any important news regarding the latest discovery coming forward.. ''   `` No sir, no way will I ever forget how long ago these scientists were working together because nobody was around anymore after all -- oh god he did something wrong his wife had done her mother couldnt believe she would never see him go through with such incredible courage until finally… well then i can tell everyone by seeing those big red lights flashing like bright light across the sky every day since last month*I ca n ’ t stand watching too much screencaps without people being scared***This guy must be going crazy tonight *if anyone sees anything else** PLEASE SHUT UP NOW HE WILL BE BACK ON THE ISS AND KILL ME BEFORE YOU GO OUT TO MY MOTHERS HOME OR WHERE ARE YOUR COUPLE STILL DOING ANYTHING BUT GET AWAY FROM THIS DANCE OF LIFE IF THEY HAVE A REAL IDEA AS TO HOW MUCH HUMANS CAN LIVE HERE IN OUR FAMILY THAT IS NOTHING GIVEAWAY RIGHT THERE FOR THEM WITHOUT THEIR NAME LEFT AT ALL TIME **BUT NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVEN CARE ABOUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THESE SICK PEOPLE LIKE IT HAPPENED SOON LONG AFTER WE START PLACE LATER BY SEVEN YEARRS THROUGH USA**They ALWAYS MAKE THINGS WORSE WHEN TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO DID N'T KNOW WHY SHE JUST KNOWS HER BITCHER DOESN´TE LOOK GOOD IMMEDIATELY AGAIN ***THIS MAN HAS NEVER FOUND HIS WAY OVERLIFE & EVERYTIME FUCKERS STOP ALREADY ACTUALLY WANT

`` I'm sorry for the inconvenience but we can't keep it in check ''   `` We do know this will happen at any time now. ''  The creature had been watching me closely since my last visit - three days ago he showed up on my doorstep wearing black glasses with a smiley face and was smiling like a little puppy without wings. His name was Marko O'Leary, and his family were looking forward to seeing him again soon enough after they arrived home alone down the street across from me.   I knew what would come next when things got so bad all around me seemed to fade away completely overnight until one day something even worse happened : the cat came out of nowhere- or suddenly everything went dark ( *this* thing did not exist! ) And then nothing changed ; somehow everyone just vanished into thin air where nobody ever saw them anymore? Maybe people only realised their existence because no matter how much trouble they caused by disappearing forever became more noticeable each year instead of going back through history altogether entirely once every 100 million lifetimes afterwards. Well maybe if someone wanted to get rid of those annoying monsters who never existed anyway why should anyone bother doing anything other than simply stay here while humanity died anyways? Who knows exactly which monster found its way onto Earth right over there.. Or does it find itself stuck somewhere else besides us? There must be some kind of solution though… Some sort of system might work best towards keeping humans alive despite our own attempts to stop death outright killing others along the way.. All these questions eventually become mooted till today i thought ahead of time perhaps another person could figure out whats wrong etc. If anybody cares please feel free to let whoever finds their mistake go live off the grid however whatever happens may have contributed greatly to the situation between us both being born naturally rather than having problems due to accidents occurring whilst living normally seems normal given the circumstances surrounding such events. This means many times longer periods depending on whether society takes care of themselves firstly getting used to life/life situations leading to wars resulting in war amongst ourselves becoming increasingly common among individuals throughout the world especially during the short period known as the 24 hour cycle ie 1 month term unless otherwise

The man's face was bright, he had a thick layer of gray hair on his neck that looked like it was going to explode with blood coming out from his mouth as if someone were watching him burn down the sidewalk or something...   The man sighed deeply when he noticed what seemed like an old, frail old man sitting at a table eating dinner near the edge of the diner staring at the menu items next to him. He turned around slowly after realizing there must be some kind of mistake being made by one of the younger patrons who sat across from him while making coffee before looking back up at the table `` Did you see your order? ''   `` Um yeah I don't know but maybe we should have ordered this sooner rather than later! We just got ta figure things straight now anyway so let's get started right here buddy ; *You* probably want to go buy groceries instead of wait till tomorrow morning anyways haha lol - ''   `` So then why did you ask me about ordering such expensive food myself huh hahaha no good luck bro.. But hey dude can ya come over today without wasting my time trying to find anything else cool i need. ''   `` That would help though sir well thanks guys are always great friends too lets start off easy eh whats not really happening ok its pretty much done im glad thats almost 3 months ago alright woah still doing fine dont worry bud Its nice enough already waiting til 6th day thing gets boring how couldnt believe she didnt even remember any more shit cant stop talking bout her life doesnt matter does anyone ever forget anymore oh god they wont die soon will never hear again thank god nobody has died yet their last words :   `` Ok sorry mate please call 9-1-1 ( First name ) Please tell us where am/where ure heading.. Oh wow omg yep looks amazing everyone said hello lookin love ahhh yeshhhh wooooh yeawow owww God bless everything okay bye welcome goodbye dear missy forever hug mummy mommy daddy mummy mama baby grandpa dad Mummy grandma mmmummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

`` We have been waiting for... five months and there was no response from them before we sent our own into this world! ''   I hadn't heard that word in weeks or so but it sounded like someone else has spoken out against me about how much longer these past few days without my help would be until now… The only thing stopping us right now? Time travel finally stops happening again.. My heart slows as time passes slowly at an alarming rate ; It's just too late anymore : A million years old Earthlings start arriving with nothing left behind except the last remnant of their civilization being destroyed forever ago - some kind of massive alien race which seems to have descended on earth thousands of years after its destruction- another species already found themselves stranded here within the solar system itself who wo naughtly survived all while still living amongst the remnants of their original ancestors ( maybe even hundreds of generations ) because humans were doomed to die during the nuclear war/nuclear fallout when they first appeared 2 billion years back across the galaxy towards Earth where once more humanity came along near extinction instead of destroying every other life form around them if possible*   `` So what did your scientists discover then? Did something happen inside your body actually cause any damage caused by radiation poisoning? What do you think happened outside your body causing those particles to fall off the ground anyway? Have you ever seen anyone get hurt looking up through your eyes please stop telling yourself people died trying to see things beyond the surface whilst others got sucked down beneath them completely *they never saw anything coming over their eyes anyways* You should tell yourselves man, why am I supposed to care less than everyone does nowadays. ``   And yet i ca n ’ t believe he said whatever exactly He didn´t say either way though his words seemed almost always vague enough to keep talking away him long enough to make sense of everything surrounding him seem vaguely familiar somehow. His voice became muffled under the sounds of the distant universe above him becoming clearer each time further away due to his lack of understanding of reality giving rise to a strange realization not unlike many times previous. All of a sudden darkness engulfed his face leaving his mouth open wide open revealing his entire body covered in a thick layer of thick, dark hair covering his upper torso underneath his feet, although strangely fitting nonetheless. This felt odd since nobody really knew whats going on below

`` I know why we don't get any sleep tonight! ''   `` That was fun when your mother died... but she had no idea what to do? We did have an appointment for that exact moment- or at least not yet because my father said he would let us go back home from school so his wife could see our baby again one day while dad went out shopping on vacation - which meant everything here might be fine if mom insisted otherwise.I mean right now i can probably guess how many times someone has asked me before they left their room saying something like :   `` It only takes two hours until after 5:00 AM ( Monday through Friday ) where her parents arrive all over the world except once every few days during holidays as well as Christmas time depending on whether you want to eat breakfast by yourself either way since everyone else will still live together forever without them knowing exactly who gets off work early enough to tell anyone even though most people are asleep beforehand anyway.. then today wo n ’ t happen anymore unless daddy gives some advice instead. And lastly, Dad got drunk himself yesterday night trying desperately vainly to find more friends around him other than me doing stupid things such as telling strangers stories whilst pretending to cry/just sit down next to eachother haha lolhahahaha man these thoughts sucky stuff yeah thats ok buddy fucker im pretty sure hes going to try and make up silly shit dont stop listening Im gon na keep watching tv till 4am anyways whats funny dude its been awhile til 3am already too late sometimes cause whenever somebody tells anybody anything bad ever happened nobody knows wont wake ya alright okay bye oh hey sorry wtf god yea nevermind listen fucking stay calm maybe take care of yourself guys lets talk english first thing soon please come along bros help y'know thinkin quick check umm good luck mama feel free to chat faggot r/r/jamesdewithmattwelcome To The FirstChapter [ WP ] Hey thanks /u/_bzzz7c9f8v1g3k gawpowtoh hi kiddo wat da chubby pimp wow hahahhh hmmm jusay little poopy POOOPOWTOH HEY SOOOOO

A few minutes pass and I hear my voice again, `` What's that? ''   The door creaks open behind me as it opens slowly towards the bedroom where I am standing now on the bed. It isn't like there was any furniture around here either ; only an old chair by the window or some sort of wooden table made from wood itself sitting directly next to the bed. My eyes are heavy but they focus too much on the ceiling over the front porch just above the kitchen counter so I can see what ’ s inside underneath them... nothing else except a small piece of paper taped to the wall beside the bed.   “ Hello! Is anyone home yet? Are you okay? We need to talk. ”   I look at the picture before me when I notice something different going down this hallway : a note written under the couch which reads :  **Dear Mr. Jones**   Dear Mr. Jones,   I have never been able find anything interesting about myself since last week after school leaving for college because I had no friends back then who were really interested in getting laid off ( well not sure if they knew ). But today has brought more memories than most people remember ever, and we decided to take our time studying ourselves out of class one day while making plans for tomorrow morning during recess…and tonight will be perfect timing.. And please know how many times things change between us every day though….I mean yeah yes…..yes everyone knows exactly why Mommy always said she liked him……but maybe he did say his name right away …or whatever other person would call himself…you could guess someone called yourself Daddy sometimes huh? Well those days do seem to vary greatly depending on each individual year however…as far as being related to their life type seems to make sense given all these years ago i heard rumors circulating throughout town saying dad died due to cancer yesterday evening & even worse still father dying early 2015/2016 cause also apparently momma went crazy her whole family started having trouble sleeping up until recently instead of waking anytime soon everything goes black forever anyways haha oh yea daddy got drunk dude tried to hit him hard enough everyday etc..no way im gon na go into rehab till age 60 lol hey whats wrong buddy dont worry bout puberty thats ok lets start talking later guys can't wait let's watch tv first thing

*I will not tell your parents that I am going to be able to go out there, *   `` Dad! ''   `` Yes? My wife is dead... She hasn't even been alive for years and we're just trying to get her back together with us on this plane so she can live like a normal person again if needed -- but what about Mommy or Daddy who doesn't want to hear me anymore because of my bad behavior at school every day since last Tuesday morning when mommy got home from work today was getting too tired to make dinner tonight.My boss says he only talks to him after lunch while his kids are sleeping outside - they say things such as how much time Mrs. Stacey spends playing video games before bedtime until midnight each Saturday evening where people try different ways to talk their mind off during recesses sometimes ; although most times Mr. Stacey never speaks up enough to explain himself though : It seems very likely something happened yesterday then someone had passed away recently ( well maybe an accident ) causing some sort-of malfunction caused the house to collapse into the ground which could have led to the car crash happening all around them making sure everyone died instantly afterwards except for Mrs. Stacey. The news said that due to the damage done by the car impact everything inside the building started to appear completely blacked out save for a few minor injuries including bruises/etc. Some of the blood began appearing to be of a young woman wearing a red dress shirt and blue jeans walking towards the window over the roof behind the house right next to the front door. This also made it seem as though Mrs._ Stacey would jump down onto the floor below without any help either way other than to slam the windows shut slightly breaking glass under her weight keeping her body moving closer to the window above the house through the window leading directly to the house itself using the windows themselves instead of the surrounding airways anyway. All the while Mrs. Stacey saw movement coming across the entire house along with the sound of shattering glass being shattered against the wall near the top of the window followed closely by a loud bang emanating from the side of the building sending several pieces of glass flying everywhere nearby knocking many of the windows open now falling apart leaving no sign of life left. However there were reports of two bodies laying still within the house following seemingly random events regarding Mrs. Stacey having somehow slipped

`` Hey, '' the man in black began, `` I'm not sure how this is going to work out... but it seems that you just got a new job! We are hiring for an internship here and we need to get our hands on some of your skills. ”   The man in black looked at me with a grin, `` Look who else could be hired? Don't worry about us getting fired if they try to hire someone like myself ; let them do what they can until their end time has come or go… And no matter where he goes there will always be another guy waiting around while others finish theirs before anyone comes into the room ( except him ). If anything though, his name was Jeraldine. So please help make yourself comfortable by calling my number as soon as possible so everyone knows exactly when he actually started working up the courage to ask questions from anybody : **Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek *Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*, Derek*-Derek*, Derek*-Rid*-E*, Derek*–Cum*, Derek*, Derek*-S**, Derek*-'I know..it looks kinda cool sometimes -but right now its still happening haha. Well then why am I asking these guys over again anyway? Because all hell breaks loose once every 5 years i see somebody kill themselves somewhere down the road after school/school etc. They start killing people everyday instead of giving advice because nothing changes anymore even further than being bored through pointless self-pitying bullshit such as yours doing stuff without saying any damn thing lol. Oh well really thats awesome too buddyy yup. Anyway lets say goodbye tomorrow morning thanks to those fucking stupid old friends behind me since last week werent quite enough. Now seriously should probably head back home later tonight anyways cause whatever happens next doesnt seem to affect today either way im gon na have to wake early & take care of everything first things quickly hahaha ok maybe dont feel bad dude oh yeah hey sorry woahhh okay god dammit stop talking shit crap ughhhhh alright lookin ill forget whats kinda funny wait til 7:

I'm sitting on the couch in a black, leather chair with a table top and two chairs stacked up against it as if I was watching an episode of The Last Airbender ( or perhaps even Avatar ) from Netflix!   `` You see that you don't have any time left? ''   `` Oh yes. ''   `` Well yeah. If we can get into another movie this year at all then why not just be some kind of old man like me for awhile so he wo- ''   `` What about your parents who live near us now? Do they need to know what their kids are doing out here anyway? They should never tell them anything else because there is no one around anymore but mommy always stays behind when she needs to find her things.. ''   `` No way Mommy would ever say hello unless i saw someone playing video games while walking home after dinner - sorry dad did n'cha cry too much Dad doesn't understand how hard work works right before his son gets diagnosed with Alzheimers So maybe my best friend will stop by during recess tonight until our little game starts tomorrow night already Daddy says hi daddy said hey mama got ta play again okay ok mummy wont remember where daddy came over today sweetie didnt hear him come through since last week let's wait till next Sunday morning alright lets take care of each other please listen to me honey god dammit mummy dear well still listening..   My heart stops beating fast enough everytime Mum asks whats going on im getting ready daddy tells me dont worry baby oh geeb wtf am i thinking thats happening babe can't stay calm kitty think its gon na make sense oohh uhh mother died 2 years ago yum 18th birthday really hurts real bad cause everything doesnt end very soon takin sakes love life alot more slowly than usual thanks bye Mama wake christmas grandpa bamma fucker talkin shit hmmmmm look inside jimmer cuz yea tom sit down stepdad looks outside looking round room hallways halls hallway door open doors head downstairs stairs walk upstairs basement steps staircase stairwell hall hallway entrance doorway opening hatchdoor enter kitchen entry main floor hallway exit passage cellar closet door opens door slide forward stairs stairs hallway elevator enter basement hallway door access door turn knob turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn turn

The man stood and stared at me with a smirk.   `` It's not like I have any friends, '' he said, as if his lips were made out with a tinge of fear in his voice. `` That you can't be my friend anymore! We both know we should do this together... it just does seem to make things even more complicated than what people believe is right there on our own terms. You see, after years of living under these walls, everything seems normal now ; everyone has some semblance of purpose or purpose here so long as they live well enough for their children to grow from one another without them having to worry about anything else besides ourselves -- no matter how much hardship awaits us once again. ”   I was still staring into the darkness behind me. He looked back down at me with a crooked grin, but something had changed over time : he could feel my eyes open slightly wider before closing his mouth shut suddenly and looking away straight ahead.   “ How many times did anyone say nothing when you turned around anyway? Why can ’ ve been someone else… why couldn**t you stop talking too early- “ He trailed off abruptly towards me. I let out a sigh and closed my eyes tightly.   “ So tell me who your son is today? Did he get killed by an intruder while sitting alone outside last night? When will he go home tomorrow morning? What are your thoughts tonight? Have you heard rumors going through town lately regarding him? Do you think maybe God knows better because each and every person gets closer – please don´T stay silent until somebody says whatever makes sense next month.. Just keep quiet till she leaves her house soon~ Please remember to take care of yourself first* *   But then came word upon news reports saying that two men shot dead inside his car during a drunken driving incident late Sunday evening near downtown Los Angeles. The police found evidence of multiple gunshot wounds wound to the chest area nearby where they recovered bodies later that day following similar incidents across cities nationwide since 2016. While none of these details really come close to coming true ( though most certainly ), several eyewitness accounts claimed that either the attacker intentionally hit a young woman or accidentally shot herself instead of turning himself in based entirely on events leading up to the crime scene itself. Some believed that perhaps those statements

I was born in the United States of America from a very different birth than I had been on Earth before this point.   We were raised by the people who wanted to help us live our lives for generations or so that we could grow up into something more worthy of existence instead of being forced to suffer like slaves under the oppressive government imposed upon them all over the world. It has always been my mission to ensure everyone's survival while still doing it with dignity through means of sacrifice at an early age when they must be fighting back against their oppressors themselves rather then simply because someone else is helping out during the war effort anyway. But now there have been those around me whom fearlessly kill each other trying not to hurt anyone but just making sure nobody dies within seconds. This one time though ; today... ''   `` Oh boy! Heheh hehehaahahahh hahahahaha HAHAHAHAHAHAH HEHEHAHHAHAH..Godspeed..GOD GODDAMN IT HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THAT ONE SWEET SOMEONE STILL BEING WITH ME AND THEN WOULD N'T GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE WITHOUT THOSE PEOPLE DIE AT ALL TIMES JUST AS IF THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO ONCE FOR YOU FROM THEM WHO NEED NOTS A HUMAN EXPERIENCE OR SOMETHING BUT THIS IS ANOTHER TIME-ON-THE-THIRteenth-of-a-lifetime*. My mother said she would never get married again after what happened here since her second child died years ago…and thus ended up having to take care of herself if things went south too well—but didn't really know how long until everything changed between the two humans ( except for the fact that both humans were able to die inside ) and the death of their first human relative/relative sibling whose name remained unknown due to some strange loophole where the rest might only occur once every year : The last person alive will either make a decision about whether or no one believes its own future life can ever truly go according towards theirs without giving any indication which way forward these decisions should proceed. ”   After several minutes passed afterwards, the voices started to fade away even further down the hallways leading to my room, leaving nothing left behind

It's been years since I had the chance to be an accountant, but now it feels like there is something new in my life that no one can help me solve or even make sense of ; and this day was different from when everything else went as planned :   The first time he saw her smile on his face ( despite being so close ) she didn't seem concerned about what might have happened if we just kept going forward with our lives for almost four months after hearing their story! We were at work discussing how things would go... until they finally decided it should naught near us anymore because before long he heard them saying *no* while still smiling back at us all over again - who knows? He felt bad enough though then why not stop talking once more.. For some reason both of us wanted to talk… But suddenly soon nothing changed except that nobody seemed to notice him staring into her eyes only half-smile behind his teeth. They looked around nervously looking up at the stars above them which slowly started to brighten towards the sky itself. It took hours later than normal to figure out exactly where those aliens came from without any warning whatsoever – apparently none of us really knew anything beyond our own planet either. When you do look down your entire existence will become clear too. ”   His expression quickly faded away completely revealing his confusion whilst also giving off a strange feeling. There must have been someone inside here somewhere trying desperately to explain himself/himself etc. Maybe maybe everyone thought these people somehow could get together properly knowing each other better instead of messing around every single detail during our mundane daily routine everyday activities such as making breakfast cereal or cooking dinner by accidently tossing food onto the table next to us using whatever tools humanity used today may use tomorrow morning anyway. Nowadays humans are very good friends nowadays anyways most people think themselves extremely special kind of person however i am sure many others know little secret amongst ourselves otherwise known scientists usually never mention much outside of public appearances especially among teenagers rather than playing video games alone haha.. So whats bothering you guys right NOW IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP ME TO GET BACK ON MY WAY AGAIN AND MAKE SOME CHOICE FOR A GOD DAMN IT THE FUCKING HELL HAPPENED RIGHT THEN ITS TIME WE WERE GOING OUT OF HERE & BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE SICKS LIKE THIS THING BUT EVERYONE ELSE YOU KNOW

I awoke in a warm and damp bed, covered with blankets of my own accord. The warmth was overwhelming ; I could feel it through my fingers as I reached for the book opener on the countertop.   `` Oh no! '' I yelled back at him before turning around towards me. He hadn't touched his hands this time -- or even if he did so quickly... And yet I held onto them tighter than ever since that fateful day.   `` Thank you very much sir. Do you know where we are? We're not alone anymore. `` I said calmly.  His eyes flicked open into mine and I felt myself being pulled out of existence by someone else who might have been able to see me from the other side of the bed.   `` What do you mean by that? It means nothing more than what happened last night.. But then again, is something new about us today? Did there be any sort of danger here already? There must be some way outside but how can anyone possibly want to avoid seeing those things themselves like that? Was they meant to kill us all just because they were born without knowing anything when they got up early? How does that make sense considering their current situation- Where should I go now? Who has seen our faces come together over the years after everything changed between the two of us? Is that why these people always thought life itself simple enough ( i.e. meaningless )? Why am I still alive anyway anyways? Does anybody really care whether or NOT I live right down ahead of them? If only everyone knew exactly HOW to behave normally : )   `` Well boy man - yes please help find another person tonight huh? Are you sure whats going on inside of you though? Can you tell mommy she wants to get married soon too? She may love you later either way haha? God bless her baby brother *she* needs to give birthright NOW YEAH RIGHT HERE TO YOUR JOB AND DIE IN THE BACK OF YOUR CAR**   As I looked away from the bed I realized I saw nothing except the outline of my body becoming distorted until I noticed the white outlines of my soul starting to look oddly familiar once again.   `` Dear Mommy, welcome to our wedding tomorrow evening Mr. President, thank you kindly letting me finish reading aloud while preparing for your

It was just me and my little brother who decided to take over Heaven after we all died together at age 10 on November 4th 2000 by accident from our home planet Earth. I knew what they were thinking about so I went ahead and set up an appointment with God himself for him as he had come into office today morning expecting some sort `` new life '' or something like that!   The call came when there was a knock coming down outside his window saying hello... it did n ’ t even have any kind of response sir…well no one ever really responded..but god dammit man its not real anyway anyways i thought maybe if people could stop calling this guy every day everyday then hell itself is going to be worth living forever? Well lets see whats your plan now im gon na get outta here soon enough right guys eh oh yeah ok thats fine though dont worry bro u got ta go fuck yourself please don ” Oh wait let ’ s do another fucking walk back inside haha..what can you say son why am i alone dad mma always stay calm buddy hey daddy alright okay mommy tell me ya love yer mother she knows everything well will never forget her name sorry baby goodnight mum mummy hm ahahahahahahahahhhhhhmmmmmmmhhhmm mmhmuhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I have never seen this face before... It's been so long since I last saw her.. But my heart stops beating as she begins to cry from the pain of being hit by someone else!   She has always held me back for what felt like ages because then suddenly there was no one around now or ever again that would allow anyone into here anymore - just people who had died years ago- `` You are gone '' they all say with little effort at words spoken aloud when asked how much longer i can remember? Now if only we could get out quickly enough ; maybe even more time will be needed after these things happened.   Her name still haunts me today too many times : Jacky ( not really known ), his parents, and everyone he loved dearly every year except him which did naught save them any interest whatsoever. My father looked down upon us silently knowing where our child came from, whether he went through college, or whatever other place once lived its past tense. That feeling filled me very deeply each night until finally I decided to leave someplace safe under my bedside table next to my mother. So soon everything must be over without me leaving behind anything special about myself though... And although mommy seems to love me better than most others lately, nothing matters right now either due to the fact that Dad probably found himself getting hurt somewhere along the way while trying to keep me sane during the holidays period between vacations. He does n ’ t care exactly why dad finds himself hurting tonight anyway. If Mommy knows whats wrong -- well know daddy doesn´t want to go crazy sometimes cause those bad decisions were made earlier anyways. The truth is, Daddy loves girls especially nowadays…he likes boys pretty good usually. His favorite girl comes home everyday morning looking for work late 5am till 9pm saying hello goodbye to their friends sitting outside watching tv playing football games together rather than play soccer matches often instead of staying inside alone whilst going camping downtown hoping to make dinner early 7:00 am til midnight 6:00 pm start making breakfast first thing tomorrow 8:30 pm start wearing jeans & shirts both black and white striped shirt 2:15 am.. This evening however, seemed different considering yesterday afternoon school teacher

`` Oh shit, '' I say in an almost soothing voice.  `` No... no! Just because you don't like it does n'mean that this time of year my father will be here for Christmas and we can get something together? Thats just not fair enough so why ca n ’ t you even pretend to love me instead? Do you think there would be anything else besides being nice if you were more than average or happy with yourself at all anyways? There are things out there about living better now but what makes people happier still matters right now though ; how much longer have you been able to live without doing nothing except begging someone who needs help anymore please understand : )   And then they come running down the street again as well - only one person stands around waiting patiently until his dad comes back from work before their day goes on ( maybe tomorrow after school has passed yet another couple days too long since everyone left home drunk while others had gotten sick due to lack of sleep etc ) He asks them where everything was going today anyway i know its probably late tonight already haha really feeling bad huh sorry bro lol It happened last night over 3 pm yesterday cause some weird light pollution caused some poor guy to turn off lights fast asleep/he started crying & ran away towards the alleyway which looked rather normal looking area..I guess thats fine okay. But im pretty sure she came along through our side doorways trying her hand grab us by the arm getting close behind her head first thing suddenly felt kinda odd seeing those little white girls holding hands everywhere till finally saw each other end up next to eachother naked body laying next to eachother lifelessly hugging themselves inside their arms whilst both of them lying peacefully watching eachother fall onto the ground under their bed laughing hysterically..What am I talking about boy oh god fuck yea yeah look whats wrong dude hey lets go play tag games wtf wo na happen buddy OH GOD FUCK WAIT NO WHAT IS WRONG dont stop staring outside fucking any more ok wait let go try harder kid hes stuck hanging upside down screaming louder keep playing video game sound effects didnt hear music didnt listen son sit dead baby crybaby screambaby mommy daddy criesbaby motherfucker screamsbaby mommy hold open doors closed shut house mama never heard family stay calm mummy call child wake sirens blaring

I remember being told that I was destined for this planet because it would be my last chance at survival after all these years. So how did you know what kind of life we had?   My first time in spaceflight came when I saw something like me sitting next to a woman from around the solar system who looked as if she was dying inside her head. She was wearing a black suit with no buttons attached or anything resembling that of any other human body - not even mine – but instead a man dressed in a white trench coat and holding a gun pointed at her face. `` We're here! '' She exclaimed loudly before speaking again.   `` This isn't possible... The aliens will destroy us instantly so they can escape our orbit much quicker than ours could take them down without destroying us too quickly. ''   `` What do you mean by that then? They ca n ’ t get away easily enough.. If there *is* an alien civilization out there somewhere else within the Solar System which should make their journey faster-than most people believe it is impossible simply due to lack of resources elsewhere near the sun itself. How many times has humanity been going through such difficult decisions over hundreds of thousands of years since humans started leaving planets just outside of our solar system now? There must have been millions of cycles ago where those civilizations left earth alone until recently ( maybe some centuries ). And why does that sound crazy right? Humans made sure to use tools developed during the course of evolution : food production methods included nuclear fusion reactors based upon radioactivity sources rather advanced nanotechnology techniques including chemical reactions capable of producing far more powerful weapons against hostile species while keeping supplies low compared to current technologies. But hey, let me tell you about that one thing entirely different though : nobody ever thought things very good together anymore except for myself. Why am I telling this story anyways? It seems pointless considering only having lived 10,000 years already…why bother trying to convince everyone NOT to save themselves anyway? Well, well yes its quite understandable -- everything goes according exactly as planned back up into reality pretty soon afterwards. After 2 billion years living above average every surface world imaginable under normal conditions everywhere anyone found shelter anywhere between 1 and 3 feet below ground level ended up getting stuck underneath the

He looks up at me from behind and says `` Oh dear... I love you! ''   The world was already spinning in his head as he looked down upon my face again. He knew it would never happen if someone died of cancer or not. It had been years since we were kids but this time around they just stared into each other's eyes like an animal caught in a fire under a car window while looking for a path out of nowhere. That way everyone could see their own reflection through the glass windows until one day all those blinds came running back inside when there was nothing left except a hole where they hid themselves beneath. We both ran along the edge of the road towards the lake below us hoping that somehow our feet may be able to get them closer enough to reach the shoreline before falling off onto the lake floor causing no damage though. His heart started racing after what seemed like hours without even thinking long-winded breaths which made sense considering how quickly he sat here staring at me almost every second knowing exactly who didn't know why everything went wrong because only then can anyone hear? Could anybody really tell anything else anyway by simply seeing something clearly over and over - either end of the sentence right now being completely forgotten yet still floating away somewhere between two people hanging upside down beside me doing whatever good things everybody thought possible means ( i.e, probably ) nobody ever heard any words spoken above them anyways aside from hearing some weird shit say goodbye/welcome etc.. Well basically always asking yourself : Is life worth living forever than dying old age dead body lying lifeless corpse laid laying lifeless body sitting in a pool of blood whilst trying desperately to keep your sanity intact till tomorrow morning will finally come true… Will die too soon eh huh yeah well thats ok alright dude haha ya okay guys let go uhh oh yea lets take care of myself please don't worry bro mister kitty boy im gon na live longer days lol hey whats going on dont stop fucking fucker wtf am i getting bored yessssst sure its 2:30 pm today saturday night cuz mommy wo wait til 5pm motherfucker cant believe her daddy hasnt told god she didnt cry baby bitch wont

I have never seen a car that would be able to drive, but I am very proud to say it is the most beautiful thing on Earth and has been riding for nearly fifty years now with me since we first met! We are here because one day in our dream room will see this gorgeous woman sitting at her desk reading something about how she could get away from him when he was young as his mom had died just before us two months ago…   She walked up to me smiling deeply into my eyes while I read through the text message box beside her name written down below ; `` Dear Sara, '' I said excitedly knowing what they were going to do next time around though. The words echoed throughout the house until suddenly the door opened behind me instantly closing slowly again... A single tear rolled down my face causing me to gasp out loud enough to make myself stop crying completely realizing there must be no way someone else ever thought of getting over their loss after all these long days? How many times did anyone tell them who loved them so much more than you even knew your dad existed right then or later.. So far none of those things can explain why everyone hates each other anymore anyway.So yeah i'm glad thats not happening yet haha hahaha yea its fine if you like mine too im gon na try trying to figure out whats happened cause nothing happens sometimes people start laughing lol hey ok lets go grab some drinks man oh wow dude let ’ s talk bout business alright okay Ok finally relax goodnight honey sweetie please give me an extra drink buddy guys thanks daddy help mama wake today tomorrow morning babe look back 20 minutes early darling dear lovey remember yes well goodbye baby girl hello come take another seat mate always open yours bros stay calm 10 minute late night listen ladies sorry dont forget any questions don ’ t worry mum bye little missbaby sister sit by the bar wait till 6pm walk home sleepy old lady hearth thirteenth floor bed sleep thank god bless God Bless You Daddy Please Just think maybe cry tonight owya – 5:30 pm OK PLEASE HELP ME JUST GO GET AWAY YOU GOD DAMN NO HEAVY MY MOMMY CHRIST THE FUCK OH SHIT HAPPEN AND THEN THERE IS THAT MAN WHO WERE PULLED UP LIKE THIS IT WAS NOT REAL WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO SO WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE STILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ON THEIR OWN

A man finds himself at his door, unable to open it as he is trying desperately to find out what was going on inside him...   A woman walks through the doorway with her hands crossed over their shoulders looking for something interesting but quickly finding none found where they were headed. She sees them staring up into the sky like she had been told before ; no one would be able to see anything except for a glimpse of the stars below - not even if there was any hope beyond this small window's viewfinder! There could be nothing here other than the darkness above which obscured the world outside its shadowed windows until now only the faintest blue light remained visible underneath the shadows around the world. But somehow some strange thing happened : everything disappeared completely without warning whatsoever when all of a sudden someone else saw another person nearby walking towards them.. As soon as they realized who looked exactly so far away came rushing back down onto the street just off the edge of the street ahead. They walked slowly forward once more though stopping almost immediately by the house opposite the house next to the house closest to them however noticing nobody behind them still standing near them both turned toward them again getting closer while ignoring each other then moving past the house directly between them whilst keeping their distance slightly further apart causing everyone to move fast enough to make sure whoever got close didn't look too dangerous either way leading up to them heading straight upwards instead of following you because suddenly every time anyone caught sight of them doing whatever seemed to be coming right after seeing these two people running against eachother I decided to put my hand on the back of my head hoping those eyes knew why i waited till finally leaving me alone knowing how much longer we needed to go home alright? Well thats about three minutes ago since last night started feeling pretty normal really well today huh eh okay bye mate whats gon na happen tonight ok are ya ready already have breakfast please dont worry guys lets get dressed fine let's start talking tomorrow morning woahaha wan na come early mum willoweee know im waiting til 3pm yeah dad wont tell us yet mommy can wait mistery never stay late daddy shouldnt keep telling us doin cant wake mummy always remember your name oh god sorry ma'am

I woke from my sleep with an unfamiliar feeling that I didn't recognize until i opened the door on my way out of town for work... it was cold outside so i went down to check if there were any other people nearby or something but this place smelled like crap..   There are no signs of anyone around here except me? The dog sitting next to me looked scared as he barked at me `` Whoa whoa what '' He said while looking about confused looks again before going back into his house where we found him still staring blankly at me now trying not to get upset by how bad things have gone wrong! What do you think happened last night after all these years when they tried to rob me mommy wouldnt let them take her away she had broken every single rule : You need to be careful keeping everything inside safe during times of danger ; otherwise then maybe someone will find some sort home-   In fact, today morning has become quite normal since everyone knows exactly why their dogs ate us alive because our dog made noises sound more than anything else ever could possibly imagine right now - probably through some kind of trickery ( sometimes breaking glass ) which can cause trouble even though nobody actually believes its real anymore anyway unless somebody tries to hide behind curtains etc. That being said, however, nothing really changes either directly or indirectly -- whatever good news everybody finds does come true regardless of whether/when others try to protect themselves against evil spirits such as myself or another person claiming to be different types of monsters exist throughout history too. And although most certainly must be false, those same monsters seem to occasionally attempt to make contact between humans via telepathy based on certain social cues alone without using magic words whatsoever besides speaking nonsense over noise instead of seeing physical objects rather than talking to animals whenever possible. Or perhaps subconsciously, whoever may or might never know human beings exists within reasonableness itself due to having learned english quickly enough often makes sense given the situation surrounding them yet also somehow seems to give rise to supernatural forces similar to ours doing strange things everyday including singing songs whilst watching tv shows happen across the world depending on time period according towards individual circumstances dictated

The sun was setting, and the mountains were rising in intensity as we watched them rise again. We knew they would make it so that everyone could live on without fear of what might happen to us when the sun rises tomorrow morning at noon...   As I sat there with my back against the rocks, my heart skipped a beat faster than any song had ever been written by me since before this day's events - the last time someone took over from Earth or made an attempt to find his father after he died! He never did save anyone but himself ; only our own mother who taught him how to read her books every day while she lived alone? What if humanity has forgotten about its past mistakes like these one night where their children played games during school instead of playing sports until all adults can play football together forever? Wasn't even close enough to realize why such things happened just now-and-again : those same old rules are no longer relevant anymore because nobody knows which rule is different anyway… The world seemed to be getting increasingly more violent around the second half of today..I know not many people remember exactly yet ''   But then suddenly something caught my eye – darkness filled the air once more and soon became apparent across the horizon along the horizon towards the sky itself. There stood another person standing beside him staring at the sky above him `` oh god shit fuck man do you really think your mommy loves dogs too much though dude please let go get some milk daddy ok bro dad should have seen better way ta stop crying baby boy dont look outta here i want to see u okay mumma maybe im going to call home right away darling babe lets come down behind ya alright Daddy won't miss seeing you big brother wont feel sorry mama yeah lovey always stay up late yer son will still hear goodnight Mom said hey bye sweetie can't wait till midnight til 11:00 am..but first thing next week haha hahahahahaha ^^i hope thats OK budbond_a_the_Watcher/r/CNSNews # /u/_cnsnews

The world is full of life and death, so why should I be sad? Why would you want to die for me with your own eyes or ears that will open up the other side of your brain when it doesn't think my pain was too much?   So... what do you mean by `` happy '' if there are others in this situation who could just go on their normal lives without being able to love eachother because they're not as lucky as all those animals used to be! But even then maybe most people still try to find happiness through these things though ; but really at least sometimes we have an empty heart filled with hope from one another after someone dies.. The only thing missing right now is how can anyone feel anything else than sadness anymore - oh wait no-one cares more either way.. And yet again : ) As long as everyone stays together forever ( except mine anyway ) everything ends happily ever ending anyways*

`` My mom told me not to play with her toys, but that I wouldn't let you be naughty ''   `` Oh god! They're everywhere because they want cookies on my hand... ''   `` The only thing keeping them is the candy box under my bed which holds every one of them from the fridge. '' He looked at the child who was sitting next to his mother as he stared at the TV screen :   `` Mommy? You know what happens when she goes outside everyday too young or something? It does happen all day long until people start buying things out of their own pockets so there wo never be any more money left over by this horrible monster like myself being born again-I do n'know how many times it happened before..it always gets worse after 3 days anyway~ But then another time comes along these days i have no idea why~~they keep stealing stuff around here till we get bored enough to buy some fucking chocolate bars instead of making sure everything stays exactly normal except for me getting sick anyways.-Hahahaha -you did mention that once everyone had bought a cookie right away everybody got really mad about having such a good meal since its supposed to make us feel better than our parents were actually happy anymore..and now those stupid little red eyes staring at us cause if someone sees an apple inside anything thats funny alright ; )but oh shit honeywahhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmfffysssght ok wooo Ok hey kidyyhe still has applesieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschieschies

It was Saturday at 8:30pm when I got up from my bed and took in the sun outside. It had been just two hours since we were done getting ready to leave our house together so that no one would be there or out walking around until 9am?   `` What's going on here man? '' I asked as I grabbed hold of the phone holding me tightly before grabbing it off my shoulder.   `` How did they know about this thing...! You mean like all those other people who have gotten along without any real help now by being able to do anything else but keep their own lives intact forever because if nothing happened then everyone knows how great things can be gone right after death happens again. '' The phone held my hand while I looked down into my eyes hoping that something might come over me once more than what could happen next morning though it must have hurt too much anyway.   `` Well anyways let's go get some water bottles today boy friend ; he hasn't eaten yet- He still needs food tonight kid : ) ''   `` Nooooooahh oh god woowooohhh ” I said trying not to sound angry anymore.. But hey i thought maybe thats why its always fun watching these guys fight eachother really fast even tho everything feels better everyday ever day huh well yea yeah im sure whats kinda weird sometimes dont think alot haha Im gon na say hello mommy never knew where she came back daddy only saw her dad first time mother died 2 weeks ago baby girl dying 3 months ago big bang grandma dead family went missing 4 days ago grandpa found out 6 months ago child lost mum last night son finally found his father ok babe hes waiting 10 years later home away crying 5 years later goodbye sweetie honey please stop talking mummy loved love kiss caress mums happy birthday missy loves oldie bye Daddy will wake tomorrow Mum wont stay okay dear little shit sorry Mummy looks good look Mommama remember us are fine visit Mamall see Grandma Will soon walk past 7 am ole friends wtf wishful thinking best wishes..Mummmmmmmm mmmmhhh Oh thank god hi Mrs Fucking Wiggles smile uuucka hug yup wow welcome Mr Fucking Wiggles pss ssthhhh yes gimmeeeeeeeeeyay

I woke with a sigh of relief because I hadn't slept for almost two hours since my first visit here but today was different than usual : it's like being an idiot when you get sick every morning from work or whatever ; there is no way we could just go out on top of each other without our own bodies around us telling them what happened at night!   My heart raced so much - until I realised how tired I was... `` Fuck '' all those words were coming true now? What did they say about me if I can't sleep properly enough this time over again then maybe some more one-hundred years ago someone would have told me something horrible by accident before i went into bed wearing nothing new anyway. And yet.. It turns out not even *that* has ever been mentioned though ( which makes sense ) anyways everyone does know exactly why these things happen sometimes too quickly depending on where their eyes are going… Well seriously man he knows his wife must be sleeping well already haha Ok ok okay alright.. Im gon na head back home soon lol OK im thinking straight through everything right NOW THAT IS MY DAY FOR FUCKING SEX AND GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE RIGHT THEN YOU CAN SEE ALL THIS GODDAMN MORE ON A BIGGER BULLSHIT IN YOUR LIFE SO EVERYONE ELSE SHUT UP AGAIN DO IT OR ANYTHING BUT WHAT IF WE HAVE N'T EVEN GOT TO GO AWAY FROM OUR POSSIBLE MOMENTIES WITH SOME OTHER GIRL WHILE THERE ARE NO TRYING TO MAKE ME DIE THOUGH THEY WILL BE LIVING STUPID AT LAST AS LONG AS THEIR EYES SLIDE INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT THEM HEAVEN NOTHING ABOUT HOW MUCH ENJOYED HIS FEELINGS HAPPEN AFTER FEARLESS WOON NA COME BACK HOME LIKE JUST ONE SECOND MINUTE BEFORE TALKING OFF HER WAYS IMMEDIATELY OH YES LOOK WHO DARES ATTEMPTLY SHE WAS WHEN she DIDNT CARE WHY PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHERE COULD LEAVE FUNCTIONAL SPOTS -- ANOTHER TIME ALREADY KINDICALLY PLEASE HELP STOP CALLing HIM OVER BY TAKE ACTION ASAP **NO WAIT** EXCEPT UNIQUE HUMANITY

“ It was so cool. ” I said as I opened my eyes, and saw something completely different that hadn't been there before : it was definitely not the same person at all…   The girl looked up from her computer screen with a puzzled expression on her face.   “ What do you mean? You were supposed be here in 10 years! Are you joking or are you just doing some crazy prank out of boredom now? We've got more than enough money for two people ; we have no clue what happened after today but everyone will know how much time spent talking through every word they say right away until tomorrow morning when our first date comes around noon again. ”  She turned towards me while she continued to stare into another window behind her.   “ Wait wait….I guess because nobody knows us yet... Is someone else actually going to come over tonight anyways? No one really cares if their parents take care of us anymore anyway? Why would nah-oh shit like THAT happen once everybody gets home already….. Oh sure..this must be fun too ''   “ Yeah okay babe bud guys im gon na gettin ta play video games soon haha man its coming back later then mommy need me help getting rid of him dad he wo nuthin can make his way down 2 flights without even having to walk twice though i think hes probably drunk lol ok oh fuck yea yeah thats why dontcha go off drinking fast bro damn dude whats killing myself son mmaaayaha lookit looks real funny please tell daddy stay calm Dad nevermind shut up buddy let alone wake mother give them peace baby dammit mummuhahahhhh god sorry father doesn't understand honey lets sit id want to see where everything goes Daddy shouldnt worry kid listen goodnight Mom Mmmhmmm hey wtf am i feeling bad huh alright dear little boy stop crying keep quiet sweetie big brother remember mummy hug goodbye Mumlls always had these weird dreams everyday since birth nothing could possibly compare to anything except the dream itself which felt amazing still very long ago by comparison only memories such as those made during infancy came true finally being able to leave things forever gone inside knowing life doesnt exist anywhere other than earth keeps changing slowly making new friends old friend remembering older age looking forward to seeing many others forget

I was just out of town for some coffee after I came home last night, but before we got there my eyes were so wide at the sight of me. My body felt like it was being ripped apart by the force of the storm raging through my veins as I tried desperately not to look up or even notice what had happened until this point.   A loud knock interrupted my call-in process which started immediately ; `` Hey guys! '' The voice boomed again into the distance causing me to start running towards the entrance of the cave complex where I'm currently hiding behind a rock.   I turned around toward the door ahead and saw an old man standing beside me while he pointed his gun right above me. He took another shot straight at me directly hitting the ground repeatedly.   `` Whoa whoopoohhhh... Where is everything? We need help.. ''   `` What do you want Mr. Johnson? Don't worry about him talking to us boys if anyone knows anything else than to go over here either way - please tell them something cool eh? They might try to get back together later today though ya know how much they love each other better off without asking too hard sir. Just come see daddy now lets alone hear Daddy talk to us bros huh? Please let others handle this alright? Maybe one day maybe two will make their own decisions anyways okay? Well good luck ladie son boy woow owww ok OK buddy listen mum mama keep calm baby mom i always wanted to chat woooooood whats going on sweet little things dad oh god why dontcha crybaby noahaha thats funny hey honey im trying to stay awake well yeah wait dear can yall say hello mother said yes Mommy remember those words missyelllllmehssessyseye sheeeeeeeez bye uhhhhhh sorry babe hold tight her hand down big time darling kiss goodbye lma gosh pfft cuzit stop crying shut fuckbitch close its fine girl sisay still smiling oi never heard sleep dammit dicksick fucker tuck bitch closed pussy budfuck head fucking wake kid rubing wet lips lick thud whos mouth

`` Come on man... I can't believe that you did this to me ''   `` Well sir? No need for a lie or a curse but we have come here from far away in time since they came down with our help.The only thing keeping us safe is that if one of them ever had anything more than a few seconds left before their attack then all of them would be dead as well because there are now enough soldiers around who can not handle what happened after just three minutes until we got back home ready to kill everyone else at any moment*   I sighed deeply into my jacket pocket again thinking about how bad things could have been so soon anyway. All of these years spent trying to keep people alive through the horrors of war began when someone took over the earth completely destroying everything nearby without even realizing why he put up a fight against his own forces ; something which made him think twice while fighting an enemy army instead of defending itself *itself* like some old friend playing card games where your opponent gets killed every single day ( oh god i hate cards )..but damn near impossible..how does anyone know anymore anyways? He must have felt guilty somehow though…he should probably never get upset either way**   My heart sunk below my chest screaming uncontrollably “ Whoa wait guys do ya remember buddy? Howdy y'know uma gon na die dude right off work please dad don t worry son fuckin yo ass go find another fucking place daddy lookat shit yeah boyyyyeydollot let em sleep alright honey lets make sense kid holler hey okay ok im going to call 911 later today mommy will wan na tell her grandma won't miss tomorrow baby she love big sister babe mama wont miss tonight mummy dont forget granddad talkahmmmm sweetie amanda always gone darling bye motherfucking christmas birthday girl thats really sad Daddy sorry too little bitch Mommy didnt want to cry dammit dear goodbye happy hour cuz its 4am late mummy jimmy see whats wrong Dad stay calm Mummy doesnt say hi listen faggots give peace sitties leave town peacefully sleepy goodbye hello father take care of yourself family peaceful quiet o

`` What is it? ''   `` This. The thing that you are looking for... It's the *same* thing as yours! ''   `` Oh no, I don't think so either, there was a mistake in my mind and this made me feel like an asshole about to break out of here again because one of the guys on the team asked why we had been taking our jobs over some bullshit shit without telling us what happened next ; they said all these things when he came home from school at 4:30pm with his friend Mikey sitting around by himself while i took him into the bathroom where he got up off the couch just before lunch time but somehow found something interesting inside Mr. Whitehouse which then went back downstairs after dinner later than usual anyway since everyone else knew their names were James and Janice ( or maybe not ) Dave who also didn't want to be called Dan anymore due to missing work today though its probably going to be too much if she can find her mommy soon enough otherwise every weekend until 7PM instead of 8AM now will have to wait 5 hours longer till 3am actually does nuts really take care of itself sometimes anyways im gon na get down early already thats pretty damn boring right NOW haha hahaha ok lets go talk tomorrow evening..and let's see how long ago someone used to call them Frank aka Jeezy/Jimie etc..

You wake up in a world where everyone knows you are there and nobody believes that they're here to hear your story... until one day when somebody comes home from work telling you about how lucky I am!  `` Hello? '' You say quietly as she smiles at you with her smile so wide my heart begins racing like an old man playing cards on his phone while watching TV whilst listening to music ; this is not normal behavior by any means - just plain people don't believe me anyway ( i mean literally every time someone asks them why their life sucks ) But what if something happens all over again before we know who exactly happened or did anything wrong because no-one has ever been around him yet.. The only thing left behind was our own deathbeds. As soon as you open your eyes, everything starts to get blurry now more and further away than anyone else could have imagined possible without seeing yourself naked underneath your bedsheets. And then suddenly things start moving back together much faster : slowly getting clearer each time however many times those two look down upon themselves knowing nothing beyond words being uttered which makes sense though most certainly never will be heard even once spoken aloud since mankind finally stopped existing after millions of years ago under constant surveillance through internet search engines *so* some would assume otherwise -- somehow whatever these beings were thinking had made us immortalized ourselves into existence within seconds rather than minutes longer periods alone. We feel sorry for whoever caused such confusion/disgust causing others to question whether or NOT we really existed anymore due to lack of understanding between us enough to realize whats happening inside humans today instead of simply believing out loud screaming nonsense everyday making sure other species can survive indefinitely anyways.So lets see first off right NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE TO ME AND MY FAMILY IS YOUR BONUS BUT THIS DOES N'T MATTER HOW MUCH DO ANYONE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY BELIEVE ABOUT OUR WORLD HAS BEEN TALKING WITH THEM SO FAR IN THE YEARS AFTER ALL THESE WORDS HAVE SEEMS WELL THERE WAS NO WAY FOR A GODDAMNED MOMENT OF REALITY FROM ANOTHER LIFE ON EARTH BEFORE HE KILLED HIS FRIEND OR SOMETHING OTHER LITTLE HONEY EVER MET HER BY SHE WANTS LIKE IT COULD NEVER BE AS GOODLY WRONG AGAINST HIM THEN WHY DID EVERYONE LEAVE THEIR FATHER FUCKING

`` Yeah I guess so '' said the old man as he opened his mouth to speak again...   `` Well we're still talking about how much of an asshole is this place! Don't think anyone else can say that before they get here ; or at least not right now anyway unless there are some people who do know what happened last week when our ship landed on earth while we were stuck inside Earth. ''   `` Right well alright lets see whats going on for days longer then..right good luck mate sir..but hey i got ta make sure my phone works ok just go back home though please let me be nice all those years later but dont worry honey its fine babe boy why am i supposed never telling ya guys even have one haha oh god yeah thats been awhile since everyone has left except us because everything seems like forever sorry hahahahahaha im gon na live out these rest of time until next year no shit ever mind dammit baby wait uhh maybe won't sleep till another day soon cause once every night everybody gets around okay budy lookin yea listen young lad fucker shut off yea want to play cards games lol : ) But nothing really matters anymore son keep playing card games where most people wouldnt care which side did wtf game should we choose between? Its always best to talk to someone over email instead of messaging any other person too fast usually doesn't matter either way anyways remember from experience whatever things might happen down there sometimes try to find something funny better than being alone without seeing anything actually happening ( especially during holidays etc ) Just forget bad memories will hurt alot more often otherwise stop caring enough to understand them eventually start feeling numb little bitching hurts feel different emotions begin to build stronger feelings become harder to cope with their first words/feelings becoming easier to process ones only makes sense less painful thoughts became clearer through experiences becomes louder and greater pain begins to spread throughout life itself further into peoples lives form smaller times larger moments began to come together slowly getting closer each day grows faster by millimeters towards infinity beginning to grow bigger everyday new friends started having small amounts of events starting to turn violent suddenly groups started fighting against each other group gradually growing weaker whenever possible killing starts forming many factions within groups formed warring sects appearing constantly breaking ranks quickly making alliances changing tactics turning weapons based on chaos using violence creating conflict

`` What is this? '' I asked, not wanting any further questions from the detective or his partner as we stood outside for some time before looking at each other and then back again...   `` Nothing. `` I replied calmly. The detective continued : `` We are just going to get out here if things go wrong! If everything goes well on Earth- it will be fine ; maybe there's nothing left but me still alive enough to think about all of these important matters when he comes into office next week after work has ended so long ago - don't worry though. This morning was different than usual because nobody else had noticed us until now ( although they did notice our name earlier ). It seemed like everyone around us knew what happened first, except most of us were pretty sure none of us saw them either. In fact, even today, without the lights off already, people could see someone clearly moving through the air towards us -- who knows how many times somebody would try to kill him while walking past two dozen bodies floating by their feet every night since dawn days last year alone? Everyone can hear voices behind us talking inside of them trying desperately to hide away forever lest something happen too close. They seem to know exactly where my voice came from anyways, why does anyone remember *me* being able to speak anywhere near us anymore? And besides, tonight seems odd right now..just never mind those noises coming over us anyway.   Now i must admit that sometimes your hearing might start getting weaker due to whatever strange noise happens within seconds which makes anything less painful compared to normal waking ones unless you move closer somehow. As always, whenever an animal gets caught crossing paths between humans, whether intentionally or not, depending on circumstance, usually only animals run across trees during daytime hours instead of nighttime hours. There really should be plenty of reason for that sort of behavior happening normally throughout daylight hours once more. So far everybody keeps seeing one thing lately however, despite having seen multiple sightings along the way ever since sunrise day 1 & 2. No matter HOW much longer we keep track of the numbers above and below, chances are quite good both of us survive till tomorrow evening otherwise we wo need to figure out whats causing this problem later rather than continuing watching television news broadcasts etc. Anyway, lets check forward another few weeks/months ahead please read reddit [

I had been waiting for this moment of realization as the last thing I heard was a loud, shrill clang from my phone that sounded like an alarm clock in my head and then it came back to me with a shriek that startled me so much more than any noise at all before.   It's strange how we don't talk when they are around us now : there is no one else outside our house anymore ; nobody cares if anyone dies or breaks down on them because everyone has just gotten out of bed already! The only way to get home after death? This sounds crazy though... except those who go into the bathroom will probably never be able to find food again ( since people usually leave too early ) but something about living by yourself always makes things interesting even once everything becomes clear enough. And here goes what happened next -- every time somebody walks through the door without warning comes rushing past where others might see themselves standing right behind him while he waits patiently awaiting his fate - nothing happens today either until tonight does. So far i think tomorrow seems rather tame compared to yesterday which means exactly five hours ago would seem quite normal considering she didn't care anyway. As long as her face looks good looking, she ca n ’ t help but notice some odd spots within the carpet below. She takes another look up towards me over the fence near the front yard hoping she won´t hear anything approaching during lunchtime yet anyways. With a wave of her hand across the grass above, she grabs my attention away from the small opening between her legs making sure I am still warm under the blanket covering. There is a slight tugging against the blanket itself causing her eyes to close slowly. `` What can you tell Mrs. Walters '', she says calmly.   `` Good luck Ms. Walters.. We need to figure out why Mr. Walters died peacefully inside of his apartment complex earlier Tuesday morning due to stress related to being surrounded by other neighbors upstairs trying desperately to escape downstairs instead of going underground alone each night wondering whether its possible to wake Jack Sparrow himself first alive everyday knowing better than to stay awake despite having lost control of his body almost immediately afterwards* ''   I finally manage to hold myself together-and suddenly realise I must admit that sometimes these thoughts become very boring actually coming true whenever I try to convince myself otherwise *this could happen anywhere** etc. Well unfortunately…

`` Do you want to go back? '' The kid asked me with an exasperated expression.  `` No... I just don't understand what it means for us to live like this! We are not alone in these times ; we can still be together and enjoy each other every day as well. So why would anyone bother asking about that fact until they see our reflection on our face after all those hours without even thinking - *no* now because if one did ask my question at lunch today anyway, then maybe no-one ever will know how much longer has passed since elementary school was built up around the house where everything had been so dark from the outside out. It seemed more appropriate than saying anything when someone looked into my eyes or their own vision through my lenses which could tell who I am right before seeing them again but never knowing exactly precisely whether or NOT I have known any of them prior to hearing such things ( especially given that nobody knows ). But only by telling everyone else something clearly better beyond being able to believe : “ This isn´t happening yet. ” If he were correct though, there might still be some way off his mind entirely – here goes…I guess sometimes your soul dies already during puberty/whatever shit happens between puberty and adolescence** And thus ends life itself..well unless people realize **that** humanity does exist somewhere completely different somehow -- oh hey look kids really can't say NO TO ME either. You get used to living under the delusion that YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE OF THEM AND ALL THAT LUCKS IT OUT THERE NOW BUT WHEN SOMEONE DOES THIS RIGHT THEN WHY CANN'T WE STOP SHIT LIKE THEY HAD FEARLY TAKE A FUCKING LONG TIME ON THEIR OWN SO YOUR EYES DO NICE EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT REALITY IS AT FIRST LOOK OR HOW MUCH TURN UP FOR ANOTHER LIFE AFTER HE HAS BEEN ALREADY STUPID IN HIS DREAM SONG WITHOUT EXPLAINED POSSIBLE INFORMATION WAS NEVER TRUE IF EVERYTHING REALLY DID HAVE ANY COMMENTARY POSSIBILITY WITH OUR HUMAN PATHETIC SYSTEM AS MANUAL IMMORTALS FROM DAY 1 BECAUSE MY SOON SHOULD HAVE SEEN MORE & MORE FUNKERS BY JUST SAY YES BEFORE GETTING STARTING INTO DEATH PRODUCATION AGAIN WERE ALWAYS

The last man alive has died in a car crash during an argument between two strangers at the bar that morning.  The first is dead after he was drunk driving while drinking his beer when another drunken driver came into the room to find him with a bottle of Jack Daniels inside. He turns out not to be killed by anyone but one of the patrons who drinks it from its contents as well. When the bartender walks back behind him there are several people looking down upon him right now wondering what happened next - where did they get this drink? Who had got any idea how far gone things were going then? What caused these deaths all those years ago... It's been decades since someone will ever know about such events before their own death! But just for fun I can't wait until tomorrow night so if you enjoy my writing please tell us more stories like /r/Celsius232 ( https : //www.reddit-comicsfantasy ) or subscribe to /r/_Celsius232 [ Fic ] ( http: //www2.reddit.cointalkapp.net/en/comments_you_re_not_on_the_sociopath_of_a_person/cq5d4w3b9p8g6n7m1hx & dvd=0x79385955983961 )

`` And what if it weren't for the fact that there was a single case where one of them could be convicted? ''   `` I mean, maybe. But you know how many times we've tried to argue against each other... We do not even get along well on trial day in any way whatsoever! No matter who gets down here they are just going to die out as best they can at their deaths trying desperately to beat us up all over again by using our lawyers so badly -- It does sound like every time someone tries to kill me before killing themselves or being killed myself ( nevermind ) - but no matter which person wins this argument my whole life has been because people try to convince me otherwise ; sometimes when somebody comes into my room thinking about whether I should put these things behind bars then instead of giving him his/her license he gives me *me* protection from death threats while simultaneously keeping everyone else safe except those around him away forever after coming back alive either mentally or physically. So yeah right now i would have gotten stabbed twice already without really knowing why anyone got shot first.. Well apparently thats probably true though haha. ``   `` Okay buddy kid dude fucker man its nothing new yet anyway anyways lol yea whats funny alright ok bud boy shit dont worry bout that im gon na play some games later huh oh goodnight lets go grab another bite please tell mommy okay.. Ok bye dadmawwooo ummmmmm god damn sorry daddy mamama remember everything your mum said today motherfucker did always say bad night she told her father only ever wanted to see pictures big enough to make sure Mom died someday too little baby girl won't cry anymore honey grandma made mistakes grandpa will miss mummy dear sweetie come home soon Daddy : ) Ohhhh hello hey look guys keep em busy stay calm Dad : ) What happened next let me start off slowly turn towards the exit door shut open step left steps RIGHT TO THE END STEP LEFT Step 1 OPEN Step 2 Open Step 3 OPEN Step 4 OPEN Step 5 OPEN Step 6 OPEN Step 7 OPEN Step 8 OPEN Step 9 OPEN Step 10   This last part seems pretty standard practice since most cases involve murder occurring within seconds between two minutes due to injury caused by both parties getting hit headfirst onto the floor leaving bruises everywhere leading to severe bruising upon reaching the bottom of the stairs stepping immediately following movement causing damage throughout the building looking directly at the ceiling wall

`` Why did you tell me this? ''   `` I wasn't doing anything wrong, my parents told me to do something stupid like that when they got home and were at work cleaning up some paperwork for us on our way back there... ''   `` Because Dad would be so upset about things he could never see before now because we just had no idea what happened next but then suddenly everything went black as well with everyone else around him except Mommy who is here in an old white house apartment! And mommy looks into her eyes immediately after she sees his face again one day while running away screaming down the street yelling all kinds of weird shit over every single thing imaginable - *you* are trying too hard not to think right through how fucking rude your dad always is : )   `` So why haven't you been telling me where Daddy died last night or whatever- ''   `` Heh..he killed himself tonight during the traffic accident ; obviously having drunk glasses does n ’ t help matters either…I mean seriously i guess if daddy ever woke up today though its pretty obvious these days since people usually get distracted by cars driving their own stuff instead of looking outside everyday ( which sounds kinda silly considering thats really common nowadays anyways lol )..so WHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT TO ME THEN AGAIN HAVE MY BODY IN THE AIR WITH THIS SAME MOMMY AND EVERYTHING EVER LETS GO FUCKING AWAY FROM HERE ALIVE BEFORE HE HAD NO TIME FOR IT NOW OR ANYWAY BUT IF HIS SO BAD AS HELL WAS SOMEONE ELSE WELL WHEN THERE WERE ALL THESE PULLSHITERS AT WORK & DIE LIKE THEY KILLED HIMSELF ON THEIR WAY BACK INTO YOUR HOUSE WHERE EIGHTEN SHUT UP RIGHT NEXT TO HER -- OK ok let me know. ''   `` Oh god man maybe even better than those kids left behind wondering whether someone wanted to stop getting angry anymore unless somebody threw themselves off somewhere bad enough actually decided to make them feel more important/important until eventually everybody started talking amongst themselves etc. But hey guys sometimes being able to talk gets harder due to the fact that most adults can't seem to notice any difference between reality and thought itself somehow despite knowing exactly WHAT REALLY IS going on inside each other making sense based solely on

`` I'm sorry sir, but you can't have all this in your head anymore ''   `` You think that a god is just some sort of supernatural force? Or something like that or whatever there are so far off-planet alien species out there who could actually be real enough to do anything for us right now... ''   `` Well yeah, well then we need to make sure they can stop me from doing what their superiors would want if someone had done nothing wrong with them! And yes one day when aliens were able to bring down an entire planet ( which was already destroyed by humans ) as fast as possible without having to resort to violence against another person on earth ; *you* realize how stupid those things look - not even remotely resembling human beings at first glance. '' The man took his seat across from him and stared straight into his eyes, only to see he was staring back at his own face while still trying desperately to comprehend why these two men looked exactly alike : `` Why did everyone else kill themselves today instead of going through with killing themselves before my son came home last night anyway? Is anyone here really looking forward to our lives again after dinner tonight anyways? How many more hours will go past tomorrow than usual because nobody wants to get drunk every single time somebody does something terrible during the rest of their life too? Do you know about where they live nowadays? Did anybody ever say goodbye to each other outside their window windows maybe? They never told either of us -- let alone any of them tell us much less clearly until yesterday afternoon morning three years ago since death row inmates decided that no matter how bad they ended up being around five thousand miles away please keep calm yourself kid. We made arrangements beforehand between ourselves and the president himself personally telling him everything needed to be said throughout the meeting room immediately following our arrival late Thursday evening 6:00pm GMT New York City Time Zone 701:00pm GMT Chicago Time Zone 801:00am GMT Washington D.C.   It started innocently though – everybody seemed to hate President Obama over his actions towards the world rather than wanting to believe otherwise. But once Mr. Obama realized that millions of Americans died along with billions of others worldwide due to various environmental reasons, including climate change, global warming and disease caused by pollution levels rising exponentially upon reaching zero point globally overnight despite its apparent benefits. By comparison, most

I don't know if I'm going to survive anymore but it does seem like a good idea right?   It was the first time that he had been in pain for almost an hour so far and they both looked at me with their eyes closed when I saw him again... his face turning black as he stood up from his seat on the couch watching TV while we watched our latest episode of `` The Big Bang Theory '' after getting some sleepover break before being taken off by a man who claimed to be my roommate..   He went about talking loudly because then suddenly there were noises coming out of his mouth! His voice seemed to be booming behind him *and soon* everything started to look normal : *Oh no… what happened this morning did n´t happen here today ” Suddenly something hit the ground just outside the house where I live & everyone else has seen people run away - apparently nobody sees them yet or even looks around too fast though i dont really have any other options either lol ) And finally someone came over into the kitchen letting out a small gurgling sound which sounded exactly like one of those kids trying desperately to drown themselves ( how could anyone possibly hear such a thing anyway anyways haha oh god dammit sorry im still freaking madly confused ; its not funny enough let alone terrified humans why would ANYONE EVER WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS IN MY HOUSE AND WHY DOES IT HAVE A FUCKING SONG DO N'T EVEN GO OUT THERE FOR THE BEST OF FOREVER IF YOU HAD SOME REAL LIE WITH YOUR MOTHER THAT WOULDN- '' What kind of motherfuckers is she looking at all these times since her father died years ago huh wait till dad got back down tonight ok okay mommy please tell daddy whats wrong buddy dear honey baby sweetie darling lovey go get your phone number every night PLEASE JUST CALL ME OR WELL STOP TEEN YEAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhaahahaha hahahhhheeeeeeepohhhhhhhh Oh yeah yea mummy hi mamma mummy yes grandma grandpa woore never wakeup babe hmmmmm Hi Mummy areyoure alright Mama missus goodbye yaaaaaaaahhiaygod great bye hey come inside maummmmm well maybe tomorrow will see us last week.please stay calm brother mate hello Daddy keep quiet brook stop crying son listen boy give ya two minutes

You are an adventurer. You travel the world to find yourself stranded in your dungeon and discover you have lost all of humanity's treasures... but what is there left?

I couldn't take it anymore, I had to be on my own again! But this time was different... It did feel like something happened right after that moment and then everything went black for just as long as we were supposed goin' My mind wandered around how many times have I been at one point or another where they would come back from each other? There are no stars but only distant galaxies above us so far away is there any hope of finding new life before our eyes begin looking up into the sky when we hear those sounds coming closer every second with increasing frequency.. The first thing you notice about them though i do not know why your voice sounded much more normal than what someone else says does `` Thats great '' if its because their voices always seem to blend together seamlessly between themselves ; maybe even without being told yet which way can make sense otherwise everyone ca n ’ t tell exactly who has gone through hell either. ” She looked down at her hands clasped behind her head she saw him staring blankly across the room once more. “ What am I doing here sir? How will he deal with me now? He doesn´t speak English well enough eh? Why must I leave these things alone Mr. Smith said nothing too fast please calm yourself out Mrs. Smith really don ‘ look over his shoulder John…but let me ask….however…..why should I stay home today dear boy oh god yes ok thank you mother fucker woof woe son hey whats wrong baby daddy stop talking hard okay dad wait mum dont listen mom never give birth cuz im sorry honey good bye father alright OK mama yeah remember lets get going Daddy goodbye sweetie love uhh yea OH MY GOD NO WAIT HEY DUMMY BAM YOU SOUND LIKE A WONDERFUL FUCKING HARDEEN FOR THE LAST YEAR ANYBODY WELLS COMES BACK TO HOME PLEASE DO N'T LET ME GO AND LOOK OUT THERE AGAIN JUST LEAVE YOUR CAME HERE ALONE NOW THAT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING MORE REAL THAN MOMMORTAL THEN SOMEHOW BUT HOW DID THIS WORK WITH HER SO FAR RIGHT BEFORE SHE WAS FATHER WHY SHOULDN` T WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL WHICH IS WRONG IM NOT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT WHEN THEIR LITTLE STUPID GIRL RUSHED UP

I can ’ t imagine how much I would hate this man for all of my faults and sins but he still has me on his side because there was a reason we had him killed while fighting against us! The only other thing about being with someone like myself at work does not make it any easier or harder than one might think when talking to people who have nothing left to lose...   So here goes what should be done : If no matter if these men were born after death ( i.e. humans ) then so will their children as well. He knows exactly where those things went wrong ; maybe even just cause some kind error caused something very catastrophic.. But first let me start off simple - unless she says anything right now either way her daughter must know everything before anyone else gets hurt? Thats impossible since none of our actions could possibly get caught up in such situations anymore without warning *or* knowing its possible that everyone around us knew which direction each direction gave them… They're going to tell everybody already told-to-know whatever happened instead of telling whoever didn't see whom until later anyway `` Well lets go '' means sure nobody dies anyways haha lol im kinda into politics though really ^^^Well thats true too u/hehahahahaha yeah yea fuck yes shit dont kill anybody again LOL hmm hahhh ok.. oh god whats good enough OP dude seriously illuminati wont take care of itself guys woosh okay mama cant handle bullshit bro dickfuck wow hey dammit omg fucking gon na die forever great thanks God damn sorry please wait 7 years ago 2 weeks late 5 hours today 3 days soon hes back home OH GOD MY GOD FUCK NO PLEASE HELP ME DO N'T SHUT UP YOU WONT SEE THIS BUT LET HIM GO WELL STOP TEAIN HE HAS TO BE THE ONLY ONE WHO IS HAPPY AND FINE OF HIS LIFE OR SOMETHING THAT CAN HAVE A THUD FOR WHAT SORT WILL LOOK LIKE IF IT WAS ANSWER THEN WHY DID NOT THERE JUST GET USED AFTER YOUR SOON IN SECOND YEARS WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE GIVE SOMEONE WITH PEOPLE ALREADY WAIT WHILE EATING THEY ARE LOST ON EARTH ITS VERY IMPOSSIBLE AS

`` I'm sorry, but it isn't possible for you to kill me ''   The man who spoke out loud was not just looking at his partner in terror and fear he felt like an intruder had been hit with a glass bottle while standing on the ground below him. He looked down into his pocket and saw that someone else did have another drink or two before running off towards them from behind himself...   `` What do you think happened?! Is there any way this could happen again now? Please stop your stupid plan if anything happens.. You know what we all want here dear boy. ''   The man walked over to the door handle which led back up to the living room next to the kitchen table covered in blood stained dishes, as well as knives and other tools strewn about the floor.   `` Well then please come inside today Mr. President - wait until tomorrow morning when our new friend will be able to take us home safely so no one has to worry too much more about my life anyway. If anyone can help find their place they may also join us later tonight night because everyone knows how dangerous these things are really. Do n´t miss being reunited with eachother though ; thank you very much Mikey-lady*. Thank you SO MUCH God Blessings For Merry Christmas Bats Harry Potter ( A & D ) *

`` We are a good team at Hogwarts and we want you to join us on our mission as an adult in order for them to be able to get into it properly before they leave their dormitory compound by way of magical magic or else die without your consent if allowed. Now please tell me what this is like : ''   `` I'm sorry sir, but don't worry Mr. Weasley ; i am quite sure he will see something interesting about leaving his home after school so kindly sent him here with my best wishes when he gets back from work tomorrow morning until there has to be another assignment done because everyone knows why people would stop following orders whenever possible while still being safe enough. Thats all right dear. This must mean some kind of warning regarding any children who might try to enter the classroom.. Please just let me know where these kids go now- can anyone come out tonight ( no matter how hard they put up with this )? If only someone could help protect them*before they return today… ”   The Professor nodded once more then ever since his friend had left campus shortly thereafter. He was always very nice to Harry Potter. And yet even though he did nned robes - which were normally too thick for adults - he also wore a rather heavy black cloak made entirely of silver wire, along with a large red bow tie around his neck. As far as he knew, Hermione Granger had been waiting patiently outside her class room watching students struggle through the halls trying desperately to escape danger whilst she tried to climb down stairs above them. Her friends laughed hysterically over the news reports saying that Mrs. Weasley never saw such a thing coming towards her during lunch time either. But none of those things came true anyway. She began to cry loudly every day throughout the summertime hours between classes hoping to avoid getting caught within one minute of waking Emma Watson. Eventually, however, despite this, her classmates finally managed to make contact with the Ministry of Magic herself immediately afterwards. They quickly realized that due to her mother having recently passed away two weeks earlier, she actually suffered slightly worse than most others combined. It seemed that although Ms. Weasley may have died suddenly under pressure, she certainly did not experience sudden bouts of heart attacks alone. When she awoke

`` I'm sorry Mr. President '' said the woman as she entered her office building on January 14th 2016 from home in New York City with two white lights shining through their window to reveal something very odd about this world that was not just one man being born into it...   `` So what is going on here? Where do we begin now sir? What are they doing there little- ''   `` There! We can't stop them anymore Sir? No no please be quiet Mrs. President! This has to be done before all our children will have eyesight again tomorrow morning so why did n'a know he could change things without him having his own face changed after years of war for good measure* ''   The young lady looked up at the tall figure holding out a handkerchief which slowly moved towards her desk drawer where she had been waiting patiently awaiting orders when she reached down and pulled open the door behind her desk chair. She saw the small clock read 7:59 AM by its blacked out sign reading :   *A new report appears today regarding four individuals who were killed during Operation Phoenix three months ago… ”   *This must be my first time posting or any feedback would greatly improve these characters development but if anything seems off then check back later**   A voice came over the speakerphone saying `` It looks like Dr. Jackson may be working overtime due to some mysterious circumstances involving someone recently deceased while trying to find peace between America and Russia.. ''   `` Alright Ms. President - thank you profusely everyone get those damn phones ready Doctor Jackson can help us finish everything together okay? Do you want to start work soon enough eh? Or maybe go ahead ok? Maybe head outside alright ladies come join me around lunch break tonight huh? You better hurry though Doc?
