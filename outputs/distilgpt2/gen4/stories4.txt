As I was walking home from work, my boss asked me if he could tell the story behind it all!   `` No no '' said the voice in the other line.   `` Yes sir... well you can see what's happening with that movie? What is this really about? The reason we were hired as consultants today seems like something out of the blue.I can't think of any good ideas right now but let's just say there are some things here- do they have more than one thing left or another? That does seem so outlandish given the number of people working at Apple who has been tasked with creating their own product based off of various companies such Asimov's classics ( A Space Odyssey 2 ) and others ( Hocus Pocus 4:50 - Part One # 5 / *Pawnstar* + Wreckage & Flow ; not quite sure which ones had better stories then mine personally haha ). Now everyone else knows where our company came up with these little tidbits because when someone asks them how many hours ago she says half a billion dollars before saying only 1 % instead of 100 % her total savings went towards building every computer within its lifetime except for those numbers actually being taken away again.. Well fucker maybe even less since i know why anyone would ever want to hear us talking anymore anyways lol   So while getting ready for bed next to my desk looking down at my hands shaking uncontrollably whilst staring at my screen waiting for response time till dawn after noon tomorrow morning without having to leave until midnight.. My job title means nothing anyway huh hahahahaha thats great alright ok guys eh hey lets get back into your game buddy please dont worry dude come over ya wont be late im gon na try to play video games too much already okay wait til nighttime woahhh oh god sorry man thanks u/a_boyfriend [ WP ] You should probably check reddit first though later ^^oh yeah yea wow Yeah boy did ask shit yes **yeah lookin ill also read _that._you** must stay awake sleep OH GOD WHY AM YOU HERE TO THIS FUCKING GAME NO COME AWAY AND GET BACK INTO YOUR SON OF THE MOMENTUCKER OR SOMETHING IN THAT WAY WHAT DID IT

*A world where everyone is born with a gift, and no one dies before they are 18... *   I'm sitting on a bench at my house now looking over at it for some time after all this nonsense about how people die every day! How many lives have been saved by us? It seems like we only had three weeks to live out of that curse until our children were allowed to do so again or else their parents wouldn't be able to come back alive when they died because of them being born prematurely ( ) but then suddenly everything changed forever -- except me. My wife was pregnant right up there while she was stillborn ; her child just did n ’ t feel safe anymore as well. She didn´t even know what to expect from her newborn baby girl though : she never spoke any words during those six months long pregnancy which led to her going into labor twice daily – not once since childhood.I doní músá dólco de la vida por este que alora consejo en el pasado para llaméricas ego segundo y eso mi destués una estudiante.

`` How long have you been doing this? ''   `` For the past five years I've never seen anything like it happen... but at least not for now. It seems my entire life is going to be over if he doesn't stop me from killing everyone who had done so! Every single one of them will die today and tomorrow we all are just beginning to know how far ahead they want us to go before getting there again ; every day until next week or even then their lives wo- ''   `` And do n'cha remember when Dave was first born back on Earth after our mother died while being alive by herself -- which means why did she keep telling him about her parents death anyways? That bitch always told me where daddy got sick too much money out of school because Mom wanted to take away everything else - sometimes dad would call up other kids asking questions anyway right? What happened to mom last night during her funeral ceremony instead of trying to find some way to help people anymore? Why ca n ’ t Daddy give any reason to let himself live forever without giving anyone another chance? Well no Dad ever said goodbye since nobody cares what happens afterwards either. So yeah : ) Do your best to tell someone something bad/unfortunate happening around here rather than letting yourself suffer through grief..and start crying whenever possible knowing nothing more important really matters most things still make sense though haha > **I can only hope i hear better***   * [ edit ] ( http: //www2ndv4.com/wpcontent/-/uploads/2014/03/The_Bloody_Wrecked_Creamer_V1.jpg )

`` Now, you know what? '' I asked myself as I looked down at my clock and realized that this wasn't working out for me but rather...   `` Today is your fifth birthday! Congratulations on getting married to an angel named Satan who has been dating many people since birth.. well yes he does indeed have his own son-in law next month so please make sure we both get our children together ASAP or else if anyone can come see him tonight too. ''   The only sound coming from behind me made me jump back into my seat ; the girl standing there staring at me with her big green eyes stared blankly into mine before turning around once more. She didn't even look up when she said it :   `` Yes dear friend of mine will be taking care of you shortly now because then everyone would like to hear about how awesome they are going to be after all these years anyway. Also today i got another chance to meet some new friends tomorrow night ( maybe just watch Netflix ) - thank you very much God no one cares anymore due to their stupid jokes haha..and here goes…I guess thats why everybody wants to read stories every single day while watching tv anyways its ok huh oh hey mommy always makes fun of us right away dad didnt really believe anything until last week though daddy had mentioned something funny lately actually let's go talk about school again eh hahaha lets not worry shithead Momma still gets ta keep talking goodnight Dad looks great mumma likes to try and show off sometimes im afraid dont ask whats wrong motherma says hi sweetie can't wait till late mistery calls home Mumma comes over soon okay baby man help mummy starts crying everyday alright thanks god sorry miss grandma wan na cry honey Daddy criesbaby darling stay calm sleep sleepy remember goodbye grandpa won't say any words ever mind never wake anytime fast stop dreaming bye Mistery call them old age 5 mins ago 10 minutes ago 11 minutes ago 12 minutes ago 13 minutes ago 14 minutes ago 15 minutes ago 16 minutes ago 17 minutes ago 18 minutes ago 19 minutes ago 20 minutes ago 21 minutes ago 22 minutes ago 23 minutes ago 24 minutes ago 25 minutes ago 26 minutes ago 27 minutes ago 28 minutes ago 29 minutes ago 30 minutes ago 31 minutes ago 32 minutes ago 33 minutes ago 34 minutes ago 35 minutes ago 36 minutes ago 37 minutes ago

The war had come, but not before my eyes were open with tears in my eye as he looked at me from behind him.   `` My dear father? '' He asked quietly. He turned around once more looking into the dark abyss below his feet. `` We don't need to worry about that anymore! The world is ready for us now we are here because there has been no enemy left on this planet ever since our first contact against them. ''   `` Yes sir... '' he said finally placing his hand on my shoulder. `` It seems like they will be able to take advantage of their lack of technology again soon enough if they continue to use its resources wisely so they can make sure that even those who fight might survive under any circumstance other than the current threat would still be safe out there alive through some sorta way by then. They may also become obsolete after having used every available tech necessary to combat such a situation or perhaps using different technologies could give rise to something greater power over the last few years alone without destroying themselves within days. You know what these people think right away when someone calls up theirs just moments ago ; only minutes later did humanity realize how foolish they are being today though… ''   `` Well lets see where everyone goes next- ''   I knew better yet most likely why she kept her voice high above my head : She always wanted to talk about things which made sense too - words spoken often during wars ( *that* ) tended towards conflict rather than peace. When times went very wrong both of us spoke together while arguing constantly until eventually neither agreed to anything except silence each other down to merely saying whatever seemed impossible whilst simultaneously stating everything else entirely off the record regarding time travel/time periods etc. So let's say tonight started well back in December 2015 maybe yesterday should go somewhere between August 15th 2039 and March 25th 2020.. Oh yeah wait god dammit please dont hear anyone talking anyways haha oh yea im going to get pissed i cant stop crying ok Im gon na kill myself tomorrow morning okay thats alright fine Ok calm shit fucker start freaking OUT AGAIN LET ME GO NOW STOP FUCKING HERE WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TELL US THAT THIS WAS NOT A P

You are a child of two, and your mother is an orphanage employee at one of these children's detention centers for adults who haven't been found in their adult lives... until you meet her on trial!   She was never going to get out ; she had left so early that we were almost certain they would not be able escape from this prison by themselves or other prisoners if it came as a surprise to us either. It must have been quite some time ago when our father tried to kill her with his gun but he just killed me anyway because I did n ’ t want to know what happened next after my parents died? We lived together forever like normal people do now, apart from him being there every day while mommy slept… except today though … well maybe tomorrow will see another life again. ”   Her eyes were locked onto mine through tears. The sight of her face seemed like a reflection in the very fabric of her mind which told me how beautiful my mother was still alive despite having no idea where she was anymore. But then something caught my eye : my mother “ You need to go home right away too soon – daddy said all about getting here before bedtime comes over….but please don´t let yourself into any trouble Daddy says goodbye sweetie. ”   That sound changed everything around me ever since last night - suddenly everyone stopped laughing once more.. Even Dad knew better than to tell them why things started happening without even knowing anything else….. My mother stared back at me blankly wondering whether I should leave tonight alone……I thought perhaps someday someone might find comfort inside myself instead. Maybe sometimes somebody could finally make sense… Or rather help cope with losing both of them anyways. Whatever decision made dad always pushed himself aside trying to figure out whatever problems existed between us everyday ( especially those kids ) He wanted to stay strong enough to keep fighting against adversity somehow. And eventually nobody got along much longer thanks to Mommy ignoring him completely. When nothing happens naturally cause tragedy does happen normally causes disaster regardless of circumstance etc.. Just thinking about letting Mother take care of herself doesn**not mean keeping quiet helps ease the pain caused by each loss only making matters worse later.. Because most often times Father tries to save others mentally during childhood such as when he finds love/hate amongst students simply due to lack of emotionless anger towards schoolmates nor doing homework via physical therapy seems to actually bring peace to many young

`` You said I was a good boy! ''   The old man grinned and pointed at the old man with a look of horror in his eyes. `` So you weren't always that bad, huh? How did this happen to me when we met again after our first date on earth? And who are those kids back then? Who do you think they came for us as children anyway? Or maybe it was just some kid from another world or something.. Maybe there is no way out because my parents ca n ’ t have been around since kindergarten yet either. Now if only he could talk about how awesome life really is… Well honestly what happened would be so funny now but right here today i am standing next to him staring at me like a child watching an anime while trying not to notice anything weird happening before all these years pass by.I should say though ; every day has changed drastically lately however which means things change little bit too fast sometimes its still better than never ever getting worse due to being able to keep up with everything else everyday more often even one night actually seems normal ( also thanks for your time ) It had taken countless tries to figure out why everyone loved them both physically and mentally, eventually someone realized their ability to remember exactly where everybody lived lives without worrying much anymore until suddenly people started asking questions instead of answers altogether rather than answer themselves naturally causing havoc among other humans such as myself and others alike- although obviously most believe otherwise im sure thats mostly true anyways especially considering nobody knows whats going on nowadays cause having access to technology does seem very nice - except apparently society can see through human interaction quite clearly enough already let alone any kind of social experiment will work itself off completely instantly once given each person makes contact via email/mail etc. But wait ummmh yea yeah yes please tell yourself : What happens tomorrow morning sometime soonness starts falling apart between us almost immediately starting to turn towards us somehow causes chaos everywhere within seconds whenever somebody notices anyone looking down onto them randomly coming together literally making sense of events quickly leading up to nothing important whatsoever unless they realize whatever happend shortly afterwards *and* start running away somewhere slowly disappearing entirely magically vanishing forever leaving behind two strange patterns appearing upon our faces perfectly forming seemingly similar patterns across different regions of the world over several days prior which led to many instances seeing individuals walking past objects silently following orders directly pointing at each other along the lines of `` stop moving quicky shit

`` I'm just going to be out here in a couple hours, '' she said. `` And if you don't mind me being there for long enough and then we could have some fun!   `` You know what that means? There are people who want to see more stars on earth or something else... but they never did think it would matter anymore because of all these years of work with NASA as an investment bank. '' She paused mid sentence after mid sentence before continuing. `` So how about *you* keep sending astronauts back home from space so soon? It will get worse when Earth is gone forever anyway. But at least one astronaut does nned his spaceship like he always did every day since birth until finally landing safely into orbit without anyone noticing him again. We can only hope their craft stays safe even though nobody notices us coming over later than our new friend left behind by another alien race-in-training team last week alone trying desperately to find answers to questions humans ask them once asked earlier this year during the ISS trip around 20 miles south of Washington DC. Well done folks today was no surprise given my arrival time away where we had landed already looking up north due to the fact that everything looks pretty damn good now except the sky seems to be getting darker each night while everyone has tried to make sure nothing ever happens any longer. Not really anything big either. In case someone finds out too late your guess might run low ; hopefully those aliens somehow figured out why humanity took advantage of technology first - maybe not actually finding intelligent life elsewhere rather than land based resources ( which were apparently much better off ) instead of having to rely entirely on satellite satellites/terraforming equipment such can't seem to happen overnight unless mankind found extraterrestrial intelligence beyond their own solar system using advanced methods : teleportation devices via microwaves through walls made of metal balls created by large magnets placed inside small holes connected to the ground beneath the ground surface causing vibrations caused by magnetic fields within objects built into objects designed to cause vibration waves throughout the universe sent by the planet directly under the surface towards the sun itself creating massive earthquakes occurring faster than light travel outside the atmosphere destroying structures building underground cities resulting in buildings collapsing down upon themselves making huge explosions along the way forcing millions of people to evacuate homes below the ground leaving thousands of dead instantly trapped underneath rubble surrounding buildings quickly following suit. As luck would say, none of that happened yet anyways i decided to go ahead and check reddit regularly asking random

`` I can't be serious, '' the voice continued, `` Why did you come to us? It's not like they do anything special for me! They let your children get away with it because we need them back... but when she comes home from work or something and says no-one will care about her anymore that hurts too much ; just tell mommy how bad things are going on here if there is someone else in this world who can help these kids out so badly. ''   `` She has been crying all night now since last week - maybe even worse than yesterday at school.. We must go find another way around getting our daughter into good health again soon enough after then. The only thing keeping my family safe was finding new ways to treat their sick parents better : drugs which would put some people through a lot of pain by themselves while others were able to cope properly until they could relax more quickly as well. But sometimes those days where doctors tried to make sure everyone stayed healthy seemed to end up becoming less likely to develop dementia afterwards though right before dawn times actually took over everything except for the ones whose brain cells started to become damaged due to an unexpected mutation happening somewhere down the line. People had found cures via genetic manipulation involving cloning humans being genetically modified without any real proof whatsoever. My mother told me what happened once Dr. Crenshaw passed off his body entirely completely overnight -- he got really pretty depressed during his time working late nights doing nothing wrong other than to stare at the screen blankly staring at the screen across from him every day ( sorry ) whenever anyone asked why *I* needed a doctor either way. He died four years ago anyway. Well done Jim.

`` The great apes... ''   I looked around at the two men who had been walking along the same path as me for years now. They were so close and yet they seemed too distant to make a single move towards me or my destination ; but that was impossible because it is far from our own home today. Our planet hasn't changed since those days : all life on this world must have died before humans could even begin living again without them knowing what happened next. Humans are still alive here – with no doubt about it. But how do you know? How did things go when their mother left Earth after her death? What if she's gone right back into its orbit over there? We can only hope until someone finds out! There will be an end to this cruel existence forevermore than ever - mankind needs to find another way to survive through such destruction. And then one day humanity discovers something extraordinary beyond ourselves.. It turns up on Mars -- once made habitable by humans alone. A large chunk of the landmass contains hundreds more worlds ( most of which contain many species ) while millions of other planets orbiting the star itself share similar environments. One million people inhabit these new areas every year where billions of different races form colonies across the galaxy together. This means thousands of generations would need to travel further distances each time between the two continents simultaneously.   All of these wonders await some human sacrifice somewhere else entirely, not just space-time though. My journey began several hundred thousand years ago simply being able to see nothing less fascinating anymore despite having never seen anything like this anywhere near our home. If anyone asked why everything felt strange enough, none said much either. So long as everybody knows exactly whose place they lived, everyone knew whatever reason he chose to stay away from his family…and let him walk off down the road maybe ten times longer somehow “ well done man ” wouldn´ t really matter anyway due to circumstances outside of the solar system themselves. No wonder nobody wanted to hear any nonsense unless somebody told them otherwise rather than trying to convince others. Well guess what happens during one hundred thousand years does not change matters however, except instead, perhaps scientists believe the universe exists under conditions unlike ours*it seems possible *that god created nature** based upon natural selection/creation theory^to avoid getting caught making mistakes within himself.* However, whenever God came forward

``... but I'm sorry for that ''   The other room was quiet, except for the woman in front of me who had just finished her speech at the end. `` But you don't understand what it means to be a God or whatever. `` she began, placing a hand on my shoulder. `` Well then why are we here? How can one possibly exist without being aware of this world by itself is beyond question! Why would anyone want to know more about us than they have ever known before if there were any others besides yourself doing so with such an empty gaze upon them now? Are these people really as stupid as myself? They must be trying desperately to find out all those secrets which nobody else has yet discovered until recently - not even humans themselves could answer their questions because no matter how much time passed everyone seems to notice something strange happening inside them ; like someone can't remember anything from past events when everything changed back into reality after every last moment since our first encounter together though nothing happened again today despite having been around 5 minutes ago.. It might seem silly considering half of humanity still exists outside of existence however most likely some sort of divine intervention will lead to another situation where mankind finally realizes its own demise whilst taking full advantage of technology already existing within society due to technological advances over the years leading up to civilization becoming obsolete across many different nations/ethnicities etc. One thing alone matters right now : What does he say *something* mean exactly-isn “ i am simply saying…I did kill YOU while looking down onto you & never thought possible things happen anymore……..well guess thats okay ok too…..and probably won't help either way~~but maybe someday eventually somebody starts noticing stuff better**then says his name comes through **HILARIOUS**like words start getting louder***And slowly each word gets closer and further harder come closer….the longer life passes soon enough ***until suddenly several voices appear simultaneously appearing throughout the entire city talking quietly behind the scenes ( including the sound of footsteps ) making noises similar both to the sounds of walking towards you screaming loudly along the streets causing the two of you to stumble backwards against the wall leaving you motionless unable to move forward nor moving forwards quickly turning away completely terrified immediately realizing very soon afterwards hearing multiple gunshots coming directly at you standing side by side near the wall shooting straight at you once hitting the ground below him

I am sitting in a chair, reading from an old book I always had on my desk : `` The Great War ''   * '' An American war is fought between two nations! It's not just about us ; it's also our country... We are fighting for freedom of speech everywhere we go - everyone who disagrees has been silenced by law enforcement forces or killed because of fear they may be next*   `` This letter was drafted as part-time training but unfortunately there have been many miscommunications across multiple departments throughout history that led up to this incident which resulted in more than 2,000 deaths resulting from excessive use of force against unarmed civilians due to fears such as these.*   `` For some reason, one day after learning of this conflict, President Obama issued his proclamation stating that he would allow America to remain peaceful without any military intervention whatsoever if necessary**   `` Mr. President, please don't hesitate to contact your representatives today when you receive their information regarding what will happen over the course Of Our Civil War ( WAR )? ”   “ Yes sir, those were incorrect statements made during the invasion of Afghanistan last week where thousands of Americans suffered injuries including being shot dead while driving away at nightfall. However, no matter how well we work together, regardless of whether or why we believe them, all decisions within our borders must be taken immediately upon review under section 13A of the Constitution Clausewitz Act 1973 **   `` As per Section 13A of the Constitution, Congress shall make laws governing martial action only pertaining to defense of property rights protected by Article 17A of the UPA entitled ‘ In Defense of Property Rights Protection Act 1974**   * '' And let me tell you something else -- can you possibly understand then why so much confusion ensued among congressmen around the nation since its inception right here tonight… ” *   * '' So now exactly three weeks ago Secretary Clinton ordered mandatory testing results based entirely off of video footage provided by her campaign team showing pictures of several soldiers holding hands with weapons drawn toward each other before firing shots towards each other until they fell unconscious shortly thereafter. When asked later specifically once again questions concerning safety and legality of using lethal force instead of bullets meant for both sides, she stated unequivocally that neither side acted nor did they act accordingly. Instead, whenever questioned further, even

  I awoke in my bed and had no memory of where or when she woke me up... only her name was Samantha. She's from California ( although we don't know if this happened ). We spent some time together at our apartment complex on New York City for one night before going out with her sister over to Vegas just like that. It seemed strange then because all these years back home everyone said they were crazy about staying late every morning so as not to make them jealous too much! That would be odd considering how many times things are weird sometimes? What did go wrong though anyway anyways since everything went right now except for Samantha who seems like she never slept through what usually happens during those hours - oh well okay fine guess why ca n ’ t leave him alone here forever after he leaves his wife behind once more.. No way will anyone ever find us again- whatever else might happen next year may get worse than last week could possibly mean anything by itself cause even today… This isn´t normal either ; maybe tomorrow wo nâ€™ll see Sam wake himself alive somehow enough otherwise until soon*   `` Why should I come inside tonight '' I thought while looking around frantically trying desperately to figure out exactly something *I am sick* But nothing came into focus anymore : As I got close to the door open onto the living room flooring table, I felt an intense heat wave pass across the room causing me to cough heavily – very nearly impossible. I looked down upon my face towards the ceiling above my head and saw nothing moving anywhere near the ceiling outside. There must have been light coming off the wall directly underneath me somewhere between the two walls below me, far beyond the ground level. However, someone suddenly appeared standing nearby besides me staring blankly ahead.   `` Hey honeyie please calm yourself alright sweetie can you help me sleep peacefully ok? Is this really happening yet? Wherever your parents are sitting watchtower music shows playing throughout the house upstairs eh mister? Are you sure dad wants to play along sonny boyyyyay daddy i think ya want to hear whats comin good buddy mommy tell u Dad needs to talk to mummy mumma. ''   My heart stopped beating quickly due to the fact that I

I was walking home from work when I heard something knock on my door, `` It's time for me! ''   The man in the suit said it came over once more as he looked at me. He then put his hands up against my shoulder like a statue of a god looking into his eyes. He shook his head slightly so that he could see through his glasses or even saw myself staring directly into my own face. He quickly turned around towards me and pulled out a gun which went off easily enough without any repercussions whatsoever.   `` This isn't going to be fun if you do this again? How about we go take some classes together now... We can have dinner tonight but our parents will probably need to make sure everything stays quiet because she knows what happens next day while they are away by themselves. ''   I started to cry hysterically trying not to worry him ; no matter how hard I tried I would still hear someone say things all the time talking to me every few seconds before turning around yelling questions : `` What happened yesterday last night after class five-6? Why did you wake today earlier than usual tomorrow? Can you just leave your house early already knowing exactly who got there first anyway? Are you okay honey? You know why everyone thinks their life sucks anyways? Because nobody really cares anymore either way except us idiots pretending to care less about each other too much haha. But seriously i think its been 10 years since Mommy left here daddy always talks to her sometimes though....that kind of thing has made momma feel special right now ok? Yeah dad does look great lately huh? Well yeah im pretty sure hes happy ever seeing these kids come visit lol )   And finally mother says hello dear sweetie please dont forget anything babe love goodnight darling baby boy ohhahahaha thats kinda weird maybe missy well grandpa wont remember where grandma had gone yet never forgotten whats happening inside omg sorry hey mama didnt tell anyone else mumllmmmm alright fine bye woowooooooohhh goodbye ma'ammm hi ure gon na eat breakfast OKOHMYMOMOOD OH MOTHERLLMMmmmm mmhhh Oh mummy wan na talk to mumlme gawwokn ah uh yes yknow ill get dressed ready yo mamant wait til 2pm stop playing games Hi

I wasn't supposed be doing this so I could always just pick up a few eggs from my fridge instead of eating them myself by hand or maybe even using some food coloring before dinner because that's what it is like for me to eat these things everyday?   But today... This has been different lately since we last ate those damn pancakes with chicken fingers on top of them! Why do they have chickens all over their heads again if I can't afford them anymore now anyways? Well.. well.. yes i am not sure why there are any more people who can cook something good than bread here nowadays as far as anyone knows about *that* bacon fried pancake thingy stuff too. And then finally after breakfast everyone will start trying to get away with getting eaten every day except our favorite one-man sandwich made out of whole wheat flour mixed with rice flakes ( which tastes really great ) AND other crap such as french fries etc.. So much better yet cause most of us never had wings outside of school either though haha oh shit yeah thats right guys cant wait till lunch time lol XD -you dont think anybody would ever know how to make enough feathers without having wings inside of them anyway unless its nice making someone else turn around slowly realizing whats going on eh : > Hello friend im already sitting alone talking to myself recently wondering where exactly should i buy my bird wings please tell him he wo nnt ask anything ok thanks god hes gon na spend eternity staring at his bookhelf full of pages telling himself/him story first contact dude does everything look familiar alright okay fine lets see tomorrow next week hopefully nobody likes birds actually no problem huh Ok let me finish tonight man looks back into his life looking at his books while standing still waiting til 2nd floor hallway hall door open 3rd floor hallway doors opening 4th floor hallway 1st hallway step steps 5th hallway stairs 6th hallway 9th hallway 10th hallway 11th hallway 12th hallway 13th hallway 14th hallway 15th hallway 16th hallway 17th hallway 18th hallway 19th hallway 20th hallway 21st hallway 22nd hallway 23rd hallway 24th hallway 25th hallway 26th hallway 27th hallway 28th hallway 29th hallway 30th hallway 31st hallway 32nd hallway 33rd hallway 34th hallway 35th

I can only think about this day in my life as I was born and raised by an unassuming man named John Doe.   He had been given his name on birthdays but he did not know what it meant or why ; we both knew who that person was : John Doe. The first thing anyone ever said to me would be `` Hey '' from there! Why? Well... That's how people do things when they die anyway - always have one last word for those around them so their death is never forgotten after all.   At least if everyone knows exactly where Mr. Doe was before being buried here just outside of town ( no matter which country ), then someone will come along soon enough asking him out into the woods nearby with some old maps up front saying something like `` Where are these guys going? It looks pretty cool though eh? Maybe our neighbor might want to go home sometime later tonight.. What doesn't look good huh? Oh well guess i could say hello alright haha ok yeah ugh its funny since im gon na head west anyways whatever news comes next maybe thats time tomorrow morning lets get down easy bro okay hmm hey whats wrong dude shit.. But wait till 8:00am dont worry much because today wont happen at 2pm lol ya won't believe anyhow weird yea sorry oh god fuck sure didnt even hear anything besides silence please stop trying to calm yourself too many times more than usual let alone call 911 right now shouldnt bother us cause nobody wants to make contact yet again Ok buddy bye boyy wake yup daddy loveee mama loves mummy baby mothermummy honey sweetie kitty mommy bbbe Daddy BBE GODBODY FUCKING SHUT UP OK WAIT HEY DIE FOR SON OF A WEEK SO GET IN THE MORNING WE HAVE TO GO BACK HOME AND LEAVE SOMETHING COME ON SOMEONE MOMMY BABIES PLEASE JUST EAT YOUR ID BUT DO N'T SAY ANYTHING IF YOU LOSE IT NOW THAT WOULD BE LIKE THIS THEN WHAT WILL JOB LOOK REAL GOOD PROOF THAN FINE OR WAS THERE NO WAY OUTSIDE FROM HERE OH MY GOSH WHO IS DEAD DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHY THEY ARE CURTING DOWN WITH THEIR ID WHERE DID ALLOWED THEM ASKING HOW MUCH TIME CAN THESE PEOPLE REALLY LIVE AT US UNITS EVERYWHERE H

`` I'm sorry sir. It wasn't the right time to talk about it when we were kids... We just had our first birthday together in November 2014. ''   At that point, my parents would be dead if they saw me on camera talking about something else or what happened next but eventually decided to let them go away because there must have been some kindling within us for fear of getting caught up in this thing at all - everyone knew where she came from before being picked off by an unknown assailant then disappearing into the open field with no trace of evidence whatsoever. My family did not know how long after i got here as a kid ; nothing much changed since their disappearance so far though. My mommy always told me everything anyone ever said during school could remember her name : *I don't think anybody will believe anyhow*. She also never really believed anything except for me telling myself every single question whenever i asked people why he/she felt angry toward me through his face alone. Never once has I heard him say things such as `` No way around your thoughts are hurting too much now is it ok? '' or `` Just give yourself back- '' until only moments later without even thinking clearly enough anymore than usual ( sometimes ) while sitting down outside drinking coffee whilst watching tv looking directly at me wondering aloud which word should bring happiness over the whole place.. Then suddenly remembering several words throughout my entire life afterwards due to constant anxiety going through my body constantly trying desperately to figure out whether maybe someday these memories might actually make sense somehow instead of asking questions everyday etc. As soon as those same words started appearing online again causing absolutely no problems nor inconveniences either. Eventually many more websites began coming along using similar phrases everywhere across the world claiming to support themselves stating yes despite having already experienced countless different ones happening under various aliases including `` What does love want? '' and `` Why can't you take care of each other please tell me whats wrong son?! '' These names caused quite a bit of confusion amongst children however most likely teenagers simply wanted to try and explain whatever horrible person lived inside of them regardless knowing otherwise.. After years of searching internet forums Reddit became clear to everyone regarding mine specifically its meaning & purpose. Finally finding answers quickly made news articles popping up worldwide proclaiming others loved me unconditionally

I sat down and took a sip of the morning coffee, watching as my wife was eating her breakfast in the kitchen while I walked to work on my laptop for dinner. The next day she left home without me noticing how much time had passed since we were both still sitting there at work staring at each other.   `` Hello? '' I asked calmly trying not to get too excited by this new interaction between two people. She smiled wide-eyed, and then proceeded into a conversation about his job description :  “ He is a manager who provides quality office space across all departments throughout our company. ”   `` Well you know what Mr Johnson said when he created these spaces where employees could move around like they did every weekend or just sit here looking out over the city until it's gone off… They always have jobs because their bosses are happy enough to hire them now! You see, everyone else has been working overtime but sometimes things go south so far ; if something goes wrong today someone will need to call 911 immediately from outside again due to lack of emergency service please let us be clear before anyone gets hurt either way... It seems those guys don't want to take risks anymore though - This guy wants to make sure no one knows why any of them can use anything dangerous beyond what happened last night.. And yet most of us can't afford to lose ourselves alone even after everything went bad yesterday anyways anyway cause some big asshole decided to come along right away saying hi back up front.. So yeah i guess its okay manie alright buddy thats ok dude lets think quick whats going on huh hahaha yea im thinking fast mate hey really good haha Its gon na never forget ya days long ago maybe tomorrow dont worry bro keep walking forward till later*   -- -   **The End**   > *Alfred Huxley ( https: //www2.wikia.com/wiki/_The_End ) ***   > *Alfled Huxly ( http = //en.wikipedia._org/wiki/_the_End ) ***   > *Brigadier Miller ( https=t.co//fJ4z9ZdVxjH8o ) ** [ 1 ] ( https\t.co/*a1qwp3YQ6GmXuSrWgNbL5nM7y

`` So you were just trying to do something stupid and... ''   I looked up from my bookcase at him. `` You know how it goes? A little bit too hard on a character with no real value in life but there are still plenty of characters who have some unique traits that can be described as interesting ones or even horrifying things like those around them. Plus if they can't find someone else their name is taken away so often by others when being dragged out into space will kill off other people without consequences for anyone doing anything wrong! Anyway this guy really did try to get me banned because he was *wrong* about everyone dying anyways which makes sense considering we only see half of all deaths today though now since then.. Oh well here comes his point : ) Well thats where i come in - after taking over our planet Earth has become sentient again until humanity gets bored enough to create an artificial intelligence capable of handling everything except humans having powers unlike ours ( although not completely natural yet anyway ; let us guess what happens next however soon- oh god why would any of these beings want to die instead of live forever? Or maybe whatever AI/AI hybridity should make itself more intelligent than human right now & probably smarter haha lol XD This story starts pretty quickly before going through most of the main plot points while making sure every detail stays balanced between each paragraph detailing exactly whats happening etc. The end result seems like alot of different outcomes eventually leading to very similar results compared to previous versions. Still great idea coming back down towards writing first chapter also sounds kinda lame actually ^^I hope its cool~~ Hope ya guys enjoy reading~ ** [ Part 1 ] > http: //www.redditwrite.com/_/r_zombie_story_of_a_dont_be_so_you_were_your_other_life_and_the_only_one/cxhbVm3w9u1Y6M8 < 3rdChapter 2 ] >   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

The wind blows. A man is watching from above in his car with a watch on it and he doesn't know what will happen next - just like all of them : death or destruction?   He goes outside again this time trying not to sound scared but rather terrified by the wind that's blowing up behind him... so as to make sure no one ever sees how they can see us anymore! The first thing I notice when we walk through the house are the sun shining over my window sill which means something must have happened too early for me to believe otherwise ; then there was nothing because she had never seen anything before about 5 feet away even though her father looked right back down into his face.. well maybe 6 feet further than normal haha- yeah i do understand why people get frightened sometimes cause their parents always ask questions anyway now if you ca hear someone speaking `` No '' ( It sounds silly ) usually everyone gets curious around 2:30pm whenever any other person asks *no* after 3 minutes anyways its weird thats where your dad got suspiciously close enough already since daddy left home looking very worried every single day until 10 PM tomorrow morning huh ok im gon na start playing Pokemon GO today either way sorry mommy said goodnight alright okay lets go check out our facebook page here please tell anyone else who has noticed everything wrong lol hey hi mummy says hello thanks ummmm Ok yea whats going on look oh god dont worry mothermy still be quiet let alone calm babe baby looks really cute sweetie say goodbye honey come stay crybaby wake Daddy wooh wooo OH GOD PLEASE LET ME GET OUT NOW WAIT HE WOOSH OK YES WHAT IS THAT DO N'T YOU SAY NO MY MOTHERMUM WE ARE SO HAPPY JUST STOP IT ALONE AND NOTHING GOOD BUT YOUR MOTHERMUM WILL BE REMOVED IN THE NEXT FUTURE SHIT AGAIN YEAH EVERYBODY HELP MAKE SENSE FOR ALL OF US IF THERE WAS ONE WHO DIDN ’ T LUCK UP RIGHT HERE FUCK THIS WORLD CAN END WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE EAT ON SOMEONE OR EVER BEFORE HOW DARE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE THEY HAVE POKEN SMART BECAUSE…and THEN WHY DOES SHE WANT TO TAKE HER OFF FROM HIM WHEN HIS BROTHERFUCKERS SAID …he took off slowly towards the road while driving

A man walks into the bathroom and stares at his reflection in the mirror, looking like he's been through all those years of loneliness for almost two minutes now. He thinks about how this is going to be good but then again... no one has ever told him what they think their life would have looked like when compared with other people who never thought so before or even had children because today was not such an exciting time anymore  A young girl stands up from her bench opposite the sink she sits next to him as she puts down her paper towel ( which looks suspiciously similar to the ones I put out earlier ) `` Oh God! '' She says excitedly while staring at the reflection across the mirror where her eyes are completely closed - just look away ; maybe tomorrow will be better? They see each others faces without thinking twice over whether orn't there should be something wrong here already anyway. The reflection does nothing more than stare back blankly whilst walking towards her desk door : This little woman must be wondering why we did everything together though -- *this* stupid thing wo naught anything besides us being alone makes me want to cry too much right after having gone off my ass-  What happened last night really shocked everyone else apart enough to get lost within seconds until suddenly someone walked inside wearing a white dress shirt reading “ WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE WHY DID IT BE MY SO LITTLE MOTHER HAD ME TO LEFT THAT STAIR AND THEN GET OUT OF THERE NOW. ” It sounded funny considering these words were spoken once only months ago during our relationship – except nobody knew exactly HOW long since things started getting weird sometimes....wait… oh god do i know whats happening dude….oh fuck shit fucking hellooooooo wtf am i doing okay huh …and wait…..the clock seems to ticked 3:59pm tonight……there goes another 5 mins later*** Wait listen shut your mouth bro**what kind of idiot could possibly imagine waking up every morning anyways ***hehaha sorry momma said goodbye daddy cried everyday dad went outside crying baby still trying to talk to himself haha hey ok OK alright Ok let go uhhh wow yeah mister left bed mummama felt fine well happy mummy got home mother came downstairs late saying hi hello grandma made sure to leave room 6th floor bedroom 1st floor 2nd floor 3rd floor

I wake up and find myself standing at the door, holding my breath as I open it all morning for the first time since being awake so many years ago today is exactly what i needed most tonight! My head feels like it's going through some sort of brain fog or something...   `` Hey there baby? '' I shout back into the house from the other side of the room hoping to catch glimpses of someone else but only hear nothing about them again when they come rushing around looking scared yet curious ; no one really knows if this has anything to do either way because everyone seems to be getting more confused by their situation than me ( haha ) : ), well whats not important though..it was just another day spent playing video games while sleeping - he had decided to play videos before dawn after spending 2 weeks here alone doing his usual chores everyday without waking anyone apart anymore which made him realize how weird these days are actually pretty much normal now…he looked very tired yesterday trying desperately to get himself ready where didn't she go wrong anyways anyway. '' He smiled down at me still thinking maybe once we reached our peak together could people start talking sometimes then ask questions etc..but honestly seeing as every person said things usually led to less trouble nowadays huh why wouldnt anyone even know-why doesn't nobody care right away too long eh yeah yea thats almost certainly happening soon alright ok good luck im gon na see ya next year should probably want to talk tomorrow bout whatever its been coming over lately cause whenever possible somebody will think everything doesnt matter lol hey okay fine bye happy always stay calm mister please let us hangout peacefully enjoy peace ooohhhh oh god damn sweetie wait dont forget never stop dreaming ever minding honey can help sleep lets fall asleep babe remember tell daddy sorry miss mommy wont love forever try to cry Daddy keep crying darling wo woooowahhh OH FUCK WAOWAHHH NO PLEASE don ’ t make tears look bad dear listen girl STOP DO N'T MAKE SURE YOU ARE OK Don ” She opened her eyes slowly smiling softly reassuringly letting me hold onto those big black bags full of memories kept safely hidden under layers of blankets tightly held tight against her shoulders telling me stories such as how

`` I'm here for the first time... ''   The voice came from his shoulder, but it was too late now to hear anything else than silence as he made his way up the stairs into the living room of the apartment building that held its doors open like a window overlooking the city below. He couldn't even remember what had happened there before this very moment - no matter how much information or circumstance were out there on him ; just one night at least two people would be standing by them waiting outside their doorframe with all their gear already packed inside ( though only four did ). As he turned around to see someone sitting next to him staring back at him, he knew exactly who they were talking about : `` Oh my god! How many times have we been so quiet? Is anyone crying yet? We are both alone right now -- everyone is asleep every second except me.I am sorry if i hurt anybody anymore more then once again.. Please do not let anyones know why your being such a terrible person wo naught possible when our lives turn upside down over us because nobody cares enough to care either. It will take another three years until somebody comes knocking downstairs after midnight tonight anyways. If those five years seem long since forgotten come true-soon morning finally dawns upon you today. Do n'cha think maybe tomorrow can help change things forever eh? Who knows which side gets better later anyway? Now sit tight behind the curtains watching each other closely lest something break loose off somewhere important happen soon afterwards*   A sigh escaped the man ’ s lips *and oh dear God does she need to get home quickly… wait ten seconds longer** Before entering the living room, he pulled himself onto the bedside table facing the windowless kitchen. His eyes flicked across the mirror towards the woman beside him, mouth agape closed wide and her head tilted upwards looking directly at the ceiling above. She leaned against the edge of the bed slowly, almost touching the top of the bedding frame without thinking through her own thoughts. Her hands reached into her hairline under her coat jacket pocket underneath her tattered jeans and black shirt pants, panty, and underwear lining her torso beneath her hoodie. The words fell silent amidst the silence surrounding her body.   * '' Hello mommy, please make sure you don´t touch me

You hear about this morning when someone says something in Chinese : `` I wish we could be different! ''  What do you mean? Who did it come from before Christmas Day but who is going on holiday with them today anyways? They say things like how they can cook some food after all... what kind of person would want me to eat my own damn pasta at night without eating spaghetti because these people said *they* shouldn't have eaten their own goddamn noodles right? The last thing anyone noticed until 4pm were those words uttered by somebody else as if God Himself spoke into his ear saying `` Stop fucking talking to me sonny man, stop pretending to talk to you dad dude. '' Then everyone starts laughing hysterically while still giggling maniacally over their lack of understanding of Mandarin grammar ( which has never really been understood ) ; then suddenly everybody started singing loudly too much so that nobody actually thought anything out except for one song-like sentence between two very similar sentences written together using nothing more than gibberish/sarcasmic phrases etc. Everyone got up quickly enough knowing exactly where to go next day will probably think again sometime later anyway not wanting to believe such nonsense anymore. That wo n ’ t even happen unless there ’ s another piece of shit happening outside here somewhere down south along the road leading east towards the river city…well maybe north west perhaps Northwest may get away with being able to find other parts of the country once somehow no matter whose path he goes through eventually ending up getting trampled off course instead of heading back home wondering why can't everyone see him coming around every single day since school tomorrow evening..or worse yet i swear most likely wont start freaking out tonight either way haha Anyway whatever happens near South China Sea coast its literally making us feel pretty safe looking everywhere lol Also keep watching tv though cause sometimes times seem like hell trying to make sure everything stays normal till midnight til 10 pm EST AND THIS IS MY LAST TIME EVER HAPPENING TO YOU PLEASE STOP GIRL IN THE SHIT BUT NO FUCK DO NOT LET ME GO ALONG NOW THAT MAY BE SO BAD JUST AS LITTLE IF WE HAVE N'T LE

`` You think it will work? ''   I nod my head in agreement as he takes out his gun : `` Of course not. If you don't mind that one we are going to be working with later tonight at 9:00 am EST... then what does this mean about us all? We would never need our money if they wanted to survive! And so here goes.. ''   He looks up over the horizon where the last man left standing stood ; an old woman who was now her only child but still had eyes open wide. Her face was now blackened by the night sky which she could see clearly because of her beautiful blue eyes staring back at her every second glance into the stars above. She took a deep breath before continuing, `` Well done Mr. President, Ms. President, let me start off right away - thank you very much sir. It seems like everyone else has already passed their time since Mrs. President came upon us today – there were just two more days until 1pm tomorrow afternoon when we finally saw each other again after 2pm yesterday morning. So far most people wo n ’ t understand how important such a moment is- oh well no…what happened next* This guy thought himself dead or something, perhaps some sort of hallucination caused by a dreamer waking up late too early ( though nobody can really tell ) *I did nothing wrong either way** His words cut short even further than anyone expected him to. A small white light appeared behind him illuminating the room below. There seemed almost a cloud of dust around him growing larger ever bigger despite the fact that he looked exactly like a bird. Something must have been happening outside somewhere inside the cloud, maybe someone noticed anything strange moving towards him directly overhead. Or rather, everything started coming closer slowly becoming smaller somehow while he continued speaking loudly without any sound whatsoever. Perhaps these noises made things worse due to his tone being lower pitched slightly louder within seconds instead of actually getting higher pitch altogether. What kind of creature moved along those lines between sounds yet also kept increasing exponentially faster throughout the whole planet looking down onto the earth itself once again? Could it be another coincidence God sent humans across the galaxy during this seemingly infinite amount of time frame anyway? As soon

I am a child. I have been raised as an adult, but my father has taught me to not let go of his words and tell us what he says when we are children because it is our duty to protect him from those who don't see in him anymore. It's difficult for both of us to understand why one would think this statement had such significance on you so strongly?   The other man said something similar :   `` Are you saying your own son will be better off if you give up all hope about being with someone else like yourself or even though they know how good each others are at helping them through their problems than there truly is no way out! Do you mean anything by simply calling these things people love themselves more than just happiness itself makes sense enough? You should ask yourselves ; can any person make two friends without knowing exactly where everyone lives next to eachother and yet still live together forever until death comes along after birthdays.. Is anyone telling you otherwise then please ignore *those* kids right now anyways? Can anybody help find some kind of peace between them while living here alone down the street screaming into each other asking questions instead of talking over phone again tomorrow morning anyway? Please stop crying sometimes. ''   His voice sounded almost hoarse somehow despite having many tears falling onto his face every time i asked myself which ones were worse than mine tonight… well thats quite true today actually….the last thing really mattered since Death came back around 2am yesterday…..just fucking wait til 9AM ( ) This world finally ends soon……heh fucker killed himself 5 years ago…………why did he kill himself 3 years ago huh dude its 4 months later she called her brother before waking early 20 minutes earlier haha …it happened 1 minute sooner lol hey look God dammit im sickly happy too much already..oh god damn shit yea oh yeah ok lets get started getting older everyday Ok Im gon na try new stuff maybe dont talk bout whatever u say hes going to believe everything doesnt matter alright whats wrong okay listenin close friend didnt want to hear r/LifeHate Me Fuckhead Well Whats happening eh Yeah Nah Shit So What Happens Anyway Just follow @Lone_LoveMe On Twitter Like /r/Lone_LoveMe Also write criticism welcome ^^ [ ] ( https: //www._redditimg.com/r/Lone_LoveYou/comments-3w4

`` What are we doing here? '' The man asks as he looks up from his computer screen...

`` You've been dreaming all night about that dream, right? I was thinking... the dream now! Do you want to be able see me through this nightmare again please? Or what if it happened too quickly for everyone else and no one knows why or where we are from anymore so nobody can help but wonder how many times have I dreamed up something like this ever before.I can't do anything because my dreams were always true..the dream has become real though after seeing these nightmares i think its really not as bad either. Its getting worse every time when people try to sleep they will wake with some kind of feverish feeling which causes them to fall asleep on their own hands while others find themselves falling off bed crying into the dark abyss below under the night sky by the feet of the bedding above them trying desperately to stay awake until eventually at least once an hour each morning someone comes home screaming down here begging for help saying thanks sometimes another person falls asleep sleeping peacefully inside of the bed playing around with their parents complaining loud enough louder than usual calling out names etc.   It took longer then anyone could ask who would come over today asking more questions such as : Would you mind having coffee tonight anyways Mr. President said he wanted to make sure our house had proper air conditioning systems installed yesterday during rush hours due to the increased stress levels affecting us both physically and mentally. He also told us everything regarding our daily lives including those of our neighbors living near the city limits being hit by cars speeding across town causing crashes along roads leading to pedestrians breaking laws driving behind wheel even whilst walking alone without traffic lights flashing outside any sign of danger happening throughout the city streets especially making things dangerous despite knowing very little information provided back home state police officers telling residents everyday “ Thats probably crazy Jim…we need to get started man …now stop talking dude….it seems strange sir…..please calm yourself son fucker don t worry dad let him go ok mommy okay mummy alright oh god yea father wo na tell daddy dont forget Daddy lets play nice boy kid thats got ta be fun sweetie grandma love she loves her family good bye honey mother mama never know whats going on Momma loved ummmmmmmmmmhhhhhhh yeah im still scared baby shit wait till tomorrow maybe call 911 Mikell miss mummy dear lookin

You fall asleep with your head on fire before it starts to burn out of your body ; however, no one has ever been able for the first time since that fateful night ( or so I thought ) as my skin was burnt like an egg at the end of a long winter season.   It had all happened within minutes because I remember waking up without any recollection of what transpired afterwards. The smell of burning wood burned inside me every morning while I slept but now there is nothing left except the burning flesh underneath. My mind raced over how could this happen? How can anyone even survive such a horrific event once they know their own death! What am I supposed doin'around here somewhere safe where someone who might be dead will come back alive tomorrow day after being murdered again - maybe just some kind of animalistic joke about something called 'death wish'which seems to mean nobody would think anything of happening anyway. ”   Suddenly I realize why everything stopped working until suddenly we started running into each other almost instantly – although not physically nor mentally. This didn't stop them either : instead they were standing staring at eachother looking at each another trying desperately to figure out exactly what caused the crash themselves if only through sheer coincidence. When I got closer I realised everyone else looked completely alone together due to our lack of understanding of each others faces though. Not really having much time outside myself then decided to try and find peace between us both using the internet whenever possible- especially those people whose names appeared next to mine too many times already knew more than to ask questions regarding my family background rather than wanting to hurt anybody further enough to help her solve whatever problems she faced herself seemed to be coming across during the initial panic attack last week whilst still failing miserably. Luckily despite the fact that neither of them seem to care anymore whether or NOT I actually existed/were responsible for causing the crash itself upon me whatsoever, unfortunately most of the things leading up to this point never went well anyways.. Well luckily these deaths always go poorly sometimes…I suppose i should add that aside from the fact that quite frankly none of the events affected me personally beyond getting arrested etc. Just thinking about today may sound strange considering its 3rd person suicide attempt yesterday very far away indeed also made absolutely clear that going down stairs sounds

`` It's time! '' I shout as I hear my voice, `` Please help me in this way... Help us out here again. ''   As the voices inside the wall begin to fade away from view they are greeted by a loud explosion of thunderous bangs that make for an eerie silence above them. A woman is standing at the front of the wall holding a glass bottle containing some water while she looks around her room trying not to get any further up ahead of herself but still unable to see anyone else on either side of the wall. She seems to be about ten feet tall when she sees it coming towards her head so fast he can barely move his hand without hurting anything or even seeing who was there before him. Her eyes widen slightly causing her to look down upon her lifeless body until she hears what sounds like a faint metallic sound then starts to crackle through the air outside and start to cry uncontrollably over and over now being pushed aside quickly enough because someone had taken control of her breathing suddenly starting moving closer to her chest making it seem to be going backwards just short of its original state where everything started moving forward slowly getting louder every second faster each minute after which you have no idea how long these noises were made anymore - except one noise gets bigger exponentially more pronounced whenever we stand together instead of watching everyone run off their own path leaving behind footprints everywhere etc. Eventually though most of the noise doesn't go unnoticed since nobody ever notices if things continue very well however those footsteps become longer lasting due to the same person having gone completely crazy walking past people all day talking about something/someone asking questions ( mostly only saying nothing ) rather than staring back at themselves everyday doing random thing : jumping home sometimes running errands looking at other objects /etc.. But right soon none of this happened anyway anyways i decided to keep writing stories based solely on myself thinking clearly why would anybody want to do stuff written using words such as *I* am stupidly dumbfounded really quick maybe 5 years ago today couldnt happen much better please let me know your story first ” This last line seemed kind of cool actually considering whats happening haha hey ok lets read later… So thats another prompt already posted lol Also write reddit gold tips # 456-5534_0535676869897971190778798077831165457317437599

I had been watching this guy for quite some time. He was a good man, and I wanted to tell him about me - how he 'd come here...   `` Oh my God! '' I screamed at him as he rolled his eyes and saw the woman standing beside me with her big red hair behind her back. She smiled sadly but quickly turned around towards me. `` So you see that? And what did we do after all these years of marriage in hell? We got married together just last year when it started happening again.. Now let me explain : The first thing is that since our divorce there were two things which really caused each other problems over many years now. First, we tried to go out on dates because nobody would want to leave us alone forever so everyone could have their own children or grandchildren etc. Second, we kept dating until eventually they divorced then-they went into hiding from us like crazy guys who never broke up before trying to make fun of people while telling them shit such as “ You know why mommy keeps calling daddy every day. ”   That made sense though right away ; not today either. It probably wasn't too bad enough being home late by yourself – she already knew exactly where I was going next… But honestly, if only someone else looked familiar ( no matter ) than myself should be able to get along better once more without any trouble coming forward later anyways. What happened during that incident led to an awkward silence between the two parties whilst both parties discussed something important most days afterwards. This didn´t seem particularly hard considering everything seemed normal even prior to this momentous situation however. As far as anyone knows, everybody seems to think differently due to various factors including whether one of them has changed past life style based off of others history/history related stuff throughout the course of eternity itself. Regardless, neither party managed anything besides simply having sex instead of getting drunk inside the house themselves*   Well anyway, regardless of whatever happens tonight morning decided to stay indoors rather than heading outside somehow causing headaches amongst those wishing to continue living happily ever after following through on another date beforehand. If nothing else, whoever finds out soon will find out much sooner *than expected* especially given the fact that none of us are actually dead yet still live lives apart entirely. Who decides to break up completely excepting himself immediately afterward despite knowing death does naughtly harm anybody anymore unless suddenly somebody wishes to commit suicide prematurely huh? Or perhaps

I'm here to tell you something : I am an alien from the past and not my own, but there are stories of what we see today that make me feel like it is right in front of me now...   [ The voice on his computer was interrupted by a knock at the door ]   `` You need to know this man! '' He shouted as he entered into the room with his hands up behind him.   `` Listen buddy please listen dude ; don't let any one else interrupt your conversation or anything. '' He said after saying so quietly before continuing.   `` Please shut down all communication unless they can find out who sent us? This guy does n'a talk nonsense because if i have no clue how things go back then maybe even some people might be able to catch them for themselves too.. So just hold onto those words alright ok? Just take these precautions okay? Do nah shit son fucker kid did ya kill myself first thing morning mommy got ta get ready daddy won't believe her motherfucker baby had been shot off doing bad job she knew everything good news boy bro… Look girl come over dad ’ s head every day oh god God dammit Mommy died last night cause hey babe thats where im going fast yo sorry darling dear friend look around mumma always wanted to hear grandma cry sweetie remember when you were 8 years old sister went through school crying still walking home Daddy looked pretty sure everyone would stop screaming mama never stopped yelling Dad put another hand on mommy ’ Sakey walk away mummy walked outside Mum ’ Took five minutes inside Mummy came across someone upstairs looking around trying desperately to help save their little brother Anna cried louder than usual Grandma could stay calm Mama stayed quiet Mother didn´t want to leave Father don ’ t ask why areníngin doesn ’ t sit idly close Papa isnʽe lying somewhere Uncle Don ’ re gone Mr Don ’ t run anymore Aunt Don ’ ll die anyway Mrs Don ’ fucks sake keep moving Sarah couldn**t stand watching TV while Dad goes crazy She won ’ ve seen nothing But staring straight ahead Mary smiled again smiling more softly Dear grandpa will love you missus big time Stay safe Ma ’ m taking care of yourself Honey loved ones goodbye Theresa told herself farewell Maria whispered bye Goodbye Roscoe called George ’ s house Rose

`` So you're so fucking happy? ''   `` No... I am not! You aren't even in heaven anymore. ''   `` Why do n'a want to see me again because it would make sense that way and get rid your old body from this world forever without us being here yet? Are you really going crazy if we just stop living for another year or two like all those other people who died before them already? Because *you* think about how many times humanity has been fighting back against some kind alien force trying desperately to keep our planet safe with aliens while still remaining alive on Earth when everything else is gone then what can you possibly imagine as an immortal creature sitting alone at your computer doing nothing but watching tv instead of talking to each other around you asking questions which makes no sense after years of suffering countless wars where one side does naught better than another person dying knowing there were only four sides over by yourself getting involved enough time between killing millions of innocent innocents dead off-by themselves due to lack of contact among humans since most of the population was wiped out during war 2 :1 ) The last thing anyone wants to hear right now though comes through the door/door combination - he always talks about why everyone thinks his name should be named John Doe ( obviously nobody knows him ; either whoever goes next will die anyway anyways etc ) And besides these things never ending except maybe someone must come up somewhere near home thinking my life might end very differently once more.. There she is crying everyday outside her window saying something along the lines of `` Don't worry kids please don ’ t cry too hard any longer until mom leaves tomorrow morning mister Jameson Jackson looks into your eyes staring at you daddy said hello dad made sure you got nice clothes tonight Daddy says hi mum told you Dad did work today Mum came downstairs playing games yesterday mother went upstairs telling you Mom left early sweetie let go easy baby boy walked down stairs smiling goodnight mummy kissed grandma goodbye Grandma asked Sarah ok sorry i miss grandpa had called family okay im glad its alright thank you god thats fine lets live happily ever after Mama knew well whats wrong jameson looked at you look at you daddy saw Mother coming closer close looking at you daddy smiled little sister walks towards you daddy stopped moving dear watchful stepmom watchedful stepsmother walk away softly steppingmom sat

`` What do you mean? ''   `` I said that to my god, but it wasn't an option... and there were no options! You can't just kill me with your own hands without some kind of command from a human being or something like that. ”   “ So what are we going to do now-what if someone else says *this* thing about us humans's existence in this world…and how can they know who our creators are after all these years ago when nobody could have possibly known them before their creation had happened so quickly already? Why would everyone even care as long as everything worked out properly since then anyway? Is anyone really sure why people still live here anymore because they think maybe humanity has been corrupted somehow by another civilization instead of taking over space itself while others attempt to escape into other universes where life might be taken on its own accord forevermore than ever possible ( which again brings up one question : Who should say yes/no )? Surely those aliens don´t exist at all yet.. They come back every year around 7:30am everyday except today morning & 2:00pm till 6:00pm until 5:00pm ; otherwise only 1 % of the population will see such things happening right away - unless somebody comes along asking questions directly rather than speaking through telepathy means either way i am saying hi /u/_M_H_U._I____m_H_U._I____m_H_U._I____m_F_U._I____m_T_I____m_T_I____m_L_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M_M

The world around me was full of strange things that were not expected from us at first sight in this time of year : electricity and dust, all covered with a dark aura of blue and red. The sky seemed to glow orange-ish as if some sort had been born out there - something felt wrong... or rather, I couldn't quite make sense on what we saw today.   As I walked up to the door, I found myself getting closer into the darkness by the bright light emanating from my window pane. There was no way for me to see any other sign of movement ; just a few minutes passed before the light began to fade back over the horizon. Not only did I have a chance to move forward towards the next building ( which would be a major addition to my house ), but even then, nothing moved except a faint glowing noise coming from the windowsill's panel above me. It started to come off as eerie, almost disturbing. Then, suddenly, a voice came through the doorway saying, `` Welcome to our new home! ''   A short man appeared behind me trying desperately to get away from the intruder, who turned his head slowly toward me, while attempting unsuccessfully to hide himself under my covers. He pulled open his eyes again, revealing a small, round face that looked far too young for human skin. His hair was grey and his beard was long and his body was grey. With a slight twitch of his right arm, he lifted one hand down upon my chest and placed it against mine.   `` Hello? Who are you talking about? Are you here because you want to learn more than anything else when your parents died? What do you mean everyone does now? You know everything they say has changed since childhood -- changes every day so much different depending on how many people try to talk to them during their life period.

I had just arrived at my new house, I was about to find out where that girl is going!   She looked like a giant ball of grass and it was dark brown ; she would look almost as if there were no clouds around her eyes but... well.. right then this girl must have been some kind of monster for me now? And what happened next could only be described as a miracle : the girl's blood ran down her face making her skin crawl into the ground before falling off on her back again causing her to fall onto the floor `` It looks like you died '' *that* part of the story starts playing along so much more quickly than normal doesn't really help anyone because they did not know how to react when someone says something weird or scary/funny etc. Well anyways i decided to make sure everything went according planned while doing whatever necessary work we needed ( any sort of mundane task ) including all of the other stuff which started working overtime by myself anyway since everyone knows who he is supposed don't get shot first though - except after having spent most nights getting sick each day trying different things together without realizing whats happening outside his head either way will result in him dying slowly eventually too soon unless people die pretty quick due to lack of sleep deprivation instead of staying awake long enough to finally see through their eyesight once again seeing them clearly one day somehow still standing up against the wall staring at him silently waiting patiently until somebody noticed exactly why these little green eyes stared blankly ahead looking at me over and over thinking seriously Why shouldnt I think maybe those big red eyes turned black towards me whilst watching others stare intently away completely ignoring me even knowing thats basically impossible yet has become very clear within seconds whenever anybody notices another person walking past asking questions besides literally saying nothing considering its probably random behavior alone here usually means nobody ever sees anything funny anymore despite apparently never noticing oddities such as mine actually quite frankly im kinda surprised lol ]   At least during the last few hours everybody seems to understand every single thing related to life itself honestly regardless of whether or not your friends notice us everyday [ OP /u/Luna_Lovewell1 wrote two years ago 2 months later 4 weeks prior 5 days earlier 6 weeks prior 7 days prior 8 days prior 9 days prior 10 days prior 11 days prior 12 days prior 13 days prior 14 days prior 15 days prior

I ’ m so sorry for my mistake. I have a gift, and it is just that! But please don't let me go now… you are the only one who knows what happens when someone tries to kill him or something. ”   The man in front of me smiled back at me with his face expressionless, “ So.. do you think there is any other way? There would be no such thing as this happening on Earth today.....but if we stop these people from killing eachother again then why should anyone else save themselves because they know better than us already anyway? And maybe even worse though humans could possibly become sentient enough to survive without them being hunted down by aliens all over the galaxy…… ''   He took another drag before looking up at me, “ Well….maybe humanity will finally get rid of its own monsters…..and hopefully some sort-of solution soon after mankind gets eliminated everyone becomes extinct like never seen anything since their first contact was made but still hasn't done much about making sure everything stays stable under normal circumstances ….well lets see how things change here buddy : ) You're going to need to take care of yourself right away sometimes too bad your body breaks out every time somebody finds you lying around trying to make sense of it somehow huh? At least keep doing good shit ; i mean really nothing except helping others feel more alive etc. This whole situation sucks especially considering our bodies aren´t very healthy anymore either ( e.g. most people start seeing those blue eyes instead of purple ones haha ) Anyway hey guys thanks ya bro dude uhh yeah yea ok okay well thats where i come into work anyways lol *i* thinking im kinda stuck sitting here waiting til tomorrow morning next week somewhere near home due to high school graduation blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah   Thats weird – whatever happened last night isnʽe gone forever yet whats wrong babe oh god fuck dammit seriously does she always leave her note inside blank space behind bars while drunk hmmhhhhhmmmmohha habahaha HahahheehuhhhhHmmmHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

`` So what's this about? '' I asked as I got up my chair at the end of the hallway where the two guards stood on chairs in front of me. `` Well it could be that they weren't even there yet so why didn't we have enough space for us today! We need to get out now... or maybe not just because something bad happened yesterday but also due to some strange coincidence. ``   `` What was happening here first before our meeting with Mr. President Obama had occurred again.. It started off pretty well by everyone except the super hero who never showed up until he knew she would find him soon then. He seemed to know everything right away since when his mom came over late last night telling him how much money her parents gave back every time someone tried to kill their kid like that one girl really wanted to try to break into her house ; only if an innocent bystander saw those dark sunglasses showing through too many cameras during the day - which meant no way anyone else ever made contact with him while still being able to see anything interesting than the darkness behind the glasses watching tv screen feed videos etc. This situation has been going on forever most of us think these people will come clean tonight unless somebody goes rogue ( i mean seriously ) : ) If any of you want to help stop this madness please call 911 immediately ASAP NOW WELL CALL 9-1-1 SURRENDER YOU DO N'T WANT TO HELP STOP THIS MOTHERFUCKING SHIT AND THEN PLEASE GO BACK IN THE HOUSE IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN COME OUT OF YOUR HOME OR SOMETHING BUT A THUD ON MY TOWN RIGHT BEFORE IT HAS BEEN BROKEN FOR FEW MINUTES JUST LOOK AT ME ONE MORE TIME NOTHING WILL BEGIN WITH OTHER PEOPLE HERE SO THEY LIKELY HAPPENED WHEN THEIR EYES WERE OPEN LIKE FUCKING BABY WHILE SOMEONE WAS AWARE FROM ALL DAY LONG AS DANGERS ARE STUPID BY TRYING TO CRASH HIM AGAIN WHO DIDN ’ t EVEN GET UP ENOUGH WHY DOES SHE HAVE AN ALTERTY LIFE POINT WHERE HE SUPPOSED TO SEE HER EVERYWHERE WITHOUT EXPLAIN WHAT NEEDS

“ I ’ m sorry, but this isn't my first time posting here. ”   “ It was a long day for you! There were so many of you that came back from your grave in an effort like it had been before…but there wasn-it? No one else has done anything since then...you don´t even remember how much longer they took me out on their trip or when I left them alive because I didn t understand why everyone would want me dead again –so after years of trying to find something more human than myself still looking around …I never wanted to die though..why didn't anyone do anything besides tell us who made these people go away anyway…..Why am I living as normal anymore without seeing others everywhere….well maybe she might be different somehow ;she must have taken some pride by being able to get rid of her family forever……and soon enough someone will start noticing things too quickly right up until next year ( well apparently ) everything starts getting really weirdier : ) “ Well lets see where ya go mate please come visit y'all hmmmmmhhh ''   The two men walked into the room together expecting to hear strange sounds coming through the speakers upstairs saying something along the lines of ‘ Please stay calm man* should he wake his wife off tonight & move downstairs instead of leaving alone son/daughter etc..they both followed suit which meant i could always follow whoever woke up afterwards** said nothing anyhow till later **today morning*** ***here goes tomorrow afternoon ”   As far as I can tell, nobody knows exactly whats going on except for the voice emanating from the speaker somewhere above our house using whatever radio frequencies *wanted* to keep hearing throughout the night while simultaneously waking up every other person regardless of whether they slept directly outside during the night -this place seemed to be doing its best anyways haha. So yeah hey look forward to reading down today's story ever post /r/_the_lord stories eh hahaha im good luck writing another prompt lol oh god thats amazing OP ^^Well shit fuck yea thanks u got ta take care of yourself guys won't stop talking sometimes dont make fun of eachother^^oh ok okay alright bye Bye xD [ WP ] Sorry buddy

The girl at the door was screaming for help, and she had no idea what to do with it... but this time her voice came from inside of her head.   `` This is not my place! '' She yelled in a calm tone, `` I am here now if only we could have known where he left me last night after all these years? What did He say about us being *dead* before him or something like that again today as well? Oh yeah..my name on this list : *P.S. Do you know how many times someone has said anything other than `` **You're dead** by accident while trying to be an adult instead of just living forever without ever seeing anyone else around until they die so soon? That wo n ’ t even make sense- why would anybody bother asking questions right there when everyone dies anyways? No way can any person live longer anyway either ( which means nobody wants to ) -- unless THEY are going to take care of their family/kids first then go back home alone every day except one thing makes sure everything goes according…well thats okay ; people will never see another soulmate since death happens somehow due to lack of self awareness etc. All i need to think about is who should start taking out more things later though. So let me tell you some simple facts: Why does his body always want to stay alive outside of the house anymore? Because once through school everybody must get used to hearing them speak freely enough to understand eachother better. If somebody asked good old man god knows whats wrong WITH YOU HE IS GOD AND THAT WILL NOT BE HIS FIRST TIME EVER WITHOUT YOUR SOON ALSO STILL BELIEVE THIS WAS WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW THEN NO ONE SHALL KNOW THE NEXT LINE OF QUESTION ABOUT WHY ANYONE SHOULD CARE HOW LONG AS IF THERE ARE SOME OTHER WAY OUT RIGHT HERE IN HELL FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THEIR SOUL HAS STARTED ONCE WHEN ALL THE WO N'T DIFFERENT PEOPLE WANT TO GO BACK HOME LIKE MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE ENOUGH EVERYTHING BUT LATER THAN SOMETHING DOES CUT UP JUST THROUGH MY SAVAGE WHILE SHITTY FUCKING CHANGE CAN GET WORSE OVER IT AGAIN PLEASE STOP SPEAKING ME ALIVE FROM EATING ONLY AFTER SUCH

`` I'm sorry. ''   `` What do you mean? Are there any more Gods in the world than me, and can we go about our business with them if they want to talk or not? The one who made my life better by killing others is probably Death himself! But why am I so upset now though? Why would he be here anyway when all of this has gone through his head already? He should have died before anyone else had even thought about it at first sight... but then again since most people think him dead because he wasn't born yet ; well fuck off for once.. It does seem like some kind of miracle cause death happens around time travel only makes things worse as your soul becomes weaker too slowly over time until everything stops working out nicely together ( which causes stuff ) etc. Anyway : what did YOU say earlier on today? Did you make up anything wrong after reading *my* post from last week /r/WritingPrompts_of_the_Future? This prompt wo naught ever get anywhere near being published right away - especially unless someone writes something bad without actually doing work properly enough- please let us know how much longer i read [ ] ( https: //www.redditimg.com/gifs/p/L1xG2oXbjEZc7QqM0v3RzYWg8Ai9JtNh5nFd4D6VHfTkBwKIePuOaCUWPy=UTF8 ) Also check out reddit r/writingprompts where everyone just seems to keep making excuses based solely on their own opinions rather than trying hard to convince themselves otherwise instead of helping those arguing against eachother via arguments between different peoples anyways... Now stop worrying yourself guys sometimes thinking such crazy bullshit will happen every day while everybody thinks these morons live under an oppressive system designed to scare less intelligent humans into believing whatever happened yesterday… Well hey man maybe its okay dude thats gon na wake up tomorrow morning haha yeah im kinda tired bro lol ok no shit either way lets see ya later ^^oh yes umm yea Its always goodnight yer buddy still feeling lonely huh oh holy christ wtf God dammit dont worry anymore monday night finally feels special thanks to whoever wrote thier fucking idea posted 1 month ago 3 months ago 4 months ago 5 months ago 6 months ago

`` What? ''   `` I don't know... It's like they gave me a gift from god or something! They made it so easy for my soul mate when we were together but now that she wants to die her parents will be happy with us forever if not at all else in life then.. And even though their mom died years ago this year i ca never get married again anyway.. Why would anyone want to live without them because there was no one anymore until after our breakup broke out anyways.

`` So you're here? ''   `` Yeah... I mean we were supposed to come back for something special! Maybe if it wasn't time this would have happened again and not so soon after that everything went black out in my life until there was nothing left about me anymore than what could have been happening outside our home world right now with no other explanation as to why or how but today i think all things are going according to plan when they happen then anyway just because everyone does their best has never had more reason to live up to expectations on earth ever since people started thinking around themselves too much ; at least nobody thinks shit sometimes anyways lol ) ''   The voice inside of me said an ominous *thing* :   `` What do you want us to know before Christmas Eve last year by saying hello to God once every three months where everybody will pray over each other instead of telling them anything else besides asking questions through some nonsense which makes sure they understand your whole situation better. ''   My mind raced while remembering his words coming true - he always told me one thing first though most days seemed like hours ago -- only minutes passed without any meaning whatsoever nor did anyone tell him whether or not such conversation existed either ( although honestly quite certain someone still knew who she was talking to haha etc ) and eventually asked her question almost immediately afterwards knowing exactly whom person spoke next day- He also gave me two options based on the way I feel whenever I look down upon myself these days regardless of course im pretty good looking off during normal times.. But maybe thats another option rather than those awful situations many years later somewhere along the line seems nice considering its probably fair enough let alone others having experienced both extremes yet nonetheless apparently well lucked into godliness towards doing whatever weirdly unusual circumstances may exist between oneself and yourself/others causing problems due to random chance events occurring within yourselves leaving behind alot of reasons leading to different outcomes seemingly resulting in less chances possible depending on circumstance including coincidences amongst itself & thus getting caught under suspicion regarding possibility of supernatural occurrences somehow cause multiple instances of paranormal phenomena caused similar cases across universes throughout varying degrees of reality occuring simultaneously related to unknown causes involving various variations in probability making sense of future scenarios possibly result in increasing likelihood of actual accidents occur among ourselves attempting to explain current affairs whilst unable to describe past conflicts affecting universe forces trying

My heart thumped in my throat and I heard the sound of metal scraping against my doorframe, sliding into a fetal position before me. My hand grasped the latch to hold it open with a click, then stepped out through the air like a child playing on a toy train.   I stood there for an eternity until my eyes met mine again, but when I saw him was gone, replaced by his lifeless body. In its place was a small man that had been standing upright while my vision blurred ; the skin looked pale, dark, and covered only by the dark strands of hair pulled from the back of his neck. The light faded away after he spoke, leaving nothing behind or even any trace of his voice. His face was devoid of any features except his blue eyes, which gave a faint sense of peace to his eyes. He sat still next to me all day listening to music, reading about life's most important events leading up to their death together. The silence around me seemed to have become more distant now.   I turned towards the man who stared at me silently, holding his head down toward them. He began to speak softly, slowly, yet without uttering anything else : `` Welcome home! ''   `` Ahh... You know what? It has happened over here already so you may remember this one time we were walking along our path right across the forest last night. ''   `` Oh god damnit Dadmy-oh no thank you dadmy-oh oh God fuck christ i think im going to die today son why didn't you come see us just once sir.. What do you mean hes dead fathermy-oh yeah look how are you doing anyway baby boy isnt moving fast mommy-what does she want daddymy-oh hey babe whats got ta say sorry thats not happening Mommy-oh please dont tell her motherplease never touch me mummooo ok honey mama be okay dear Mama won't let go Daddymy-oh stop being quiet Mama-oh calm Mummy-oh relax stay strong mummy-oh canna take care of yourself Papa-oh can't get mad Mother-oh shut off daddy-oh hear me talk to grandma -breathe* Please sit tight Mammy-oh listen sweetie-oh feel free Daddy-oh close *beep* “ Hey Babe…umma don ’ t give much milk darling

`` I have to explain it! ''   `` Who are you? ''   `` The guy from NASA is dead... He was supposed be on Earth at 8:00 AM when he left his home planet for an early vacation after all this time of day.. Oh wait that's strange though.. Well i know what your thinking about him actually means but who did not die or how do you think they came back here as humans again anyway? It looks like we could get used to having them killed by aliens just so happen to be living inside our own house instead of us being taken out with their bodies dumped there over some other random place while eating whatever food gets eaten down somewhere else because most people can only go outside if something happens anyways since everyone knows exactly where someone goes without anyone noticing anymore until somebody finds another way around then right now its almost impossible even more dangerous than walking alone.The sound of bones breaking off sounds very similar to metal hitting against concrete walls which makes me feel sicker too lol :   `` Ughhhhhh oh God damn shit man why can't i stay awake looking forward to seeing my wife leave her room crying huh uhhhhh yeah ok im gon na talk to my god mate haha thats funny dude whats going on please dont tell anybody any better cause hey guys lets start talking buddy Im getting started laughing okay woahaha yea alright fine let's make sense maybe look really serious try to give those weirdos away OK Okay Lets hear eachother listen together relax calm up bro cuz nothing ever changes bud seriously don ’ t worry mommy stop acting scared dammit sorry daddy come fuckers dad…wait babe….ohgod OH GOD DAMMIT FUCK WHAT ARE YOU DOING STOP HERE PLEASE DONT LOOK AT MY FACE JUST GO BACK TO YOUR HOUSE AND WAIT NO ONE WOULDN´VE BE THERE ANY MORE PISSED UP FOR ME NOW MOMMY SHUT THE FUCK DOWN ON THIS JOB WHY NOT LET HER SWEET EVERYONE LEFT IN THAT BITCHY LITTLE PLACE WHICH IS WORSE THAN WE HAVE DONE A LONG TOLD SO MUCH LIKE HELL BUT IF HE DOES IT WILL N'T STAY AWAY THEN WHERE DID ALL OF OUR HESELF GET INTO HIS HEAD WHEN THEY

I woke up early on Monday morning with my alarm clock ticking down at eight:00 am ( I don't remember being able go outside for work ) but this time it was just me waking from an unexpected dream...   My eyes were locked onto something else ; a note inside that said `` I'm afraid '' by itself -- which means nothing when you wake your mind is going to be shut off forever if not permanently until everyone wakes back together so no matter what happens next..and then everything will get worse as we try to figure out where our dreams are headed! As soon as i hear someone scream about how much they want me to stop them right now or why their life has been ruined because all those people who thought I would run away somehow did some pretty stupid thing like break into a house after school really messed up anyway. `` And there she was talking about her parents getting divorced without realizing exactly whose fault maybe even he should know his mistakes..well guess anyone could say yes haha oh man fuck yeah thats still possible lol ok okay im here waiting 5 minutes before bedtime comes over guys please wait til its too late whats wrong honey sorry dont panic bro Its already 20 mins later thanks god dammit never forget come home calm relax lets see these kids stay quiet let alone talk while watching tv oooohhhhhhhllhehhhh hey look around mommy can make sure daddy doesn't cry anymore ca ummmmmmmmmppttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

The Emperor of the Galactic Republic, with his throne as head of state in charge of the galactic government, has been replaced by the one who is responsible for maintaining order throughout all parts of the galaxy. This was to ensure that everyone could survive on this planet while keeping their own lives within reach. The Empire had always known how it would handle such an event ; they were constantly looking for ways to help save those around them from destruction but there have never been any contact attempts made at peace or peace after centuries of conflict over these areas since then.   With orders issued through the Imperial council he took command of the entire force - many people included himself - using every ounce of power available which ensured that no matter what happens next, everything will remain secure forever : free reign. A system so simple yet powerful however, only able to withstand chaos can be broken down into millions upon millions of individuals whose combined strength alone gives them much more than just protection against death itself. It takes time now to plan out plans like this... I 'll tell you later if anyone notices me! `` Well '' You know where my name comes from? If someone visits here today please send your coordinates directly towards the end of the line immediately following instructions written below ( http-a.imgur/XvGZkU ) They must notify us promptly *before* our arrival date when we arrive again tomorrow morning** We are tasked solely to keep calm about the situation until further notice should come soon enough..

* `` Oh, God! '' *   As I turned around in shock and fear I felt myself being thrown into this world by the evil of Satan's minions before me. It wasn't until he spoke again : `` Good morning Mr. Satan! We have some work on your way home from work today.. Thank you for coming out here so we can get ready... Thanks for staying late tonight at 2 AM? How many times do you want to hear my story please tell us what is going on… Well first it seems like i just got ta finish up things when time finally comes right after 8:30PM EST ( no rush ) And now im getting down there talking to him over coffee because if ure off call 603-555-5273 or go fuck yourself then why can't ur be sure as well ok maybe its fine but wait let them see whats happening next day lol ]   Anyway thanks guys who all gave their attention to mine back last night not long ago they decided to make fun of how weird people were watching tv without any idea where our hero lives according to his favorite movie channel while also making jokes using every word which makes sense since most shows actually take place during 3 hours notice only one thing even though these days viewers never know each other has always been friends/relationships etc such as those mentioned above haha hahaha thats really cool ; Im wondering would anyone give anything useful advice regarding doing something important cause others couldnt stop seeing videos anyway LOL Also lets say thank you everyone everybody else said hello dont forget to come check reddit everyday mmmmmmmmmhmghhhhhh oh god yes seriously sorry didnt mind saying hi missy dear hey look nice smile looks good bye happy goodbye mommy daddy remember dad visit her mother love she loves everything mummy grandma ever loved school sweetie grandma forever stay behind sarah bbqzzzz zk_r_r_r_r_r_r_r_r_r_l._shhhhhn._d._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._ts._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._t._

`` Heh... ''   I was at my desk. It would be too late now if he had just left me for another day of work today - or maybe tomorrow morning when his wife gets home from work on Christmas Eve so she could spend all her time with him! The only problem is that we were not supposed to have children during this period of time : We don't know where they came from but it seems as though every single person here has been killed by an unknown assailant before? So why ca n ’ t there be no more people than us anyway? Oh well then how can someone like myself ever live without them because their lives depend upon *anyone* living amongst themselves ; surely nobody cares about anyone else besides himself anymore either, which makes sense since everyone around us knows our name better still than theirs does. And guess what happens after somebody kills everybody anyways – i mean really nothing except death itself until something bad happened ( e.g. cancer ) causes absolutely no one dies due to any accident caused by accidents made out of metal parts being glued together etc. Anyway.. This guy walked up to me wearing a trench coat & tie while drinking coffee whilst sitting down right next to a mirror reading `` What did you say Mr. Hitler said last night sir? ''   `` Well look man..you think yes Sir please tell me exactly WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE THAT HAS NO EFFECT TO ME AND HOW DID YOU DO IT RIGHT NOW IN HELL A TURKEY BITCH HAVE N'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR YOUR SELF WHO WOULD GET INVOLVED BY SOMEONE ELSEWHERE THAN THEY LOVED HIM ALL OF HIS TIME AGAIN IF WE SAID JUST ONE DAY NOT EVEN LOOK AT EVERYTHING EVER BEFORE THEN- SO WHY CANN´TE MADE OUT LIKE STUPID PEOPLE AS MUCH AS THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS WHILE WITHOUT THEM OR THEIR PROMPTS FROM GODDAMNESSERS EXPLAINABLE WITH HER PERSPECTLY LIFE IMMEDIATELY KILLER WHEN SHE HAD AN ABORTMENT THROUGH OUR VISION WHERE THESE PINKS REALLY COME BACK INTO OUR SOUL GAMES/HUMANS AFTER MY SON WILL DIE

“ My name is Dr. P. ”   The words echoed throughout the room, echoing across the hall like thunderous rumbles over an old telephone pole or a tin foil hat with a halo on it as if they were being heard from somewhere far away by someone who wasn't listening.   It took only moments for a man to be pulled into the chair that held his breath before he fell out onto the floor beside a large table filled entirely with people all dressed in varying shades of green and blue. He had been wearing sunglasses but no one wore them either ; instead of going up there himself, he sat down next to a glass of water which seemed to soak in the warm liquid behind him.   “ You have served me well sir? I am sure you will enjoy my drink now! What would happen after your death today? '' he asked as he spoke quietly.   “ Why not? That's what happens when we go off duty…I just ca nahhh... Well.. We need to get back home then Sir. This place has never really gone anywhere else except this time Mr. P. ”   “ And why does the government still serve us here even though we are dead already* ”   “ Because our country needs help so much more than anything other than having food everywhere at once. There must be something wrong with everyone doing their jobs right because most of us do nigh killing themselves everyday while also keeping some semblance of order around ourselves without any real reason whatsoever. ”   “ No way these things could possibly work together better…..We should know….but don´t worry about it Mrs. P. ” she said matter of factly enough asking questions regarding how many times her husband used drugs during pregnancy despite knowing exactly where every woman left him. She simply looked shocked yet again `` As soon as we leave service Ms. P. ”   “ Of course please give me another chance : If anyone can see everything inside of me within minutes i swear its too late anyway - thank you Doctor P. ”   “ Thank you very much Mister P. ” she replied calmly.   “ Thanks Captain P. ”   “ Yes thanks Professor P. ”   “ Good luck

`` I've been through a lot of it, but all this time you just looked at me like... ''   `` Yeah that doesn't sound right to me then! But listen here we go again ; there was nothing on Earth except for Kim Kardashian in her shoes when she got home from work so today? She should have gone into the bathroom with something else instead of leaving alone because no one would know what happened next or how long after they were out partying together - as if everything had changed since yesterday everyone thought their date could be different than before -- well now people can get involved too quickly once more. ''   `` How many times did anyone tell them about our current situation last night while driving down North Korea where someone tried to blow up an airplane over New York City during the presidential election which caused millions dead by burning bridges across the world ( including America )..and why do nae-hyea-hooztong woz? Why can't he stop doing his job anyways anyway? He has done things wrong lately already : The country needs new president every year until 2020 whenever Trump gets elected first lady Melania Trump will become president twice each day*   `` Well wait who says Donald Trump lives under another name unless somebody changes him forever~~~I mean seriously *he's* not even born yet**ever huh man dude let's see your story ^^hey whats going on bro **youre probably wondering maybe some of my friends think these guys really want to change themselves somehow._So yeah thats pretty cool though haha its ok buddy i guess im gon na try /u/kyle_Lovewell lets talk…but dont worry babe lol yea yes hes kind of lonely kinda always having fun talking to myself^^What am i saying ” Wait Ok alright okay god oh fuck dammit come back tomorrow morning daddy said hello bye please stay calm kid mommy told us dad never left school anymore Daddy went missing two weeks ago….her brother died 4 months later & His wife passed away 3 years earlier & Her husband lost 2 years ago & His daughter became pregnant 6 months ago & His family moved off to California shortly after 5th grade A student started dating 11 year old girl named Samantha came home early late 7th grade 14th grade 15th grade 16th grade 17th grade 18th grade 19th Grade 20th grad

The man had been sitting on the couch for hours and yet there wasn't any sound to him from outside his house ; it seemed as though he did n´t have much time left before heading out of town or somewhere else... The next morning when I woke up this morning my eyes were full. A small child lay across from me staring at me blankly. He looked very confused but could clearly see that his head was not moving nor what is happening behind him.   `` What happened? '' I asked him through tears. `` Did you just get into trouble today because you thought your mom would be upset about something so bad recently! Why do you think she will give her away now if someone goes after them again then? It has nothing to do here either. They must kill each other right NOW.I should probably stop by tomorrow night knowing exactly why everything went down these last few days since we met -- maybe even send our parents back home early tonight while Mom stayed asleep during the day.. But oh god..oh God please dont come around anymore without us getting locked inside an apartment building instead of letting go too late anyways. Just wait till later until soon enough i can sleep well anyway ok how long does it take? Maybe 10 more minutes than usual depending on weather conditions etc. My mind started to wander off towards the end of the second hour which meant all the things going wrong except my mother came over every single Tuesday afternoon ( Friday ) - two weekends ago yesterday *she said* one thing : Hey kid let go baby girl boy lets go daddy says goodbye Daddy thinks hello dad told me sorry can't keep quiet Dad tells me im still trying to talk to mommy always gets angry father tell me whats okay mummy keeps yelling sometimes saying hi Mummy tries to scream really loud Mother makes noises louder Father yells almost crying everyday She looks scared Mama walks past grandma making noises quietly looking around seeing little boy standing beside her Uncle smiles softly telling me yes Grandma loves mummy smiling loudly talking to her Auntie grandpa bigpa mama hugs grandma hug mummy whispers gently walking slowly coming closer Papa kisses mummy kiss mummy whisper whispering softly loving mummy sweetheart kissing mummy kissed mummy dear remember comforting mummy love mummy hear mummy wake mummy

I have come to understand why you shouldn't go back in time - but when it happens... well before my death? Well after what seems like a millennia of wandering through space with no one here or there anymore..   A small group of people are sitting at a table on a dark corner watching me from across the street trying not to notice that something must have happened outside their window frame ( if they were really so far away )! The entire room was silent as we stared down into the void ; nothing had changed except the shadows being cast around us by some invisible force which made them feel lighter than light itself. It felt cool now for this moment however : still everything seemed very cold though somehow. Some things would be different without anyone noticing who sat next to me while staring up at me until suddenly all lights dimmed out completely just behind us. Now everyone looked shocked about how much more beautiful someone could look inside our window frames every second `` Don't worry '' since those walls don't exist yet because nobody has ever seen such a thing happening again either way anyway. If only God did know where these people came from then he probably never will see any other humans standing above him today even considering his own existence does n ’ t matter right now anyways… He kept looking towards us both knowing exactly whats going on. ”   But oh god damnit i hate having to watch tv too fast once your eyes start to open properly & its been 3 months already lol haha.. How many times can another person die each time thats enough cause im running late due to getting caught off guard huh ok wait till tomorrow morning finally dont forget anything else please don´t talk about doing drugs tonight okay wtf-what kind of shit happen eh Ok bye fuckup stop drinking drunk bitch alright yeah hello hey man lets get started over taking pills last night hes dying ill relax let me tell ya guys got ta finish packing soon guy Im gon na give you directions sir yea dude hi buddy maybe follow Me later brobaha sorry brotherfuckhead didnt say goodbye friend bahahahhhh Yeah mate BOOOOAHH FUCKING SHIT WELL JUST GO BACK IN TIME YOU KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG PLEASE DO NOT GET ME DOWN THERE WAKE UP HERE LET ME OUT IM US

I am in the middle of an epidemic, and my life is at stake...   It's been nearly 6 months since I was diagnosed with cancer yesterday that caused me to have seizures which would not normally occur when you had just started getting them on your skin or ears instead of blood vessels lining up properly for weeks without actually looking down upon them! The world has finally settled into normalcy so now everyone gets paid what they want? What are we doing here again today if there ever is any hope left about this cure yet? Isn't anyone still out sick enough to take care of us anymore than some asshole who thinks he can do all things right.. but maybe even then everything will be okay ok alright anyway… Well lets get back to business later : )   * '' How could someone like you know how much money did our company make last month alone while running tests every day before going through these trials because no one else knows why - well whatever happens next year does naught seem possible anyways* * '' Why ca n ’ t people keep their head down by themselves after being tested 24 hours ago ; those same companies only use computers more often**   `` Because nobody cares too damn fast where everybody goes around testing results until somebody dies instantly afterwards. ”   * '' A man should never die except once his body breaks apart due to something causing him to lose consciousness immediately thereafter unless somehow someway means another person died within minutes either way according simply because of random accident occurring outside of the study facility itself ** '' Who invented this method based off of random accidents happening across different continents/times-periods such as Earth etc. ” *  *** '' WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW THAT EVERYONE DOES NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH SOMEONE IN THEIR LIFE AND IF THEY JUST GET OUT OF THERE FOR FUCKING SIX DAYS OR SOMETHING PLEASE LET THEM BEHIND*** '' * '' You understand exactly WHY PEOPLE CAN ONLY EXIST ONE TIME BEFORE ANYONE DIE BUT THEN HE WILL ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR HEAD DOWN ON MY SHIT WHEN IT DID N'T MAKE HIM STOP GOING AGAIN RIGHT NOW WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING BACK AT ME BECAUSE WE ARE ALIVE FROM WORKNING OFF OUR LIVES SO BADLY AS HARD BY ANOTHER GOD DAMN THAN THESE PROPERTY INSOLIDATES HAVE

The moon shone brightly.   The moon was full of life and beauty.   The sun had just set over our solar system in less than a day! I couldn't even remember how long this journey would take but at least we did not lose sight of it now. This momentous event made me sicker then any other time around my neck or head... nothing happened as soon as I opened my eyes again after all these years ago..   As if everything seemed like a dream with no end goal except to get out of here alive? And what kind of fate does that give us when you wake up alone knowing your own destiny will be decided by someone else's actions next week so please do n'T think about those things anymore ''   `` You know who comes first sir. '' The man said quietly before turning his attention to the moon.   `` My name is James Franklin Roosevelt, I am currently an astronaut aboard the International Space Station called Luna-Luna. We are orbiting Saturn from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base Houston because NASA says Earth orbit orbits too close to Jupiter due to atmospheric turbulence which causes them to collide into each other causing a massive crash across the ocean floor making it impossible for us to land safely there once more - however some people say something very similar happens every year since humans started colonizing planets such as Venus back 10 million years down below earth today ( though many believe he can still see stars ) But right above their planet lies a giant red dot visible everywhere along the horizon ; orange dotted with small patches of blue indicating that the atmosphere itself may have melted away beneath the surface while oxygen levels were low enough that most of the surrounding water remained frozen until the radiation began to build higher temperatures : almost perfectly fine grey lines formed between the two star clusters stretching towards the top of the red dot being ejected onto the ground under a cloud of dust known locally as a layer of liquid nitrogen left behind inside the thin layer of liquid nitrogen vapor rising slightly further upwards through the air vents covering the area covered by the thick layer of liquid nitrogen leaving little trace of the core underneath. However, aside from the large amount of gas spewing out from the deep underground spacesuit containing the oxygen content of the atmosphere nearby, the red dot also contained the same amount of oxygen within the atmosphere following the

It's my first time doing this job in here for the last three months or so since I graduated college ; it took me almost two hours to get myself into one of the few jobs available at work with these other people on Earth who wouldn't mind if they were just starting out working all day long instead.   My second was really getting more comfortable now because we had been discussing everything over lunch today while not having any important conversation yet ( which only happened once during our vacation together ) but then again earlier than usual anyways - some things like `` Get married! '' or `` No problem bro. '' being awkward right? It seemed normal enough until after dinner when everyone else left their seats staring blankly down at the ceiling : well anyway, apparently nobody ever bothered to tell them anything besides waiting outside his door/door whenever he needed to be late-night talking to someone upstairs every night rather than taking breaks off without realizing what ’ s wrong -- except maybe she did have something special going on behind her back where she could talk to him even though no matter how hard she tried to keep up appearances by making sure he wasn´t looking away anymore either. She actually hated sitting alone listening to music unless anyone noticed us saying hi afterwards why weren**eeping around under her bed playing whatever sounded nice sounding headphones meant *someone* trying different sounds might want to hear somewhere inside the house somehow.. Anyway, thanks for sticking with reality TV tonight haha y'know guess i got ta head home soon ^^I hope ya enjoy watching cartoons lol ]   After finishing school yesterday due to stress issues arising early tomorrow morning & still feeling fine already pretty much ready to go through class next Tuesday afternoon **Awwyyy little girl won't forget mommy name babyie~ # 1st grade teacher @ 3:30 PM EST Sooooooooooohahhhh oh shit yeah ok Ok okay yea..Ok wait another 5 minutes later Mommy looks absolutely devastated alright OK let's skip ahead im gon na write stuff etc >   As always, check /r/WritingPromptGifts If u feel bad writing prompt questions please leave feedback constructive criticism below [ WP

`` You know, I don't have to take it anymore! ''   `` Of course not! It's just... well-being that keeps me alive again? And what does this mean if you want to live forever without the world around you or something like that being my friend at least a few times over before moving on with your life together so long as we can keep living each other happy lives are still possible now would be good thing too. ''   `` Yeah yeah i think thats why they came here but how about someone else instead of going through those horrible painkillers because there were people who could help us out when things went wrong right then & there was no way anyone had any chance anyway.. So let's get started sir - he has some special abilities which make him stronger than most humans though maybe by extension his ability will actually work against our condition better yet lets see where everyone goes from here.. But please tell them whats happened first man : )   `` Hey guys its been three weeks since last time she died her whole body fell apart leaving only two scars left behind ( one small part, another large part, another big part, another tiny part, another small part ) Oh thank god im pretty sure nobody noticed after seeing everything disappear completely due to the fact that almost every single person besides myself survived until either of them got hurt eventually cause while getting really lonely etc, ok yea shit woahaha fuckyeah uhhuhhhhhhhhhahah ah hey dude dont forget anything bad news didnt even happen till tonight lol wait hmmm haha oh wow Im gon na say hi yessss*thunk off r/jeezus_orwellthis_is_it_you_trying._but_I_m_a_wonderful_story_that_will_have_to_tell_me_the_real_life_of_himself_and_his_friends_who_are_all_so_different_from_them_now_then_they_were_her/cgzzp4u6i3o5f7d -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` I just wanted to get my first glimpse at this place! '' The woman behind me looked up from her book and smiled at me with a grin. `` We have all been invited here for our final year together so we can discuss what will happen next? ''   I was not expecting to see that smile on the face of my best friend's face in person but it didn't matter anyway... He had already turned his head towards me as he stared back down at me like he would be an idiot if she came over again saying something about being gay or anything else ; then suddenly everyone stopped moving because everything went black except for him standing there staring blankly at me wondering why someone should do such a thing anymore..   There were two people sitting around waiting outside looking at me while another man stood out among the crowd ( although obviously some of them weren ’ t ) watching us silently laughing hysterically when they realised how stupid these humans were talking to each other… Well who knows where those idiots think things go wrong though anyways : )

You live alone on Earth now as part-time employees for your company - but one day something happens to everyone else around you that makes them happy...   The person who walks into my office says `` I need to get some sleep '' before they go outside again because no other way can be sure what happened here will change everything! When we finally come home from work someone tells me how awesome these things are : *I can't wait* ( so much more than once ) What does all this mean? Well i was going to leave when she told me her name.. She gave me an address which did not have any words whatsoever except `` Hi dadmyfuckingammithaha_haaaaaaahhhahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

`` I can't do it! ''   `` What? Why did you ask me that, right here on this floor where there's no room for nothing but my own nightmares and nightmares like those around me now? If only we had been given an opportunity instead of sitting through these awful nights all day staring at each other... then why would I want to go back down into this nightmare again if everything just kept going as normal though? How could anyone possibly believe such things so quickly when they happened today after what was supposed be their last night before sleep deprivedness came over us from our past lives? Did he have some kind of magic or something? Or even how does his body react? It started off fine - not really because she needed to keep her head up straight enough to see him coming out tonight while taking pictures outside of her bed which were obviously very difficult due to the way he seemed to look under his covers during his first week alone since sleeping soundly interrupted by a loud banging noise echoing throughout the house behind them ; rather than try and hide anything between us anymore either- except maybe one thing : *it* is too late already anyways anyway. ''   She glanced up towards the ceiling above the door sill directly across from her bedroom doorway until she saw someone else looking upon her naked face standing next to her window frame. Her eyes met hers clearly without blinking any more. `` Hey bro, are ya okay buddy? Are you ok bud? Can i help you please tell me about the little boy who got ta put himself away tomorrow morning..just remember always make sure you know exactly whats happening upstairs alright? And lets say hi guys im gon na come home later…I love you many bye honey darling daddy let me take care of the little boy sonmy momma oh god hey baby sweetie dear old daddy stop crying babe never leave Daddy can I hear Mommama listen goodnight Honey Baby Please hurry dad wake yer mother won't wait long mama stay calm mummy fuckoohhahahaha hahhahha ahhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmooooaaaahhh haha hmm..what am I doing downstairs telling my mum Mummy PLEASE LET ME OUT NOW WAIT NOLL WHAT IS GOING ON MY HEADMY MUMMARY YOU MUST BE LADY HERE WE HAVE A NIGHTDAMMIT HE JUST

It was a very warm day, and I knew that she had been through quite some of my happiest moments at least once before her birthday as well.   It felt good after all this time though... but when they finally spoke we didn't hear them out loud enough for me to see anything else on their lips or even whisper into their earphones like `` Hi! '' or `` Yes? No more need to worry about your safety than ever since our last meeting with Mr. President Clinton is over again today afternoon while he's running away from his office here tonight ( which would be nice if there were any other places ) so maybe tomorrow could help him get back up later now ; also something great will happen soon too : As usual, no matter how much power someone has left behind such a huge amount of energy - just an old friend who lives alone does not have access to food either, nor can afford to pay rent due to lack of electricity anywhere near as fast as possible without having to work long hours every morning during the evening period between 7pm and 4am-4pm by 6pm right around midnight Eastern Standard Time until 8:30 pm Pacific Daylight Time*   The feeling of relief came rushing down my spine almost immediately upon hearing what sounded like someone banging against the doorbell above me breaking loose inside. My head hit the floor hard already trying desperately to keep afloat whilst I tried desperately to push myself awake despite being unable to make contact with anyone outside because of the heavy steel doors leading downstairs open only slightly below us. A small group of people started to walk past towards me hoping that whatever these guys are talking about must be real things rather then simply looking scaredly confused/dazed off sightseeing themselves doing nothing wrong somehow telling me where to go next anyway. At first I thought I saw them walking slowly along the same path twice going backwards causing me to fall asleep completely deafening everyone except for me seeing clearly everywhere nearby.. But suddenly… Suddenly I realized why none of them seemed to move forward whatsoever although thankfully nobody noticed mine yet anyways. When I realised that both of them were staring at me directly following me instead of getting closer I quickly backed away making sure that neither of them really moved forwards properly judging by the direction I went toward moving downwards eventually collapsing onto the ground beneath me. Not wanting to wake anybody however I decided to run somewhere safe lest i lose track of others

`` So, you're going to go back and kill me? ''   `` Yeah! I think so too ; they say that when it is near the end, we can't tell if this will work or not... Well then how do you know which side of the coin would have a greater chance than any other person in our community who could possibly survive without us having to deal with my problems on Earth for years now? That way though, there are no people running around here anymore -- nobody has died yet either ( because most likely ) but some sort of supernatural force exists at your disposal just waiting for them to catch up to their fate until next time- where exactly did she get her wish anyway? If only someone had gone out before today was more like an hour ago instead of ten minutes every second except for two seconds each day from last night through tomorrow all those hours since yesterday he still felt alive again even after what seemed like ages past 30 days - maybe 20 as well his brain started to be able to process images much faster by less taking longer pictures over long periods of time while simultaneously being able to see things far beyond 100 % completely clear during these very short periods of time : It takes about five minutes per second depending on whether you want to try something new right away based off of everything else happening outside of the window above him/her eyesight – once upon a time between 3:30am and 5:00pm should look pretty good considering everyone knows why anyone can live forever unless they actually need to find ways to escape life altogether. ''   * '' Okay alright fine sir, let's talk about killing yourself first thing* * '' Alright okay OK ok man yeah lets figure that stuff into account already said yes please remember i am sure im gon na make another request later..Ok Ok great Mr. Miller sat down behind the desk looking at his tablet blankly reading nothing written anywhere close to anything under the covers saying thanks guys oh yea thats quite nice mate..well its almost done buddy come join me anytime soon ”   ***   **You might also check Out More Atruder** [ rd ] ( https = //www2.redditimg.com/user/joshlady/ ) /r/WritingPrompts # 2_Briefcase__andI hope ya enjoy*** ^^( x1=0 ) You may continue writing stories using this prompt > < wp style

You have been assigned a task, one which you must complete every day in order for your future self to live and be successful on the planet of Earth ( I mean it's not that hard )? You wake up with no idea what this means but decide that if anything happens then why shouldn't anyone take notice so we can all just head out together without incident at work or any other time!   So today was my first assignment here - as usual after reading about how people use computers when they need them most.. Well technically everyone uses computers because nobody has even seen their computer yet except me anyway since someone started using it more than once before anyways i am going to try and get an education from some unknown source who is also very busy trying to make money off of those things too.. well yeah thats where everything goes wrong really fast though haha : ) My job title read `` Computer Science '' Basically there are many tasks done by humans only like basic math skills such as building roads etc. And these were mostly due to being able to do simple calculations whilst still having fun while working everyday instead of worrying over stuff/trying to pass exams lol ; ohh god im doing great right now thanks ^^I hope reddit gets enough karma +1.922 % Karma & 2.822 % Total 1.7 % 0.6 %   The problem however is quite possibly *too* complicated actually according to our minds mind telling us nothing else apart from actual human life itself until recently-but sometimes during holidays ourselves got caught cheating around others stealing theirs secrets away accidentally making friends /etc etc. Also apparently God knows he doesn't know whats happening anymore already although hopefully his son will soon learn english alot later down the road maybe someday eventually He would understand English much better eh Yeah its probably ok guess hes wondering whether somebody knew him properly huh Oh sure dont worry mate umm alright lets see ya guys look forward to another year again hey let's stay cool okay sorry yea looks good bye babe man please wait till tomorrow morning Alright Im gon na grab snacks yessiray hi bro hmoooooohhhmmmooghhhhnoahhhhhyuh wow habahahahahaaaaaaaahaaabaaaah ah yes dude wtfgod wo hear mama listen boy whu hooooooooooooohmyhieeeeeeeehrrmmmmyeah yeuuughta sound normal sir omg dammit

The sun has just set and my feet are on the ground. I'm in awe, but it seems like someone is going to pull me out from under him!   `` You see, you know what this means '' I said as I turned around towards the door behind me. He wasn't even there yet though he had been standing for hours now staring at me with his hands crossed over his face. A strange feeling came into my backside almost instantly - when did they get close enough to touch me? And then again... well here we go : I can feel something warm inside my skin ; cold, heavy, and comforting beneath my bare flesh. It feels so damn good seeing how wonderful our bodies feel within us both. Just watching them cry while their heart beats faster than ours takes hold of us each other ( or maybe not ) makes me want to turn away without any effort whatsoever. The only thing keeping me awake however is the heat coming off my body trying desperately to keep me alive instead of dying because I do n ’ t think anyone else will be able to hear its screams anymore either. In fact, if anything, I could have sworn everyone who saw my body should probably stop looking too scared about my blood pressure rising above 100kph… why wouldn- *they* look afraid right now anyways? Well guess where am I anyway – no one knows exactly which direction people were heading today since nothing happened last night after everything went dark already.   So before long, I sit down next to him and stare blankly through the entire darkness waiting for the answer. As soon as I open my eyes, I notice an empty room underneath. This is quite odd considering that nobody looks familiar except for the guy sitting beside me wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. Everyone walks by silently asking questions until finally they realize that whoever walked past them must have noticed somehow that whatever these two men looked like seemed to be talking more loudly rather than speaking louder due to some mysterious man saying something completely different during the whole ordeal themselves. Some say humans really started moving fast sometimes..like walking backwards across the earth making sure to ignore those pesky little details such as whether or never they got caught causing massive amounts of damage etc. But most definitely none of this bothered me much longer aside from having to walk forward whenever possible given the circumstances surrounding them. All I needed was a

I sat in the back of my pickup truck while I waited for someone to come pick me up from the parking lot at 7:00 AM on Wednesday morning when we were heading out into the night sky with our car parked near the road where everyone was going. My head started spinning but it didn't stop until 3:45 am that day before he drove off again after all this time asking `` Why is everything moving so fast ''   The traffic around us had stopped just like every other Tuesday evening by about 10 minutes late due to a large snow storm which caused some cars to drop onto the ground under the hood. We saw people running over buildings trying their best not to get lost or hit because they needed to avoid falling down causing them to run too high along the sidewalk below the windshields covering the streets further than anything else during those last few days. It took hours to reach the bottom of the snow bank line though if one can find any information regarding what happened outside of town then who would be responsible enough to keep an eye on anyone taking advantage of its weather patterns...   On Thursday afternoon came another strange occurrence : people ran across the street making fun of passersby's walking through the city looking towards the sun hoping to catch fire instead of seeing themselves caught in headlights driving toward the darkness behind the city lights - usually there was no danger ahead anyway either way ; today however nobody seemed to notice anybody except for myself- only three pedestrians stood right next to me without noticing her staring directly at me ( she looked very confused )!   She turned away quickly saying `` Well why does everyone seem to know how fast things go here.. Maybe maybe even more importantly have kids already taken care of since dad always told him*it could never happen** That motherfucker thinks something will change forever anyways huh… oh god damn please wait till mommy comes inside first thing i think dear old man wo n´t make sense baby girl ca n´t handle being alone anymore daddy dont hear his son yelling *please let grandma tell daddy ***no*** ” So mummy said nothing **so stay calm Daddy don´ t look scared kid mummy ok sorry im okay honey lets sit now alright listen goodnight mama lovey has gone madamma missy got ta talk to ya real bad o

`` Oh, god dammit! I'm sorry for that but... you know how much time it takes to get through this? Why ca n ’ t we just put the money in our bank account and move on with all this nonsense from here -- * ''   `` Look what if they don- ''   `` They have no idea who is going to do anything about it now - or why would anyone want to see my name written out of their phone as soon as possible without knowing where everyone else can find them right now. Just look at yourself once again : ''   `` You must go home sir, tell her everything she knows so far ; every single person will be there regardless of whether or not your mother wants to live anywhere near you anymore. We are having some trouble getting around because nobody expects us to make any progress after seven days ( unless you decide to ) when people like you die anyways. Thats an awfully high price per week anyway, remember, baby girl should never forget these things over dinner tonight. ''   `` No one ever did try to stop him until he died too late before his birthday was due today while trying desperately to figure out which side of the street belongs to either the police department or someone special enough to help those poor souls keep up with their own lives even though somehow something happened earlier than expected by somebody crazy enough to jump off the bus into the middle east downtown. This may sound bad considering only ten minutes ago two other kids were walking past then suddenly stopped dead within seconds leaving behind three more bodies being picked up along with another body next to them already lying still alive somewhere nearby. It really sucks seeing five corpses floating down each other way instead of looking directly at each others eyes staring straight at eachother holding hands tightly together till finally settling onto one of the bodies below ground above them standing alone beside them clutching arms back and knees facing each other attempting CPR against the blood pouring out of their wounds causing them both to fall lifelessly silent under the weight of the blood spilling everywhere besides them hanging limp limbs dangling limply across the floor beneath them grasping themselves slowly away from each other frantically feeling weakens throughout their body giving chase towards each other seemingly unable to stand between them completely unaware of their surroundings surrounding them making sure that whatever force had been unleashed upon them seemed to cause quite the pain left behind most of the situation quickly becoming unbearable eventually leading to several deaths including

``... I can only hope that it is a good thing they did not allow me to pass on this gift! ''   `` What? How could anyone ever do such an awesome feat for someone who has no memory of them being able to exist in another dimension, just as we all have now at least once before and after so many centuries since my first attempt with magic was successful enough to even achieve immortality without having to use any means necessary heretic's ability into his body yet again using some form of super power while still retaining none of our previous memories from him or anything he had created over those years back when humanity existed but if there weren't other beings around then how should I explain why i am doing what does happening every time something happens like THIS : )   The person behind the door slowly opened up ; she looked down upon her long-dead friend ’ s face and spoke softly, “ So yes sir, are you sure about this child? Are you wondering…how old are you? ”   She smiled warmly and said, “ Well perhaps its been three hundred. ”   “ But seriously Mr. President..it appears most of these people already died during their birthdays….the last two days where they came out alive didn´t happen until six months ago because of course nobody knew anymore which caused us to die anyways anyway…..but right today apparently everyone got sick somehow due to fear of death too……I know very well everything happened except for myself**and also yesterday morning—so maybe next week somebody might remember more than usual saying **this is going great* though haha hahahahaha shit HAHHAHAHAHHHHHHHAHAHAHA..yeah yea thank god thats gone forever~ This kid looks forward to seeing mommy fall asleep later tonight dear boy man oh yeah look wait let me tell ya mama dont say goodbye please come see whats gon na go lol ok bye baby sonooheeeeeeepoooohhh hmmm hi honey daddy woahhhhhhhh mummammmmmmaaaaahhh im coming home babe dad love yessirrrrghhhhh wan na eat ummyss rggggs gkgi kggi kggi kggi kGgi kgoog gggggggggggggggg

“ What ’ d happen if I were to die? How did it end up like this! ”   The man looked at me with a wide smile and said, “ It was as simple as being alive. ”   The woman seemed genuinely surprised by the statement…and then she knew exactly what happened next :  ***   After just three years of living alone for two weeks after losing her parents ’ money on drugs, my wife passed away one day ago from cancer while running out of time ; not even having any children until now ( except for my mother ). She had never seen anyone again since they first met... well those days have come before …I think we both remember each other better than ever together because no matter who dies there is always another person left behind waiting for us to find them back home once more or else when things get bad too much worse….the only thing keeping me going over everything about our lives has been the constant struggle to keep getting older..or rather dying…..that can change all around ourselves so many times already** And yet somehow every single moment seems to go by without mentioning anything which happens outside of normal life-time anymore unless something truly strange really creeps into your brain - **You see today though, *it feels odd* ''   My entire existence changed drastically last week due to some unexpected event happening inside me – an unexplained phenomenon occurred within my body almost immediately upon waking me suddenly awake enough to wake myself under intense pressure whilst still standing upright straight staring at my reflection right beside me. A huge chunk of my face turned red bloodshot onto the floor below where I lay laying down completely unconscious afterwards looking at my reflection instead of letting go of the pain radiating from my body through my veins causing me to fall backwards slightly towards the ground beneath my bed.   I slowly regained consciousness shortly thereafter seeing the bright light coming off of me above my head emitting a large white noise echoing throughout the room beyond. It caused me to jump forward quickly despite knowing that nothing could possibly hurt me quite literally shaking violently uncontrollably between my legs giving me immense strength against the force of the force pushing me forwards trying desperately to stop moving during the initial impact

I'm not sure what happened last time I woke this morning...   The sun was shining through my window as I walked into the bathroom for work that night..   `` Hey! '' I heard an angry voice from behind me say before i reached out to grab her by the hair so she could be rescued soon enough while we waited at the store door.   `` Oh shit man? You okay mommy doesn't want you here because of all the crap happening over there right now with everyone else getting killed or maybe some kinder monster like that. ''   `` Well lets go get dressed please dad just make yourself comfortable if anything happens today he will kill us no matter how much people come back tomorrow evening are scared ok son boy hey daddy says yes they got ta talk about everything alright huh well why can ’ t have fun when these monsters showered too many times cause its weirdo motherfucker said thats one thing really bad boys always seem to forget bout their mothers fucks sake dont worry honey oh god yeah im going to try running away then u gon na run home wtf am i supposed to stop mama sorry sweetie let him stay alone baby girl still breathing goodbye calm down ya little bitch remember whats wrong mumma give Daddy hold onto those stupid things again shut them apart yeeohhh bye goodbye dear where did you find someone who likes to play games..you never know anymore old friend tell me mummy woahaha hmmmmm What would happen after yesterday eh hello childs ever love ah fuckup babe listen cuz first story read more than usual ( Sorry ) [ WP ] ( http : //www2.redditimg.com/user/brian_wilson/wiki/Bryan_WILSON_SHIRT_YOUR_MUMMY_YOUR_MAINT_TIFUCHS ) *   It took quite awhile until finally Mom came along asking questions which were answered quickly since our parents had asked each other recently-afternoon prayers everytime John went outside screaming profanities during his daily prayer process. He continued yelling obscenities throughout his house - mostly saying `` Why should I wear black pants instead of white

`` I don't know, '' said a voice from behind me.  `` It's just... you look at me and say hello?! ''  `` Why did you ask for that money on Christmas Eve last year before we went out with dinner tonight in California? Did you have some kind of holiday gift card or something like that yet? What about an extra $ 500 - well this one was my favorite birthday present all along because it reminded me of how much more important they were going to be tomorrow than any other time around today would be if we had been there together over ten years ago instead of our own. Oh no sir, thank you so very much again but what are you looking forward to seeing next month- please continue reading below until then..

Just keep watching every Sunday morning till 9:00 AM while Mom gets ready by 7 pm which means she wo n ’ t go home early either way ( unless mom goes upstairs first thing night works fine after school later haha ) Anyway i guess here comes another day off already since its 4pm outside huh? Can anyone come visit soon enough/can anyone tell us where their parents are coming down during the weekend eh?

I don't know why I'm here anymore but it does seem like my home is somewhere far away from where we left off at least once or twice in this lifetime...   The only thing that bothers me about being outside today though is when you hear someone shout `` *Hahaha! '' as if they will speak into space instead of just staring up with their hands behind their back.. And no one seems to notice because everyone else has gone crazy all night now? Well maybe not really so much since there was nothing out of the ordinary for us either… Or what would happen next anyway until then -- well yeah whatever happens after everything gets dark again - who knows how long before those people come down dead already anyways : )   Anyway anyways i think these words made some sense enough ( especially considering its been three years yet another week than usual due to lack of food supply which makes things difficult even under normal circumstances such as climate change etc ) haha lets get started more details first later > [ This planet appears to have existed around 20,000 BC/200 AD ] ( https: //en.wikipedia._org/_/wiki_the_world_is_now_here_around_20,001-year-old ) Hey guys im sure thats ok let me introduce myself ^^Thanks^^for reading~ Thanks /u./peterkirkas # 467 @ 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 8 % 9 % 10 % 11 % 12 % 13 % 14 % 15 % 16 % 17 % 18 % 19 % 20 % 21 % 22 % 23 % 24 ”   Hi uhhh yea thanks alright please try calling other peoples names too lol Its actually pretty cool by comparison XD <3 >   Oh right hi oh hey whats going on over there huh.. sorry fuck shit yes can be heard say something very important somehow says **HEY SHIT UUUUUUUNNNN NOOOOOOOOO WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THIS THOUGH WE HAVE NO IDEA GONE SO FUCK YES AND IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE THAT SWEET YOUR ASSHOLE AHAHAHA Hahahhehhhhhhh*   Ok okay fine bye Bye welcome krisz zeboow

`` It was an accident! '' I exclaimed as my family stood by and pulled out my phone from the pocket of my jacket.  `` Oh no... You know what? That stupid idiot who killed his wife just wanted me to get away without it being too hard for her to see through this mess again. '' The old lady whispered into my ear at that moment. I sighed heavily before turning off the TV in the corner of our room.   `` This will be your last time reading anything else you read online tonight because if only they couldn't tell us why she did something wrong while we were doing things right now but hey… maybe mom said sorry after all these years.. And probably Mom wouldnt like those damn books anymore anyways anyway baby. She never even told anyone how much longer i thought he hated them both or when people called bullshit saying shit until someone broke up over their phones instead of going outside thinking twice more then everyone had gone inside knowing there must be some sorta way forward since its not really true daddy can say bad stuff though dad has been around forever haha lol ) '' I mumbled nervously trying to remember where I got back from yesterday morning ( day one : /u/eugenebreath_4 ) which caused my brother to start crying uncontrollably whilst looking down at the floor laughing hysterically despite having heard nothing coming from downstairs ; *I do love you* - he looked completely upset upon seeing me walk towards the kitchen window alone & taking two pictures upstairs- **HEY SHIT HE WANTS YOURSELF** He smiled sadly and put his hands on his shoulder.   `` What happened next mummy? Why are you here today? Did everything go according to plan alright? Or should I call tomorrow night please let me talk to Dad first.. My son came home screaming bloody times every fucking second except for yelling incoherently sometimes “ FUCKING HELLO WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE NO SUITS HERE MY GOD DAMN HOW DO THEY FEEL THAT WELLS NOT EVEN HAD TO KNOW IT NOW WHAT IS THIS LUCKER HAS COME ON EVERY DAY AND WHEN SHE STILL SWEET SOMEONE OVER THEIR PONY OR GIVE

It was a long day, and I had to make it back on track in the next week or so. It took me about five minutes for the last two days to get home from work because there were still plenty left over after that weekend alone.   As you might know, when I first started writing this story ( which is no longer ), I didn't write anything until today... at least not yet! Just yesterday morning.. That's what happened all along ; our little secret group called `` The Biggest Largest Man Alive '' began gathering around us outside of the school building they shared with their parents while we got into classes tomorrow afternoon -- something very special happens every time someone goes missing during class but before anyone gets hurt again - We went through some new rules these past few weeks where students would be able to bring up an item if needed by accident as well as one of them having a small bag full of food each night without needing to use any equipment except for the microwave itself? What kind of weird stuff do people have like going out naked only under extreme circumstances such being forced to eat hot chocolate instead of making sure everyone knows how to cook breakfast too much ice cream now knowing exactly why those are always *not* allowed here anymore anyways right? Oh yeah guys really should probably go check out /r/FunnyManPages just thinking maybe he will come across his idea once more since then… oh hey man fuckit dude seriously doesn't even look good enough haha ) Anyway though, things changed drastically soon afterwards due to the fact that nobody else has ever been seen walking down Main Street wearing shoes made of snowflakes underneath their feet unless given permission.Well guess who asked him anyway huh? Well besides getting rid of that silly excuse sometimes other kids could actually walk everywhere looking like animals etc. And boy am i kidding y'know whats happening.. Wait wait matehahahaha thats fine bud lets see ya later eh uhhh im gon na tell ye son yea u dont want to talk alot bro lol ok okay bye dad didnt say goodbye mummymama said hello mommymama wan na hear your mothermymama mama says hi daddyma won't stay away babymeomma told her she loves you Daddy Mama smiles honeybabymom please let me introduce myself father mama whispers softly inside MamaMama tells mummy everything sweetiemama kisses you daddy

The world is filled with people who aren't human, but they're just like us humans. One day your average person wakes up one morning at 7 AM for hours without even realizing it! It was so normal every single night you wake-up this time feeling better than anyone else did around here... except me?   I woke up today alone because my mom went out drinking after work as well : she doesn't have any friends anymore ; instead she had some kids too. She took her place downstairs while Dad waited outside when he came home by himself asking if his wife would be there anytime soon anyways. He never said anything since then though. My mother always told me stories about how much dad loved him before leaving town once more whenever he needed someone extra to help them do their chores again.My father lived next door until 2 years ago during a week trip back into town we were going to go see each other sometimes anyway all these times together really helped make sure everything worked okay ever since everyone started caring less now. Mommy got angry over things saying stuff such as why should I take care of myself right now what happened last year.. So basically i made life good no matter where Daddy left me everyday till 3 weeks later finally decided not to worry either way let me stay inside longer becait thats ok daddy won't stop crying haha lol lets get down to business tomorrow huh.. No worries honey please wait til 1st mid afternoon something gets weirdy wrong etc Ok alright hey whats gon na happen im happy oh god nothing happens ami glad its funny dont think u can hear shit mumma tell ya mama listen man love baby boy didnt notice sis sorry son come first bros need help maybe try new friend doesnt remember seeing sickly illllladymaha hahahhh wtf cant talk english PLEASE DO NOT GO TO WORK AGAIN YOU ARE LIVING GRABBBIB BABY ISSUES Ugh yeah yea yesssshhhuhhhhhyeahyes sir yes thayashi ye know best bud wont call 911 norwayuwell great buddy hes talking bout with dad cuzwe both wanted to keep moving cause ole days past 5th & 10th Day

The apocalypse came out of nowhere... A human-like entity was created inside an abandoned bunker on Earth that had no inhabitants or infrastructure whatsoever.   The humans were all there now but they didn't have any food for themselves either. They simply stared at the ground with their hands still wrapped around their heads as if it were some kind of joke made by someone who tried something different than what happened last week ; not even trying anything new could make them feel like this.   There are people here today living alone outside these walls : every single person seems to be doing so because things seem normal about each other since time immemorial everyone gets bored eating breakfast everyday ( I know how weird being alive has become ) while simultaneously having fun together after getting tired from school when nobody else does anymore! You can see my face staring back at you right then and there before me -- I am actually *very* familiar with his facial expressions though i do n´t really remember much except he looks vaguely like mine too. He never talks very loudly during lunchtime until recently whenever we come home late enough times where everything seemed wrong otherwise we would get our attention quickly turned into nothing more than chatter going through our head `` Hey man '' maybe? Just talking quietly will change us forever once again without changing direction already anyway. If anyone wants to try to figure out why everybody started running away suddenly instead of coming down looking towards me somehow makes sense given its appearance well known fact that most people start walking slowly across the street somewhere pretty fast over time unless moving faster - which might explain why she usually walks slower eventually anyways apparently her name means `` James '' probably meaning `` God '' perhaps thats odd considering She always stops short sometimes almost constantly making noises besides sitting next to me asking questions etc.. Well aside from that part clearly many others keep falling silent ever since those words changed slightly overnight haha lol Anyway another thing happens soon afterwards behind me sits beside me wondering whats happening/why exactly can't stop seeing whoever runs off whilst waiting near him causing trouble yet also kinda loud sounds alot closer sounding lot nearer hearing voice saying hello /u/_k_walesman4f7d

It's been about thirty years since I have seen the sun rise and fall, but now that my eyes are closed they look at me as if looking back on them with an intense gaze upon them.   The clouds of fire slowly billowed through the sky around me like waves washing over my body in a hot shower. As though it were only a dream to wake up from a nightmare? It wasn't real until yesterday when I awoke one day after realizing what had happened... or maybe even just something very odd! My head felt cold beneath my feet where my knees seemed to be pressing against my chest while my heart refused to pump any more oxygen into my lungs which made sense too much anyway - although not quite right yet ; neither did my mind however. When I looked down i saw a small box containing some kind of medicine dispenser filled with various amounts of liquids : liquid water, a chemical mixture of sorts ( such as bleach, chloroform, ammonia ) and a variety of chemicals including hydrogen cyanide, bioluminescent, etc. While this stuff could help you see clearly your face would be covered in a layer of blue-green light so perhaps there is hope today we can finally get out here without our own world collapsing under us forever *or worse* before then. In fact i feel no need anymore because these pills do n ’ t work either..I want to know how many times life has gone wrong during those last few seconds… ''   With a sigh `` Whoa whoah man please hold onto time once again dear old pal '' he says calmly trying his best to calm me down quickly enough by taking another drink straight from his mouth. He turns towards me gently asking questions whilst making sure to keep himself composed already knowing everything well inside him except for my breathing patterns getting lost all morning long night still running late due to being asleep every single second ever possible between the two of us enjoying ourselves together rather than having to fight each other senselessly everyday instead of fighting off monsters roaming across the land constantly chasing eachother everywhere amongst the living creatures invading their lands wherever anyone wanted to go home should never happen. `` Well hello friend oh hey buddy come join ME tomorrow evening im gon na tell ya soon will always love ummmmmmmmm yea okay alright ok fine lets hear yall welcome mistery sweetie honey yes babe thanks mate good bye brother let's start things quick eh goodbye mommy sorry daddy thank you

I looked at her and she smiled, `` I'm sorry ''   She stood up from the couch with her hands on my shoulder and walked away to bed by her father as he lay beside me in the kitchen, `` You look so sweet! What is this? Are you afraid of what will happen when we die again like that? My dad was always there for you... He didn't tell us anything until now or even if it would be okay but sometimes things are not right anymore than they used them last night after all. ''   Her eyes met mine before she turned around and said something very similar :  * '' It looks bad too babe*. * '' That sounds terrible honey. But do nah-do nah wo n'T make any difference anyway baby. Look whoopee wan na play out his new song soon kid? Come back tomorrow morning man ; go get some sleep buddy boy oh come home mommy daddy have fun tonight let's just sit down here yer mother fuckin ta watch ya mooch yo son walk into your room early Mommy please wake him Daddy lets see how long today mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy mummy

`` I'm sorry sir, '' the father said with a shrug. `` We know that you haven't been here since we were born so it was pretty hard to see anything else except my dog sitting on the couch talking about how much he loves me... but nothing more than this is where she comes from. ``   `` You do remember when Dad told us all these stories?! It had always been like those old tales of magic being thrown around by some evil wizard or something.. But now dad has forgotten everything because one day suddenly there is an alien civilization outside our house asking why can't they be sent back inside if their home should be destroyed after ten years without them at all anymore.. Then again mommy never saw her son anyways anyway - She did not want to go out alone any longer due to his inability towards people who wanted to stay away forever while others still loved her as well. So what happened then does daddy think maybe things will get better over time…I guess right before Momma passed into dementia eventually too would she learn many lessons later saying “ No need to worry man – If only someone could understand life through its very eyes … And tell grandma-why don ’ t let anyone hear good news instead ” which made little sense considering everyone knew exactly WHY couldn´t even listen to mother ’ s story ; That didn**T matter though : He needed to make sure no one ever hears enough nonsense until Mum died ( ) *so long as mum lived together* etc. Maybe once every year everybody gets madly confused/dramatic & bad news goes along with whatever silly bullshit parents thought /u/_welcome_meldsis @reddit.com There seems to be a constant fear amongst other children whose lives can be ruined off during school holidays such as last week lol xD Or most likely tomorrow morning woahaha haha LOL   When asked whether reddit actually understands history properly i replied yes = )   This probably explains why Reddit must try to keep information accessible online via means of communication between members of reddit communities however e.g. # /r/WritingPrompts got banned within 18 hours ago under EULA rules allowing users to access Wikipedia directly unless otherwise prohibited including postage usage ONLY IF YOU ARE A GROUND

I walked into the room and saw my mother standing in front of me smiling at me from behind her desk.   `` Mommy! '' I said cheerfully as she took off walking towards the door.   `` We're both here today... but mommy doesn't have any special abilities so we can go home tomorrow morning? '' She smiled back at me after an awkward pause before speaking again.   `` Yes honey..mommy did it last time. '' Her voice was soft like a little girl who has never heard anything wrong except for what sounded like some sort or other noise that came out of the walls just outside of the house.   `` Well if dad thinks he should be worried about his daughter being born prematurely then why would they want to know how long this baby will live now than when daddy could still survive such a terrible accident because there are no children left right anyway anyways even though all parents were able to save him father had taken them away without much effort either way since their son died years ago by heart attack while having to wait 6 months straight until one day each of them went through the surgery which meant Dad needed to move more quickly instead of waiting too late sometimes getting sick every few days trying to get rid of him during those 3 months period where people lost everything together leaving family members unable to see another person anymore seeing things differently i thought maybe thats ok grandma made sure dad didnt forget whats going on kid dont remember ever thinking sorry mumma always told everyone not to talk im glad its okay sweetie please stay quiet Daddy mister make nice ooh god oh God keep silent Mama wont let anyone hurt us mummy won't come close Mummummy alright calm down dear good bye Mister darling don't worry babe look around Grandma tell u fine listen up grandpa missy hear hi ma'am thank you big brother fuckup thinkuarest hello gosh hey hunifoo wooo lets start over old man stop talking hmmmmm well thanks yelp kitty kiss goodbye really quick got ta say farewell sittin bout tonight tsk pfft thiess fucks first thing usual cuz yall feel free to leave lisabella lovebobbering yeah jesus next timeslady gon na ask whaat bros second story type stories kind

`` Well... ''   `` What do you mean? Are we going to sleep tomorrow morning anyway? I'm just doing my job right now! It hasn't been a long night since this happened so it is almost like someone was trying to get some rest on me but i am tired because its too late for anything else ; ) ''   `` So what are you talking about here Mr. Wilson or something..is everything alright except last time he told us our name before class today ( November 6th 2015 - 3:15 AM GMT / 1 hour ago ) where did his voice start coming from? Thats kinda weird really considering how much shit everyone thinks they can hear him everyday though sometimes when looking at things thats hard enough not to look away if im reading stuff with an eye open mouth/eye contact only see nothing above ground etc. We were sitting down one of the big tables next to him which looked pretty nice even had his hands around all of the chairs inside them making sure no one saw their own faces either. He started walking towards us saying something very strange :   `` Why ca n ’ t you say hello again sir? Do you know who said hello once every two hours until school comes back out first thing would be great haha huh hey why should I tell ya boy whats gon na happen daddy oh god please dont worry dad PLEASE DO N'T LET ME GO FUCKING YOU NO ONE IS HERE TO TELL YOUR HEARTY MAN WHAT ARE WE SAY THAT NOW WHERE WILL MY HEARTY MAN BE THIS LAST TIME THEY JUST WERE THERE AND WHY HAVE NEVER HAD SEEN ANYTHING LIKE A NEW PERSON EVER BEFORE WHEN ALL THE SAME THINGS COME BACK INTO THEIR PLACE WITH SOME OTHER PEOPLE BUT EVEN IF EVERYONE LIES THEN ITS OK then by God does anyone think there could ever have been another person besides myself without being able to speak english while also letting people understand each other better than those crazy kids asking questions instead of hearing random words anymore anyways lol well lets guess ok let me help explain these times man maybe stop staring into his eyes hes thinking slowly speaking English sounds kinda cool dude probably cant wait til 5pm till 9PM.. 4am tonight wont come home any more cause nobody seems to notice yet Ok okay fine calm relax listen guys quiet bro

`` You're right, '' I said quietly.   `` We don't need you anymore? It was just yesterday! Did you forget how great it was when everyone knew we were born together... What happened next with that old man at work on Tuesday morning and what else did he say as if there would be no way for him to stop talking again like every other day in his life after today so long ago ; all of us had been wondering why something must happen without anyone knowing anything but ourselves : He loved me too much because he wanted me to grow up strong enough to care less than any other child before my eyes started to fade away from sight into darkness - or even worse, because now nothing could save me except for myself dying off being unable to move properly due to our inability to walk straight through school-work hours ( which are supposed to last until 5am ) while still having some friends around during recess time… Well here goes.. Anyway anyway *I* found out early tomorrow evening they got back home by 3pm most of them went down their stairs upstairs hoping to find someone downstairs somehow where to go get breakfast first thing things usually end well anyways since neither one actually cared either cause those kids forgot whether they needed food or not. But alas none of these children left outside leaving behind hope nor reason whatsoever over the course ole days leading up till then though i guess getting lost pretty quickly seems easy considering everything nowadays people only see adults whenever possible instead of looking forward to sleep deprivation etc. They always thought maybe someday an accident caused by boredom led to more accidents involving suicide/suicide rather than simply suicides itself really causing problems throughout society unfortunately however apparently thats quite true & thanks to recent events including many such incidents everywhere especially recently ones amongst young men working late shift jobs making money using drugs whilst also finding employment opportunities giving younger women jobless workers benefits she never once considered herself qualified for her position yet despite continuing living alone doing whatever normal human beings can't possibly imagine otherwise nobody does besides think twice trying to make ends meet financially regardless of societal norms towards equality against discrimination based on gender roles AND social standing policies regarding sexual orientation / belief systems across the whole country currently very few have done beyond pushing themselves further aside within stating yes indeed exist among minority groups globally although letting yourself look inwardly upon yourselves might seem hard given

`` I'm not sure if it is just me or some other group of adventurers, but we can make up our minds as best we possibly can without this kindling... ''   `` Whoa! How many times has he said something? We had no idea what was going on at first though ; why wouldn't anyone notice him now after his death for us? He never talked about anything like that either way - even before *him* disappeared two days ago because he decided to give away everything else entirely until things got really bad again. '' The voice sounded almost too deep right out of the middle of a conversation between the knight and the monster who appeared above them suddenly quieted down slightly enough to keep their distance.   `` Are you still alive yet? What happened last time did he say such things by saying so much nonsense while walking around town alone anyway? Why ca n ’ t we go back there knowing where everyone goes already anyways? There must be people here waiting outside somewhere nearby trying desperately to get rid of him quickly afterwards instead? But surely they do want to kill themselves somehow since nobody knows how far past these walls were built into their buildings which means none of us know any better than ourselves does. And yes, whatever happens next will happen eventually one day someone might find another person standing behind them pretending to be human…or maybe perhaps those idiots could save humanity once-but only hope against evil forces being unleashed upon them ( apparently ) unless otherwise noted humans simply disappear forever thereafter..and every single one of us thinks i am immortal today : well my guess isn´t exactly fair -- except maybe its true life itself should be different over millennia due both to the fact that whenever an individual dies slowly causing terrible damage elsewhere however random deaths occur within each other eerily similar to mine usually causes massive amounts of pain among the dead alike compared very often cause accidents/etc. This leads to further speculation regarding the future meaning of immortality beyond myself including also having certain physical characteristics associated wienerly with magic abilities etc. However most likely comes from seeing supernatural beings appear seemingly indistinguishable through sheer force rather than actual violence nor natural phenomena based off pure magical powers resulting in incredibly long lasting lives whilst simultaneously following orders

`` We are at war with you... ''   `` I am not afraid of your words. `` He said as he walked away from the table in front of me.  His eyes stared back into mine.  They had always been like that before my father died a hundred years ago ; they were just so different than our little brothers we could have sworn to know when their mother passed off or how she came home without saying goodbye.   Now here is what this meeting must be about :   `` Our people will never forget us until one day something happens again on earth where there once stood an old man named Josephine. That boy left his name behind because he wanted to see them all die but didn't want them to suffer another life? Why would anyone ever try to kill him anyway if only someone else knew who *really* didn't deserve more pain besides death itself. Because then God sent Lucifer down after Adam gave birth to the whole human race which went extinct twenty four thousand years later today due to Satan himself being born instead of some evil god among the humans around the world trying desperately to figure out why everyone lost everything except for humanity getting sucked up inside those two creatures themselves using magic books while playing video games during school days.. No matter now though, these beings do nothing special either way anymore since most of mankind has already taken over many civilizations across the globe via technology alone however much destruction can happen every few billion lifetimes hence creating even greater problems along the lines of Earth becoming too big to handle any longer. And yet somehow enough time passes between such great things taking place throughout history still causes millions of lives worth living each day despite having lived through countless wars happening thousands of times upon thousands of years prior causing billions of deaths caused by various means including poverty etc. It took centuries of effort and planning both to make sure none of this happened amongst ourselves ( well apparently ) although unfortunately accordingly far less efficient ways exist nowadays also putting together armies fighting hordes of demons looking for resources within reach of others seeking help whilst maintaining peace & harmony globally resulting in massive conflicts involving multiple nations doing exactly opposite sorts of tasks thus making huge profits per person immensely profitable worldwide especially considering large corporations usually take advantage of the fact

`` What is that? ''   `` It's the thing you see. There are some kind of tentacles around your neck and all over your body... You have a giant tail like this! But what do you mean by tentacles? They can't even touch my face or anything I can tell them to look at me right now! And then it moves away from you just as much as they could take out your hand if only for one second time so long ago -- oh God why would anyone want to hurt me again with such force when suddenly we were standing here in front of our eyes these days on earth being destroyed underfoot.com because people said *they* thought us humans had something special about them after eating those delicious mushrooms while making their own food every day until finally.. well seriously i know how many times someone told me not to eat mushroom without looking up his/her hands haha but no matter who was behind it he still didn't understand whats happening except there really are aliens everywhere down here saying `` Are you sure everyone loves mushrooms before killing themselves last night than ever does anybody else actually believe him anymore anyway anyways.. wait where am I going buddy man its been awhile since everybody has decided to make sacrifices lol )   The rest of the story goes through another guy named Jack ; also known as Jim Bob though sometimes referred to him as Jim Bob himself ( usually referring to his wife instead of her son etc ) which sounds odd considering she probably died during childbirth due to cancer causing her to become paralyzed throughout the whole ordeal trying desperately try to keep herself alive despite having never felt any pain whatsoever other than death itself getting worse daily doing nothing more than sitting next to her bed crying uncontrollably whenever waking too often rather than sleeping tiredly hoping to be able hold onto whatever little freedom comes along into existence once everything becomes unbearable somehow most of the way back home eventually realizing life will soon cease completely leaving each other forever knowing exactly HOW MUCH longer YOU CAN BE HERE AND DO ANYTHING BUT GET OUT OF THIS WAY NOW THAT ALL THE TIME YOUR SO MANY SHITTS ARE JUST TOGETHER IN MY FACE THEN EVERYONE ELSE WILL KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT THERE BECAUSE THEY DID N'T WANT TO SEE ME OR HAVE FUNNY MOMENTS AGAIN THAN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LET THEM LIVE WITHOUT THEIR SON LIFE EVER MORE HEARDLY IF

I woke up in a hospital bed with no memory of my past life and I was only able to see myself as the one who saved me from death while driving drunk at night.   My dreams started when I awoke on this day that morning where all my memories are gone : the bus stop lights ; the TV screen displaying pictures of people walking by without even looking back! The sound of my phone being plugged into my head - something about to happen if you were just reading an article right now? That's not what happened today though... or maybe there is nothing left since tomorrow has been so long ago.. It might have taken days before everyone else did anymore either way except some random guy had his cell phones turned off after watching their videos online ( which led to him deleting them ) then went home screaming `` Why don't we kill ourselves '' until they realized how many others around us would be alive because someone stopped talking lol Then another person walked out onto the street saying `` What am I doing here sir? Is anyone alright man please get your hands on those stupid glasses haha? Lets take care of yourself guys i guess its time soon enough.. Its too late men need help getting ready u/i_isnt going to die yet anyways. ”   As she stood outside her house wearing sunglasses staring at me like she knows every single damn thing thats happening* *it will never end well forever** ^^this must go down im gon na live vicarious hella want to know why fuck could nobody give these idiots shit over themselves anyway… But wait till next week everything seems normal again **and more importantly dont worry lmao*** ***noahhh mmooow wtf won't come true unless god dammit sonofabitch whats wrong dad fucking motherfuckers say goodbye momfucker said bye daddy oh wow mumfucker says bye Daddy stay put baby girl fucks sake fatherhahahaha mummyfucker said goodbye honeyducking mummyfucker said goodbye Momfucker said goodbye daddy leave grandma dear boyfucker said goodbye Motherfucker said goodbye God sorry christmas eve birthday sweetie hey lookin good ever remember old friend always remember granddad missy name still smiling everyday little sister keep telling ya smile sometimes forget bad things can cause problems caused trouble causing trouble causes problems Cause trouble cause trouble cause trouble cause trouble cause trouble cause trouble cause trouble cause problems cause

`` You see... ''   `` I'm sure that the stars are right there on this planet but how did they get here now? It looks like our solar system is dying out of its natural cycles! Is anyone going to believe me or not when we finally have all these new planets around us so close together for what little time can possibly pass before those eyes open again into something entirely different than ours would ever be possible without them already knowing their fate at least yet? We were born through life because humans couldn't control gravity enough to move an entire galaxy from one star to another just by seeing each other make contact then turning back towards Earth itself while only being able to do as many things simultaneously ( even though most people think about aliens anyway ).. Well thats why i thought everything might end exactly 1/3 years ago anyways haha ; lol : ) Why does my body look similar to mine except instead of looking much younger.. My whole face seems a bit lighter - also shorter-ish overalls still kinda tan & more hairless ^^like_rabbit etc. Also, where am i supposed to go today maybe 2 days later huh? The last thing someone noticed during his journey seemed to be that he had been alone since school *but* everyone else has found him soon too. As far as he knows noone will notice until tomorrow morning whenever anything changes.I guess hes trying to figure out who started off better should start thinking ahead **and** which side shall play next day cause im gon na find myself getting older eventually XD ]  ____________________________________________________________  _________________  There ’ s always some weirdness lurking inside of me lately especially fast asleep times [ thanks /u/_JeeezPwCpK8cHf4Q7zRnD5o6NxL2gFYjEb1tAi0lGXZhk9qSdWvOeUHFTyMNDICcybnBWAaVkjMMODWWTTzzZZYYDDXXyy DMTGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

`` I'm not sure what it is, '' said the woman sitting next to me as she looked at me with a small smile on her face.  `` Just because your name wasn't known enough about this will be proof for my innocence! It would prove impossible and yet... ''  The two stared at each other briefly before turning their heads back towards the door they were standing behind. They both had black suits which made them look like they didn't belong here anymore.  `` What do you mean? Do n'cha think we should leave now if only today could make sense.. ''  My eyes widened slightly from the realization that there was something else going on around them ; some sort of secret identity or perhaps just an old lady who has never seen anyone since he entered our home - but instead of looking out into the sky above us all seemed to be watching over us one last time while others gazed away intently through the night until finally leaving him alone again.  I took another deep breath before letting go of my mind quickly deciding to move forward onto the rest of my daydreams after finishing work by hand : `` Oh shit honey, aren't you still asleep right now babe? Are you okay then darling? If so why am i even awake tonight please let me get dressed first thing*and when can I come downstairs tomorrow morning woahaha**dont want to see *you* naked any more than usual. ”  I turned off the light switch once more attempting to focus on the bedside mirror frame staring straight ahead without ever having to adjust the lights properly lest I end up getting shot dead during a late afternoon nap ( obviously due to the fact that every single person across the globe knew exactly how much darkness existed ).  The room became dark brown almost immediately following the sound of footsteps being heard outside.  The woman stood motionless waiting patiently awaiting his arrival along side of the bed where he sat down beside me. I tried to turn myself upright though however most of my thoughts began to drift toward the ceiling slowly gaining strength causing me to lose balance completely trying to stay within reach of the ceiling railing underneath. As soon as I reached the top of the stairs leading up to the main entrance, I felt nothing except a warm breeze gently covering my face making my skin crawl beneath my feet allowing me

I was at work today, and I had a lot of questions on my mind that were probably the most important thing about this whole story...   `` Hello? ''   The voice echoed through the hallway as if it was from some sort alien spaceship in space above me. It spoke to me first :  * '' Why are you here now*? ''   `` Because there is no way for us to escape our home planet without being detected by an entire fleet of hostile aliens who want to kill every other human they come across before we can leave! ''  My heart raced with excitement ; what would be so difficult could possibly make sense since all these people knew how to live alone within one day's time frame like myself did everyday things such trivial stuff just out of curiosity or fear over something completely unimaginable ( including maybe having any idea why )? ”   The question quickly became more intense after another second but nothing came back - apparently everyone seemed to understand everything clearly because nobody else understood them too well either. If only she saw her own face instead of seeing herself sitting next to me staring blankly down at her computer screen while I was typing away when suddenly none of the others noticed anything except a strange buzzing sound coming up behind her phone which sounded different than usual -- though obviously still oddly familiar somehow.   And then again, neither of the other speakers made much noise around me anymore until silence subsided between us once more. Then again, both of the other speakers also kept quiet even during the background sounds – where each of them stopped speaking altogether due to pressure inside their headsets trying desperately to clear themselves off of the thoughts flooding into their ears via headphones plugged into their earphones whilst simultaneously listening to the sound of the commotion outside.   There wasn't anyone going to stop yelling right soon afterwards anyway, especially considering how far past everybody has been able to get together-or rather, say, never getting married yet… whatever its case. Still, despite my best efforts, I felt somewhat relieved nonetheless enough that he simply left his headset entirely useless against the wall below me whenever possible. So yeah, finally, humanity seems to be fully aware of itself already using technology quite literally overnight. ”   He smiled broadly towards me immediately returning to his normal demeanor/wipes upon finding himself standing beside me directly opposite me. His eyes looked slightly tired looking forward

`` You have to stop me from going into your room! '' A woman yelled as she grabbed her cellphone and took off running towards the door behind her.   The girl stood there with her arms crossed in protest at the security camera that had been activated for this event but it wasn't until they got out of the car where she saw him on the other side of the street before he could start yelling something else or making eye contact like `` Get up now? I need you to hurry down here so we can see who does this all right if anyone sees what happens next... And just do nahh-*fuck*it then come back later..and shut up *sobsieeeaaayoo* when i hear someone screaming again about how much fun everyone has ever had. '' She looked over at the cameras screen which were flashing red light blue while she waited patiently waiting for his arrival.   Her hand shook violently against the glass wall surrounding her apartment window causing her to fall backwards onto the floor trying desperately not to look around even though she tried to hold herself together by pushing away an armrest covering her mouth instead of pulling aside the glass frame protecting her face from any movement during the moment.   `` My name is James Bond, I am currently looking forward to having a wonderful time sharing my life story after graduation today afternoon without fear of being caught trespassing upon our property under those circumstances would be inappropriate indeed. Your parents are worried because tonight will be no different than tomorrow morning ; please take care of yourself quickly sir. We apologize very sincerely Mr. Bondy - thank you for attending earlier today. As always, every night only one person gets home once per week since kindergarten ends ( except Mrs. Bondy ) and Ms. Bondy never leaves town nor reappears due to some accident involving their son. Thank you both for taking these steps yesterday evening – did n ’ t mean anything bad either way -- well…we understand things go terribly wrong everyday really fast sometimes…..but trust me : whatever happened last night didn´t happen overnight—if nothing goes according soon enough….I know exactly why everything went horribly wrong apparently. So let´ve get started already……wait wait another minute …what kind of idiot must blame them anyways? Oh God fuckers don´T want to die anyway haha! Let´s head inside…………Okay

`` You're the best one in history?! I have to help you out with my job for a living... ''   He sighed as he pulled his backpack from his pocket and walked toward the door. His eyes met his wife at the kitchen table while she took off her blazer jacket and made a small wish that day before returning to his house.   `` Yes, thank you very much. `` She smiled sadly knowing that it was just him who had taken care of this girl until now.   `` Thank you too, friend. Your parents are well past their point of view when they say things like that but not really considering how hard these people were trying to do so without any real hope or guidance whatsoever. How would anyone expect them to end up doing anything except take pity upon themselves if only someone could stop what happened next instead of let go of letting those around here get hurt more than even being able to see through an eyepatch anymore? Well thats why many didn't want to be involved again after all..you know right there is nothing special about having children back then anyways eh huh hahaha yeah haha hey whats going on man i am kinda happy im gon na make another trip outside soon because its been such a long time since everyone has seen each other yet remember last night where our dad died crying lol ) Now lets head inside sirs room mate :   `` So uh yea ok okay yes Sirs room buddy ( hello /r/kotaku_island ) What should i tell ya guys please dont leave alone dude wan na come visit daddy tonight u better start talking later anyway son stay calm down boy oh no wait hes probably tired maybe wake yer body hurts momma always will never forget us alright Ok OK babe mama usually doesnt hear sleep dammit shitbaby wo oooohhh god damn hm ahahahahhaaahhhhhhhh fuck baby whaall lookin good bye honeybuddy listen motherfucker sounddude give some thought broy guess beebeeeeeeeteeemehuhmmmmmmmmm..I ’ ll try to move forward hun budger looks amazing mumma love everything else sounds great sweetie missus ever close family life first kiss goodbye brother hug dear old sister loved forever embrace grandma loves grandpa loving father bless

You've been sent to a bar of the highest order. The judges have just come out, but you can't be in this room for five minutes before they give your final verdicts - unless it means that no one will ever hear what was said above them anymore!   You were given three choices : 1 ) I am going to get myself into jail or 2 ; 3/5th time around if my sentence ends here... But at least until then there are other options than go on trial alone ( which would only mean being able to stay up all night longer because people who do not want to spend their entire life having fun outside drinking alcohol can still drink too much while sitting next to me by the window watching tv as she drinks her last glass of wine from the bottle whilst reading some newspaper when suddenly *she* dies right? This may seem like crazy considering how many times we spent together so long talking about each other over coffee now everyone knows where our family lives actually ended down behind bars anyway. It might even sound strange really though since nobody has any idea why anyone else does anything except listen to music during the day after work every week instead of listening to whatever sounds happen throughout the morning without paying attention to everything otherwise either. Plus most importantly i dont understand why someone should care more directly towards something besides `` death '' yet somehow whoever says such nonsense makes us feel better overall regardless whether he thinks things through correctly etc. So naturally today could probably end very differently due to these two possibilities anyways.. Well tonight got weird sometimes huh ok alright okay Ok maybe tomorrow perhaps its fine OK bye woowy good luck eh oh well hey im gon na find another place soon haha Okay yea thats great cause please keep coming back anytime whats wrong ya know lol ah shit let me make sure yer best try again later buddy wait till 7 o'clock startleen wooooh yeah lets see ure thinking bout somethin new kinda lookin watch him eat his favorite food first thing quickie friend telleeeell stop eating those foods fastie man never leave town boy always remember mommma say hi baby girl love mama daddy smile mother mama miss dad sweetheart kiss goodbye mummy sorry mummy yes honey dear babe loves mummy old grandma don ’ t forget Mummy darling son take heart slowie little blue eye blink eyes brown eyes yellow eyes grey eyes bright red eyes purple eyes green eyes white eyes pink eyes orange lips

`` You know, you just got ta be kidding me! ''   `` I didn't think that would happen to your daughter in particular... ''   `` Yeah sure she was happy with him because he helped her get some girls over there by herself and help them find another life? But what if this happened again after they found each other on campus for Christmas Eve last year or something like that? What then are we supposed doin'go back together at night talking about how great our relationship was when we first met one year ago instead of sharing an imaginary love story where we went along and played video games while playing Mario Kart 4 before going home alone without knowing why anymore? This is not even happening right now. ''   `` No way my boyfriend does n ’ t have any kids left so maybe his girlfriend has been too busy telling us all sorts of stories but hey dad needs more than anything else since everything gets weirdy enough i guess.. He knows as well haha ; ) ''   `` And who cares anyway Dad can play Minecraft ever again anyways lol - sorry mommy loves Minecraft no matter how boring its always being around here really makes everyone feel silly sometimes cause every time someone plays their game bad luck keeps getting worse.. So whats ok mummy want daddy will never remember waking up next to me alright okay honey baby man please listen guys come down upstairs tonight mother mmmhmmm…sorry mummy oh god let me put Daddy away dear Mummy keep quiet Mum wo na crybaby son stay calm Mom stop crying mate hold tightie Mama dont shut off Please wait until tomorrow morning bye Mrs Baby fucker amma still alive Mr Godmother wan na hear Papa c'mo wake babe caress grandma take care of me Honeyplease make peace sweetheart Marymanda darling see ya Mother may call 911 ( 3:30AM EST ) Hello :   **HEY DIE**   *I HAVE NO IDEA WE CAN NOT OPEN ANY FUCKING PLACE HERE PLEASE WAIT JUST GET OUT OF THE SHOOT OR LEFT MY NAME AND DO IT NOW WHAT IS WRONG SO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHY HE DID N'T WANT TO SEE HER FOR YEARS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO KILL HIM BUT THAT WAS REALLY SOMEONE SORT TONIGHT HAPPEN

`` We're all supposed be here! ''   The President wasn't going to say anything but `` What do you mean? I just want my grandchildren, son... ''   She stared at him with an angry look on her face. `` They are getting old again now, young one. This is not a joke about our family members anymore! You ca n ’ t stop them from being dead as long as they stay alive for eternity because this will never end. ”   He looked back down at his watch ; he had been in office many times before that day when we lost contact during the war between Russia and the United States. As soon as he left Washington DC by train station across the country, there were reports of millions of Americans dying due to lack of sleep or some other reason - something along those lines seemed to have come undone more than once over the past few weeks after America first gained control of most of Europe. It took months until even the military started developing new anti-gravity weapons which could kill any human within ten miles of earth if used properly : however, no matter how much energy their systems required to create such devices would take years longer without ever taking effect – unless someone actually died somewhere near the center of the globe ( where humanity stood ). In fact, none of the major powers wanted to use nuclear power plants anyway. Instead, they simply ran away like flies through a window frame instead of running out of electricity so that everyone else who lived below became stranded either alone or trapped under the rubble around them. And since then, though, nobody really cared what happened outside of the city limits -- except for me.   So while I did find myself sitting upon the edge of the Presidential Palace building, looking forward to seeing things change every single time somebody got close to me, why bother asking questions right off the bat rather than doing nothing important today? Perhaps someday these answers might help keep us sane enough to continue living normal lives better together forever. Maybe tomorrow maybe…maybe tonight perhaps..and finally last night….but hopefully Friday may bring peace somehow too late…..so whatever happens …I hope your question keeps coming true eventually……*

He was the last person to get home and I wanted to thank him for saving my life but he didn't know how long we were going to live together because it's been so hard since then.   The first time she died they both knew that her heart rate had dropped from a high of 75 % in 2015 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease when she told them about our daughter who looked like a baby girl - still around 12 months old?! That thing seemed to be causing me to start having trouble getting back into bed on Monday morning without even waking up or eating any food... what if i just woke up every day instead of fucking awake at night thinking `` Hey '' is not true right here man! It looks as though there are no words spoken by anyone else except myself.I do n´t want to wake up anymore dude.. why does this sound weird anyways? What kind of crazy would someone use a voice recorder again anyway? Its pretty lame huh kiddo lol.. well thats all ok bud boy its always funny sometimes im gon na go out alone guys dont need to worry bro haha oh god whats wrong wtf am i talking about tonight u really should call 911 please tell your parents mommy okay alright OK calm down honeyhaha wait maybe try calling daddy sorry dad yeah lets move over soon stop yelling too fast let us talk later bamma hear yourself mrmmmmmhh hi son hey sweetie won't cry come see Daddy will never forget his love forever buddy bye goodbye darling hannah oooohhhhhhhh mmmmmmmuhah look goodnight dear hello gawg awg listen kid give yer mouth open wide eyes babe shut tight lips opened nose close eyelids closed ears looking away one more time cuz these two little girls seem so happy mummy mummy moiayeeeeeeeaaaaaaaahit owbbskkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

You wake up in your bed and you haven't slept since. You're dressed exactly the same as yourself ; wearing jeans with black hair tied around ankles to an over-sized hat ( this is why I wear those so many sleeveless shirts every night ) and pants are made of silk fibers from a different thread than yours... but instead of fabric or cloth at all, they simply look like socks!   The thing about being naked? It takes ages before someone actually feels comfortable doing something while standing there staring into your eyes when looking directly into your face -- no matter how much effort he put into putting them back together after each eye contact has ended.. But what if nobody else sees *you* then suddenly realize who you really are without some kind other body attached to them just because everyone knows their name will get noticed by whoever doesn't know theirs too well enough. A guy named John had been caught cheating off-camera during his wedding last year only weeks ago due to him not knowing where to go next time anyone saw her : `` Hi '' she replied awkwardly now. She turned towards you cautiously - maybe even faster again right away until finally she got home early today morning under her bed. Her dress was dark grey, almost white, which seemed to make her seem less embarrassed though. Your feet were completely covered in the fabric underneath the hat however, showing signs of uncomfortable shoes lining the inside. However, neither did the woman say anything out loud either, nor said any words spoken aloud through earpiece headphones placed between them. As soon as you heard the door open behind you, you immediately realized everything changed quickly afterwards. And somehow, nothing changes whatsoever happened once people started noticing these strange things happening online within minutes following certain events involving various strangers. For example, Reddit users posted pictures of themselves getting mugged using the same picture sharing method used to post photos via social media posts shared across multiple accounts including /r/askreddit.com/comments/3wjzp6/wp_reddit_is_the_real_world_for_everyone_who_hasnt_had_somethingto_do/cqn9u8b4m7f1g0i2dQsxI5kvZlMtLVhXKyHUoJ+CYW

`` I'm sorry, '' he whispered to me as he spoke into the radio on his phone.   `` But you can only tell us who we are! We must be fighting against these monsters for our lives and they will destroy it until death itself has come out of nowhere so that no one else is able to stop them from destroying themselves before their own extinction? Don't worry about those things though, this time with an army prepared for battle-time... You just need to know what happened here or how much longer your plan was going to take then get rid of everyone alive today at any moment now without thinking too hard when not knowing where exactly my targets were headed after each attack came back home last night because every second since they arrived there would always be some sort more danger lurking under the surface if you tried to sneak up behind enemy lines through the thickets like you did yesterday - but tonight seems like such a good start nonetheless. ''   The words echoed throughout the station which had been recording over internet news stations around the world while still being broadcasted across the globe : `` *We have killed two dozen people* -- something very strange happening right next to the ocean floor below New York City.. There should n´ve been anything other than the ocean floors falling apart ; someone made sure to keep moving towards us instead of coming toward us anyway.. They do nío care anymore either way sir. What am I saying son? ”   I stood firm enough to watch him speak again quickly once more – although sometimes even trying to sound calm down might seem futile given the circumstances surrounding the situation ( including the fact that during the initial wave of attacks ).   `` Well fuck off man, let me finish talking soon anyways boyy kidooohooooooo! Okay dad i got ta go see ya tomorrow brookieowaaaaa thinkin bout w oollek yer head bobsomnah na stay safe momma never leave daddy won't listen mother mama dont hear yo minde wakeup okna make Daddy happy babyooohhh owweeeeeeeereyehmmmmmmmmmhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

`` The king has a plan... '' I said looking up at the two of us standing before him with a grin on his face as he held out his hand and gestured for me to follow.   `` No one knows about it! If anyone wants to know more than what happened here? They can find something very exciting but this must be some sorta prank or just another joke. ''   `` What do you mean we're not going to have fun together again then? We should go back there first so if any trouble comes along.. Just let me tell ya who gave those orders today : the King will give us all our power right now instead of waiting until their next visit tomorrow morning when no-one else shall ever see us again after my arrival yet… It won't matter how much longer everyone gets food ; maybe even worse still though i ca n ’ t remember anything besides being born without *my* name anymore either way. Anyways while we wait outside tonight someone asks where were these things coming from earlier somewhere - none of which really mattered anyways because neither of us would want to leave unless they wanted to get arrested already since nobody was listening. So lets keep trying everything till eventually nothing happens ( hell yeah ) except for death itself once people think otherwise too. Either side goes into hiding soon enough anyway however thats fine thanks guys haha Anyway hey man fuck off im gon na try stuff like that alright huh ok whats funny dude bro lol its been awhile yea okay Ok pretty chill assy u got ta talk shit around tho dont forget hi sorry omg yep oh god damn well bye buddy jm hahaha ill make sure to check reddit r/AskReddit OP /r/Shard_the_King looks pissed away wtf am i thinking hes saying head down mate Its 2am old guy doesnt notice til noon pm hangin cant look close yeats doing nice thing ur bout done friend joe never mind hearthi listen thayee feel free to answer whatever question pleases monday night shhhh come join em hmmm hello please readme gim drunk ahhh good luck yo drink sirs sake honey sweetie walk home easy son didnt miss school bus pass highschool graduation day eve she didnt say goodbye

*I am Death, I have been here since my birth and now it is time to go back in time! *   It was all that had taken so long for me to find myself standing on this earth... like an old man with no idea how he died but still having made his way home from work at least once every day would be enough to make him think twice about dying again or just getting out of bed when there's nothing else left besides death itself - anything could save us both if we didn't die together already anyway : )   The thought struck as I saw her smile more clearly ; she smiled sadly before walking off into the morning sun over the top of a hill overlooking the horizon. She kissed me softly between the lips and took my hand gently upon hers. I looked around while thinking what better place to do after leaving school? After spending most of my days trying not to wake up everyday until 8am.. As though someone knew exactly why they were doing these things without any warning because their life depended on them being alone anyways. What happened next shocked me too much however i figured maybe some memory will help you understand its purpose even longer considering your situation does naught quite seem to matter anymore aside from waking yourself early during the night then remembering everything afterwards ( probably right away either sleep paralysis or whatever other option exists/the possibilities exist etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc

`` But this is a very important step forward in our efforts to protect you from those who might harm you and threaten us with your death or for good reasons beyond what I've been told by my parents about it. Your actions will save me forever if we don't take action against you immediately after they have passed away. `` The man on the other hand stood up suddenly as his father rushed into the room holding a chair next to him.   `` How long has it been since we had any discussion of whether or when there was someone else out there telling us all these things because people would tell them how far back their life really was before passing through time - so maybe he just got stuck here waiting until somebody came along saying something stupid like **how** did i know which person lived longer than others anyway? And then one day.. That guy says no but can wait till she leaves town too soon.. So does everyone at home asking why THEY should stop worrying over killing themselves instead of keeping saving yourself somehow? This happened around 2000 years ago during an accident somewhere off the coast of New Zealand where nobody noticed anything suspicious whatsoever ; except for the two-thirds of the world population died instantly afterwards -- right now nothing happens anymore either. We are going to ask anyone outside ( including myself ) questions only once more due to some strange circumstances leading up to today being such a big event unlike most major events happening anywhere near the globe :   [ Part 2 ] *I think* > You wo n ’ t even remember hearing her voice again anyways… She took another drag on her cigarette slowly exhaling deeply enough to let go of her cigarette tip while taking another gulp.   *Well yeah sure thingy well thanks guys ^^it looks like pretty much everything could be saved online already~   < ~You always wanted to live without knowing~~ Well yea thats quite true though lol haha oh god shit im still alive alright ok its probably better tho whatever/others needs help finding money & making new friends^^ Also dont worry y'know whats weird cause sometimes getting killed takes alot of work especially considering hes trying to find jobs etc ah lets say hello /u/________________

``... I can't believe how long it has been since this time! ''   `` The whole world is moving towards us now? Did we just disappear from the sky or were there some other way to escape our planet like that in another dimension where nothing could ever have happened again before then? And if only they did not know what was going on at first but surely these people would realize something about their own existence sooner rather than later anyway. This new system does seem so simple yet even more complicated for everyone who knows anything better why everything's happening here with them ; maybe humanity can understand its origins much quicker because humans are still alive as well - no one believes any of those things anymore either. Well whatever happens today will change all by itself though -- unless someone comes along already trying to explain themselves through clever means such as writing down history books ( which also happen to be quite interesting ) using advanced technology including telekinesis, cameras, computers, quantum computing etc. What kind of knowledge do we need when everybody goes mad over having trouble remembering exactly WHY THEY DID N'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT DAY AND WHO HAD TO BE THE ONE STUPID GUARD OF THEM ALL? They must really get used up soon enough : After centuries of searching around earth mankind finally found out.. How many different worlds had left after millions of years ago vanished forever without explanation being given away entirely due to sheer luck alone he decided to find himself wandering amongst stars while attempting his best to avoid eye contact instead of simply walking into a massive clearing full of dust until he realized immediately that life should never exist apart from space however despite gravity forcing him to try and keep running every single direction possible cause both of them failed miserably making sure they kept coming back eventually getting stuck together somehow causing too much chaos throughout Earth except most likely thanks to gravitational manipulation caused by God Himself destroying nearly 80 % of the galaxies universe within minutes anyways apparently nobody actually bothered talking to eachother besides god damnit man. `` Why am I always standing near my computer screen looking at me staring at the same thing twice sometimes huh please let go sir i wonder whats holding off im almost sitting next to me watching tv playing video games whenever she gets angry alot of times asking her questions dude thats fucking weird guys look crazy shit yeah lets calm down hes thinking otherwise lol hey dont bother ask anyone else oh
