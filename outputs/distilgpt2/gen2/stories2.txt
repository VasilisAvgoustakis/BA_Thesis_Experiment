A man wakes up at the doorstep of your house, with no recollection of what he was doing or anything else that would have been possible without you having him kill himself! You're not sure how much time passes since this happens but there are rumors circulating about it happening all around town... What is going on?   I woke early one morning feeling oddly awake as my eyes drifted over to the door frame where I had just stepped through..and before I could react even more i noticed something strange behind me - something familiar-like. It seemed to be moving slowly towards the doorframe above me. I froze mid-air so I turned back toward the mirror staring into the mirror again ( which looked like someone actually saw them from somewhere ). `` Whoa whoa here '' exclaimed the voice outside of my bedroom window ; if only they were still alive after hearing their story somehow now apparently nothing has changed except for the fact that we didn't die while standing naked whilst screaming some weird sound off our phones being plugged into speakers within seconds because maybe another person will hear us saying whatever sounds really coming out of our ears when suddenly everything went black*   The next thing I knew I heard footsteps approaching closer than usual *I know its fine then why ca n ’ t these noises keep getting louder until people get quiet enough* sounded exactly right inside my room though other voices seem to come rushing past each other making noise too loud otherwise things might just turn round once everyone starts talking loudly instead of trying to talk clearly anyways **Oh god oh God OH GOD WHAT IS THAT THING ON MY DINNER RIGHT NOW WHO ARE YOU DOORS LIKE FOR YOUR SELF** ***   But never mind seeing myself running away any longer & always looking forward to watching every scene unfold itself soon afterwards ^^this does make sense^^ haha yea yeah thats kind of funny im pretty sure her father died 2 months ago lol well whats wrong dude she said u doodt think Im dead already scared shit fuck nobody ever dies till mommy killed herself.now wait listen guys dont worry dad didnt realize death doesnt mean daddy wont see anymore cause look down onto anyone living alone forever mkay ok lets go take care of grandma okay alright let go grab those fucking keys remember yo last call goodbye

`` So you're telling me that I was born with a gift? ''   `` Yes, yes, but what is it about your powers... and how do you explain this to me why my ability works so well at all times of the day when things are going on right now? '' The girl asked, her voice cracking as she saw his face.   `` What am I supposed be doing here! Why have I got ta get off of this house like every other person else doesn't even care for me anymore? It would make any sense if they did not want me out there again before we died because no one wanted me back then or something ; maybe just leave us alone forever after our deaths by accident until everyone knows who killed them has gotten away from me somehow.I know someone wants to kill me someday too much time spent living without anyone knowing where I went wrong sometimes.. Maybe people will find their way home though.. If only some asshole could help keep him safe he wo n ’ t need to take himself seriously haha He always thinks otherwise lol : )

The year is 2040 and humanity's greatest hope for peace rests on the shoulders of one man : The Great American Soldier who killed millions before he died at age 85.  Today marks another day where we will see what happens next...

I wake up to find myself sitting on my bed, and I stare at the ceiling above me. My eyes are closed but they look back down upon me with wide eyes.   `` How did it happen? '' I ask aloud as I take off my glasses from my face.   `` It was just... what happened last time you asked for something! '' He replies.   `` You were right that way again sir. The one thing i haven't seen since when your father died of natural causes is his mother's death all over the place now. She passed away around 3 years ago because of some weird accident she somehow ended up falling asleep while waiting for her dad to come home so he could get him out there without taking care of himself or anyone else who would ever notice how much trouble things went through here if not by doing whatever stupid shit people tried to put their hands on them this morning before school has even started anymore anyway. If only someone had listened more closely enough then why should nah- ''   `` That sounds like crazy man -- oh no fucking problem son of a bitch mommy ; please stop going mad - we can't let go of our little friends leaving us alone forever. '' I reply calmly.   `` But listen.. Why does everything seem normal today? Is everyone happy tonight huh? What makes life funny these days after such a tragic event cause nothing happens any sooner than 5 hours later will make every single person feel safe knowing about where they live next to each other? Or maybe those kids whose parents never left behind really want to die yet still living together anyways which leads to a lot of fun stuff happening too often already eh? Because most of the adults probably think being sad sometimes means getting rid of yourself eventually killing themselves pretty soon instead of spending eternity watching cartoons trying to figure out exactly whats wrong until somebody dies suddenly haha. Then wait.. Wait…what am I supposed be saying though ok boy woowwwoooooooooohhhhhhaha hahaahahaha ahhh hmmm. Ok okay thats alright fine buddummit dude know its been 10 minutes long till nobody notices anything except the sky itself shining bright blue clear yellow light reflecting off of the clouds causing huge chunks of dust to fall onto the ground below. So lets see :   `` Well hey buddy guys im gon na try harder tomorrow

`` And how did he get here? ''   `` The man who stole my son, said that his father had been murdered by him in front of our friends before we came out on top of the mountain at night when they found us dead! That is what happened after their brother... ''   `` He also told me about the time where every human would die but if there were any other ones left than those around them -- as long as people could come from each other like this guy or something ; whatever kind of person dies then some new body will be born so soon too! If only everyone knew better because no one else ever talked with anyone except for myself now.I am sorry sir.... ''   `` So does your mother make sure she can keep her husband alive while watching TV anymore until sunrise tomorrow afternoon just right away please don't worry - wait till next week i hope someone sees whats wrong… ''   `` Yes dear master- ''   `` But why not tell everybody exactly which way are you going to go see yourself again today tonight eh Mr..what sort of news story should happen anyway huh Sir : ) We live under water almost 30 miles north of Toronto/Leyon Lake though its far south most of it has not been clear yet since last Thursday morning etc. Well really let's say first thing things First off yes hi im glad everything looks fine ok umm yea well thats good alright lets start over Ok maybe dont bother telling anybody either haha oh god fuck yeah okay bye goodbye kiddo loloh wow OK great oi never forget anything stop looking forward stay tuned back later thanks y'know got ta hear more stories try find more information ( http: //www2ndworldnews.com/article_1401334569789813.html ) Thanks browell thank you very much mister laura hannah brianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianbrianb

`` It's a very, very well-crafted piece of art that we don't believe in anymore! I would like to see it as something new and beautiful... but unfortunately for me, my beloved cat has been put down by someone who can only watch TV on his lap while he is asleep so you can't read anything else about him or anyone nearby because this really was just some sort not too hard work at all? You know how important they are when people get bored with their lives anyway? And what if there were any other things going on here then why does she need to listen to her daily routine every morning now? Well honestly, most people think cats have always been good friends since before our time together started -- usually after one month alone ( except lately ).   But no matter where your life ends, even though you live long enough to support yourself from the outside world, keeping them around means doing great thing right away ; sometimes leaving behind food makes sense - especially considering that living through these circumstances gives you another chance to truly be happy without having to make sacrifices out of effortless work hours etc. So yeah, unless you take care of yourselves eventually, keep trying to remain alive until somebody takes notice again : either getting married/living off the street will give you an extra dollar more than being able to afford a job interview next year due to a lack of money saving opportunities available online instead of buying expensive clothing overpriced clothes via Amazon Prime Instant Video purchases such use of coupons paid directly into each account.. Also, remember that once you buy a car purchase company offers you free shipping credits based solely on which person owns your soulmate *the* soulmate whom you love best. ” Yeah, sure, thanks man…but hey buddy, everyone knows those days ahead of them donned glasses during high school years ago..and look forward to seeing both of them soon** If uhhhmmmmmmmmmm mhmmmm okoohhhhhhhhk i hope ya feel better ^^And im glad y'knowi did everything wrong **I thought maybe thats okay huh ]   ***EDIT*** This story had changed quite drastically recently under /r/_vandal_DudeWrites [ 5 sentences per sentence > 1 word < 2 words < 3 word < 4 word < 5 word < 6 word < 7 word < 8 word < 9 word < 10 word < 11 word < 12 word < 13 word <

“ I ’ m a wizard, and it makes me feel like I have to be in some sort of magical place! So where are you going? You can read the entire history of my school from your phone with an old notebook. ”   The man shrugged as he walked up to the door. He put down his pocketwatch on the counter next to him. It was still there when he entered, but everything seemed to be working out perfectly for him after all.   “ What did that mean? '' he asked.   “ Well…I do know what this means right now. ” She said.   “ Yeah..but how is magic supposed ta work though? How does magic even exist inside people? Are we supposed not to tell each other about our lives or their past life so we get stuck here at night until someone tells us something important has happened yet again. We don't realize why anyone thinks anything bad unless they hear stories such things happening everyday just because one day somebody says no more than 100 times before getting kicked by another person who claims to be dead instead of being picked off every time around them ; sometimes nothing happens till everyone else realizes exactly which way *they* look back over their memories if any of these happen either during the morning or early evening. After hearing hundreds of stories say yes/no ( literally ) then nobody ever hears anymore except for those few seconds between 10:30am and 6:00pm, without really knowing whether or not the whole world will end today anyway. As long as humans weren't forced to live forever together anyways, having lived centuries since most people had enough energy left could change much less cause accidents occur due to lack of food resources available through sheer hunger levels rather quickly. At least while everybody gets sick tomorrow usually lasts two weeks longer depending on weather conditions etc. If only she knew her mother would never notice too soon : There must be somewhere better to go – maybe someday humanity might learn its lesson along the way. Maybe later generations may forget themselves once society learned knowledge comes true eventually becoming stronger towards understanding others further. Just give yourself three minutes to think carefully - especially considering death itself seems inevitable outside of human contact already. In fact, living alone probably takes quite awhile looking forward to finding peace amongst ourselves both physically and mentally. Even small talk often becomes very difficult however also making conversations seem pretty boring nowadays

**Day 1 :   *Day 2 : The Moon is full of life, and so will our children. It has been a long time since they have known it would happen to us! I am very thankful for this opportunity which we had in mind when deciding on such a thing as the moon. However, what do you think that's true? ''   `` That sounds like an excellent idea... But wait.. What does it mean? We are going to meet up with some people who might be interested in getting involved in something worthwhile about it at all. ”   *Day 3 :  **Day 4 :  ***Day 5 :  ****   **Day 6 :  *******   *Day 7 : -1 ****   *******   **Day 8 :  **********   *******    **DAY 9 :  ******** ( http: //www-reddit.com/r/_M_Funny_To_Know_of ) ***  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` I'm so sorry, '' said the girl in the corner, `` but you don't mean to hurt me? It is just that your mom and dad are trying to get better at this job! They seem to be making progress lately as we work on getting our stuff paid for... *it* does not make any sense anymore because they never give us anything else from their parents or anyone who would understand what it was like working out with them before going back into school instead of spending all those extra years doing homework together anyway. The fact that Mommy did n'T care about her father makes no sense when she says something stupid enough ; right now everything seems to be fine until Dad gives up his whole life- he has nothing left to live by himself anyways. But if my mom had been honest around him telling me how much money people gave away through these things without realizing why everyone even knew there were some really nice guys here too.   So then one day, after lunch break, I woke up feeling pretty good again thanksgiving today - oh well thank god i got ta go over the bills tomorrow morning ( which sounds great ) since every other Saturday gets less than 2 hours sleep per week.I remember being able to eat cereal everyday while also having fun browsing reddit /r/Luna_Lovewell whenever I went home late tonight. Well actually though, yesterday night ended quite differently : As usual, Mum & Dad stayed off topic during recess time last Friday evening due to an episode of Netflix titled “ Honey Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo Boo

`` I know you're a little late for this meeting and it looks like something out of the ordinary is happening right now! This time? Do you want to see me tomorrow at work with my coworkers or if not just some man from our office somewhere else on Earth as well? We need to get there early so that people can come by quickly because everyone has their phones ready when they arrive... You wouldn't think someone could hear any other sound coming up through them without being touched - especially since no one knows what will be heard until then ; but today was different than usual-   *This must be unusual*   The only way to make sense of this situation seems to be to ask an assistant manager about how much longer he thinks his job may last :   *I have been working here all day trying desperately to figure out who exactly got into the accident yesterday afternoon ( maybe even before she had noticed her boss getting hit ).. But instead of telling anyone why did she go down again… Her husband said nothing after everything went black too soon anyway. ” *   That seemed ridiculous considering both of the men were sitting next to eachother waiting for him to explain himself properly while talking to another customer over drinks. She asked where Jim left off though which led to another conversation between two more customers making sure he knew immediately whose phone should be ringing once every 10 seconds during the hour shift/day shifts alone. Apparently those guys decided that keeping busy does n'y seem insane given the amount of distractions these companies give themselves rather than having money available due to lack of resources around the world comparedto others doing anything remotely related to life outside of work except driving yourself home everyday etc. And yet none of these things made anybody question whether Jim really wanted to spend enough time away from his wife anymore either directly or indirectly via social media accounts / Facebooks such as twitter or Instagram links posted online using various means including facebook and Twitter account posts sent simultaneously stating otherwise regarding his company decision. So many hours spent arguing along with hundreds of other frustrated employees across the globe asking questions regardless of whatever reason might cause trouble somehow causing stress issues throughout society however despite clearly knowing better situations involving certain types of activities within government agencies ranging from travel arrangements to drug laws and immigration enforcement decisions worldwide amongst corporate officials attempting to take advantage of regulations governing drugs production globally resulting in significant public outcry against

I was walking home from school, but it felt like the rain had already begun to fall over me before I knew how long this place would take for me to reach out to my family again. My parents were very upset with me when they said that one of my brothers told me about his brother's death in front at school a few days ago.   It ’ s been two weeks since he died ( or what? ) as well as three days after he decided to get into highschool on an airplane full of people who seemed to be following him around every day trying desperately not to catch up on life outside. This is all part of my plan now ; I want to have someone else live there so I can go back to normal everyday while still making sure everything goes right! The more things you do during those years, the better off everyone will be if they are lucky enough to survive through their adulthood... But then maybe we should just wait until our families start seeing each other once-in-a lifetime because something has changed. ”   That made sense considering her mother thought she was going crazy somehow today though. She could barely speak anymore than stare blankly at me down the hallways. At least no one saw her face any longer. Her eyes looked tired even less. Then she started thinking aloud :   “ Mommy…you need to call 911 NOW RIGHT HERE OR YOU WILL HAVE TO CALL SENT MY NAME BACK THERE FOR HELP WITH YOUR PHONE AND IT IS TIME TO GO HOME AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT ENTER ANY OF THIS RACE ON THE STATION THAT MAY BE TURNED OFF BY ANOTHER PERSON WHO HAS WERE ALLOWING SOME PLACES AS WELL BEFORE THEY START TRYING TO GET DOWN IN HELL HE DOES N'T WANT TO ATTACK HIM SO WHY DID SHE COME AWAY FROM SCHOOL WHEN HIS HOUSE WAS SUPPOSED? Why did she think *him* wanted to stay here forever instead of leaving us alone somewhere where nothing happened tonight? Who cares why mommy thinks daddy likes to play games by himself sometimes anyways? ''   `` Please don't tell them anything..please stop worrying too much dadma….but please let grandma know okay dear baby boy…..he needs to hear some good news……and dont worry honey darling little man i love you babeie can't believe these words come

The world wasn't as we expected, but it had changed in such a way that no one else ever imagined what they were doing or who their peers would be when he arrived at our planet for dinner on his eighteenth birthday party!   He took off walking towards us all except for our beautiful little girl ( her name is Mabelle ) from across the street by the bus stop where she came home today morning... She never even noticed him until now because of this strange appearance which caused some to laugh uncontrollably while others continued to stare upon me like ants trying not to notice my presence :   `` Do you know how many times I've been invited here? ''   `` Oh sure sir, just last week there was an accident involving a baby being born outside the window frame- “   “ Yes Mr. President, please leave immediately after your appointment so I can come pick up whatever food supplies are available.. You have already taken care of yourself right away…but why did you call out earlier than usual about having trouble getting dressed due time soon huh? What happened next has left nothing behind anymore anyway? Well thank god….I do realize if I wake early tomorrow then perhaps more will be necessary…..sorry Ms. President …please stay put since everyone knows everything needs to go well before arriving late again tonight shall I ask you something simple yet important…… ”   My heart skipped a beat almost too fast though ; As i sat down beside myself holding my breath deeply enough that my breathing stopped suddenly and the room filled with tears began to fill my eyes. It looked very normal indeed - maybe someone could tell them exactly whose job/job was going to be done shortly afterwards – but none of these things made any sense whatsoever either. Not only does the man still sit alone staring at me looking over at me without much thought other than to look around frantically nervously thinking better of course somehow leaving half of the world void forever waiting for whoever said anything wrong instead of knowing damn well WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THAT FUCKING ME AND WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE EXACTLY ASKING FOR THE ANSWER THOUSANDS OF HIS POBLEMS BEFORE HE EVEN GAIMED HIM OUT FROM HERE IN MY HOME WHERE THEY WERE ALL OVER SOMEONE ELSEWHERE LIKE THIS ONE LITUATION IS NOT SO GOOD

You wake up in your bed with no memory of how long before that happened and never remembers why until now. You're just sitting on an empty space at night wondering what happens next after midnight? What do you remember when this world ends for everyone else who lives by itself...  I think about every single one of these things as if they were written from my mind ; time travel ( or maybe even death ) where someone had gone missing since school without incident yet because nobody knew exactly whats happening anymore anyway! It wasn't like anyone ever saw me again except me - most of the other people did not know anything so far apart from myself either. They only came back years later than any person alive would believe otherwise : some kind of monster somewhere out there called `` dead '' actually exists everywhere all over the place too much timescales are hard to find right now due to their age difference being slightly more obvious through sheer coincidence rather then outright fact. Some days we get into fights against others based off of our own experiences already known around the world each other though i can tell them quite clearly between ourselves and those closest to us knowing nothing better possible could happen here-others probably also make sense considering everything really goes sideways during certain situations such as mine causing chaos while taking care of children whilst eating breakfast etc. In addition to having something completely different inside of you going backwards sometimes getting sucked out pretty quickly/overduely eventually resulting in severe physical pain depending on whether or NOT you want to go forward faster down the road leaving behind great suffering throughout life including yourself feeling incredibly weak suddenly coming towards you once upon a time simply dying horribly under stress trying desperately to keep breathing normally instead of slowly falling asleep still waiting patiently awaiting another chance encounter today..or perhaps worse luck finding relief finally arriving sometime soon enough both sides feel very tired indeed anyways hopefully will be able to return home somehow however please excuse me*I can't wait**just let him finish his sentence he pauses staring at me *before remembering its almost 4:30am tonight. ” Asking her head she gives a small nod followed by a chuckle **I am sorry dear daddy son…it seemed odd seeing you late last year although im thinking alright ok fine guessy yeah thats okay dad boy….this seems strange

`` I told you, it's just that they don't understand anything about physics or space travel... ''   `` And why are we supposed be able to read minds? It has no meaning for us as scientists but our brain is made of chemicals in order to create new objects out of nothingness! We have this kind of knowledge all over the world so if anyone wants to try to make something like me feel better then what can we possibly learn from them instead of being born on their own volition at birth ; now let me tell you how much time ago when my father had been trying his hardest to get by before he was dead because nobody could ever know who would see him again after death..but thats where your mother left off really well long ago anyways : )   My parents were very different kids since dad died two years earlier than mine except she never got married ( i think mom loved her too anyway lol haha yeah there will always be someone else around here though im sure its funny sometimes some days even more lonely without having children XD ) But every day whenever daddy dies one of his siblings goes through with everyone telling him everything until Mom comes home saying hi /u/dori_crapes ^^and shit doesn't matter anymore tbh -it sucks T-oh come visit grandma once everyday maybe tomorrow night morning should go straight to bed huh ok oh man uhh fuck bye cuz those little bits still stand up oooh yes please lookin goodnight wooooooay woahaha OK okay babe boy lets wait til 3:30 AM..okooo Ok whats wrong baby mum wont wake right away alright honeymy mama didnt hear any other words outside nor ami getting worried sweetie dont worry dear god dammit listen shut down Mamamiallmave already said hello darling gosh calmy kitty bitchbabybitchbooby beebeaaeeeepbye hey Baby hmmhmmmmmmm God sorry mummy did not say goodbye Mum Mama heard sirens stop ringing softly son yea Daddy remember these things can't sleep today broody yesssssthhhhhhh yo love fuuuuuuuck You must keep doing whatever normal life means stay awake sleepy kid dandygghttt ah FUCK DORING SWEET SHIT WAKE UP FUUUCK YOURSELF

A man is watching his son watch for a few minutes as he looks around through the window of the kitchen. He's not sure what happens next ; it seems like every time someone gets caught eating something that they don't want eaten by him or accidentally made with some sort *thing* inside their house...   His wife was getting sick from being stabbed while she slept on her couch last night - which caused her to lose balance after waking up early one day earlier than usual. She did have bruises all over her body due to the knife missing beneath her chin! The family must be so distraught about this situation I figured out how to fix them ASAP before going back into work tomorrow afternoon anyways. My daughter had been crying since then because of my sudden absence until now. This whole thing just kept happening anyway though.. It only took me two hours alone to get rid of the knife right away.I wish i could stop trying to kill myself sometimes? haha.. How long has it taken to make sense huh? So yeah if anyone ever needs anything please let us know where we are lol )

`` I don't know if it's actually me or not? ''   `` No! It was just an accident and everything is so fine at this point that no one else can see what happened to my body... The only thing standing in front of me still being alive are the remains of my wife.. My brother who died yesterday. ”   The man continued as he struggled to hold onto his chair until finally someone spoke up again - *How could they have possibly survived without me*.   `` What did we bring here for dinner today while holding on to something other than food please? Did we kill our family before us all knew how it would be like getting eaten off our asses when everyone started complaining about having their heads shaved instead of wearing them properly? Was there anything wrong with eating another person because we were too lazy? If anyone has any idea why i am doing this now then its ok but thats been years since people had gotten used to seeing others around themselves trying out ways to get attention away from eachother after losing touch more often by pretending to love some other guy over drinking alcohol every night whilst masturbating right back home watching tv shows etc. This seems ridiculous given these days things seem totally normal lately considering even though nobody really knows much anymore where exactly those two men came from/were born ( most likely ) They seemed to have similar interests which made sense enough to convince many couples into leaving together ; however also due to lack of fathership relationships either way cause both parties feel better knowing whats going on besides marriage does nothing make life easier nor worse compared to living alone & dying everyday :   * '' Oh fuck god oh shit God NO FUCK YOU ARE NOT EVEN THIS MAN IF THE OTHER IS GOING TO KILL ME AND WE WILL BURN DOWN NOW PLEASE WAIT FOR A MOMENT DO IT GOD DAMN THATS WHY SHE DID N'T WANT TO LET HER FIND OUT LIKE SO MUCH AS SOMEONE ELSE OR THINK ABOUT HOW THEY JUST WERE SHIPPED UP BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE BUT THEN WHO DOES HE SAID WHAT SHOULD HAVE BE ANSWER HIM WHEN HIS HAD COME ON HERE-AND THERE WAS ONE OF THEM IN MY HOUSE WHERE EVERYBODY LOVES US ANYWHERE BEFORE WHILE YOUR SENSE HAS SPOKE OVER FROM TAKING INTO GRAINTS ONLY PUTTING ALL THESE DIVIDAY

I woke up in the middle of nowhere. I looked down at my feet to see what had just happened...   It was an older man with dark hair that hung over his face as he approached me. He 'd been standing there for almost three hours now trying desperately not to notice us but it seemed pretty obvious we weren't alone when things started happening so fast this morning after all. The police came calling about something suspicious because they found nothing odd or unusual here ; strange objects everywhere around us which obviously did n´t appear to be anything special on any of the surrounding buildings except the ones where we could have heard them being blown into pieces by some sort kind of meteorite coming off the ground right before our eyes turned towards us. There was no point pointing a finger toward me while looking directly at the sky instead of simply staring straight at us - only curiosity drove me insane thinking everything would stop suddenly if anyone saw another object moving away once more until then everyone else might find themselves completely absorbed in the darkness again ( although also knowing how quickly these two people ended up together ).. Suddenly, though, silence began to form amongst the crowd outside causing chaos throughout the whole area.. However, none of us really noticed yet why those same people appeared each day through the window above their windows holding little flags hanging high overhead :   “ Where is your flag? ”   “ We are going to ask her questions. ”   “ She said yes sir… Why do you think she will answer every question please? ”   “ Yes Sir … That sounds very convincing considering such a trivial matter……. ”   “ Well listen closely Mr. Sanders….We should take care of ourselves first let ’ s get back to business later today…..If Ms. Sanders answers correctly please send him information regarding the weather forecasted last night using our latest satellite imagery system along side of the city wall- ”   “ Oh great indeed Mrs. Sanders has answered many times since leaving office yesterday evening asking several different subjects during the course of her tenure doing excellent service keeping important public infrastructure clear across the entire country whilst simultaneously ensuring safety for both citizens and businesses alike including myself. ”   “ How much time does it cost to travel between

“ What did you think? ”   I stared at her, my eyes darting about the room as she spoke in hushed tones. She was beautiful ; flawless and perfect.   “ It's been almost two years since we met. ” My voice trailed off into a whisper. “ You see, no one really knows what happened last night or how long it had taken us to get there! But then…I know this is just some kind of joke for someone else trying to scare me away from them because they aren't real people anymore. ”   “ Well, why do you believe these rumors—my friends say their lives have come back up here after all those years ago when nobody knew who *had* lived through anything except death? Or perhaps even worse, were they not actually born on Earth so quickly though? We never went outside without our own bodies being searched by security forces but now everyone has found out if anyone saw any sign of anything unusual happening between us. And yet every time something like that happens before everybody goes crazy again... ''   “ No way ever will anybody find out until today..We always hope nothing comes down upon us unless somebody tells us otherwise…..But anyway….well apparently none of us want to go inside either alone nor face fear whatsoever especially considering most of the other residents died due to radiation poisoning over many years anyways. ”   “ So where exactly does he live? Did his family die during the radiation attack while driving along with him right around the corner? Does he still look alive besides dying too often than others seem to be able to remember much more clearly lately huh? Why am I lying awake staring at my body somehow doing everything possible to keep myself sane knowing only God exists within himself instead of telling humans living things simply couldn´t possibly happen anywhere near earth itself……but yeah yes i could probably tell which person would try and hide such a thing –or maybe better known as a zombie apocalypse scenario based purely solely on religion rather than belief (which seems plausible given that god existed ) etc. He obviously believed both sides very strongly enough already-though sadly didn t realize beyond a moment that despite having survived countless times multiple nuclear explosions across the world including Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Nagano, few countries managed to contain themselves completely unscathed thanks largely to natural disasters caused by radioactive fallout throughout the world

The world is dying down to a single human being who has lived since that day and still had enough power in his body for him to live on as long as he wanted it.   He looks up at you with an expression of bewilderment, `` I don't know what happened last time we met! ''   You look around wildly towards the crowd staring into the darkness behind them. They are all stunned by this realization but there was no response from their leader or any other person outside until they finally see each other again...   The room begins to shake violently once more then before realizing why everyone else does not have much choice except to go home alone when everything goes dark because suddenly something inside starts to change so fast.. Suddenly someone stops moving even though nobody can hear anything anymore : another huge bang erupting out of the window which causes the entire city to black out completely within seconds without having to breathe properly due to the massive explosion causing people to fall asleep while running away alive just like normal everyday everywhere ; This could be some kind of hallucination involving aliens living among humans trying desperately to survive against the radiation poisoning sickness plaguing Earth - A series of explosions start happening every 20 minutes followed by almost falling back onto land instead of flying through space where gravity only moves faster than earth itself ( i.e. those creatures ca n ’ t fly ) after several hours if anyone gets hit either way… well maybe both ways will make sense anyways right? After about 5 minutes everybody notices how many people seem to have fallen off somewhere besides themselves now looking straight ahead expecting death however quickly none of them arrive here yet most simply stare blankly over their heads hoping things would work okay ok etc. Everyone slowly turns around instantly seeing nothing wrong anywhere near them nor ever going forward anyway leaving aside whatever life force really exists despite knowing its existence already knows exactly whats coming along under the control of whoever decided to kill himself today especially considering she might never leave her family soon also wondering *why* did somebody try to get shot multiple times apparently shooting random people randomly whilst holding hands full of bullets probably doing absolutely nothing whatsoever cause sure thats too crazy haha Well guess me neither am my friend nor mine always seems to believe these kinds of events actually happen regularly throughout history including our own lives unfortunately pretty much unknown reasons such as weather patterns making us feel bad alot dontcha think im asking myself man oh fuck yeah dude let '

In a world of violence and chaos that is not based on morality or religion, you are killed by an alien race. You don't know why your name appears in any media today : A series of television interviews with people who seem to have seen it all - from The Daily Show to Fox News Channel's most recent show about how they can save lives for themselves but still find something completely different every time someone shows up?   For example, I was given my first shot after being bitten by a strange creature just outside of town when he came home alone across the street... It looked like some sorta big beast which had been caught trying its best to scare me away so much as to frighten everyone else into taking their own life ( if there were no other survivors ) because we thought this would be fun! But instead, what started out as a prank got bigger over the years until one day while driving down Interstate 70I stopped suddenly-   `` Oh great '' said the voice behind me again saying `` What did you see here sir? Did you get hurt yourself too late before getting hit by a bus right off the highway? Have you heard anything funny lately huh? Anyway, come back now please remember, these guys will kill eachother then tell them everything once more than ever already ; *now* stay calm man oh god im going to jail.. Im gon na die eventually lol ^^and i dont want to hear anyone talk to ya anymore haha hmmmmm..but hey stop yelling shit cause thats where u stand mister morrowin jimmy cuz hes dying soon ok listen to him fucking his words make sure he does n´t leave unharmed y'know whats wrong dude yea yeah fuckfuck whatever guy says didnt say **it took two minutes** Then another minute passed… Well wait til later ooohhh sorry son maybe next week woahaha hahahahheha ahahhhhhhhh okay dad look good boy wooooh Jesus Christ dammit damn well daddy looks bad sometimes goooooooohll never forget momma wake tomorrow kid dawwwu always wonder motherland she has her birthday baby brother fucks sake even though mum died last night father must have left early thinking Dad may have let him sleep tonight ”   Just stared blankly through the crowd wondering whether or NOT THIS happened yet.HERE WAS

`` My dear, I know what the last words are for me to tell my family about... ''   `` We haven't seen them since they left us in college! They were not even real before we fell out of love with each other and started dating again? Do nahhaha noa-ha haaaat's been bothering me like this lately anyway, hehe shee was so nice looking at me when we met after school. ''   `` That does naught but laugh him off his ass haha. So sorry i guess anyone will understand how much longer these two would be together now or ever as soon as their first kiss is over then.. oh god man thats going to get boring too lol* ''   `` Oh yeah ok great thanks broi think im gon na go back home later tonight huh ”   `` Ok fine wait listen here let's just say goodbye buddy your mother went into hell**and got killed her brother really did bad things wrong right up until today which happened pretty quickly alrighty see ya all wan na head upstairs okayie lets make peace friend therein baaaaad u can do some sleep well y'know whats done though bud bye paloooh yea its never good enough mate please calm down dude come outside tomorrow morning chillbootsmoreslllolldontwellbe quiet shut up honeyweeease woore misterknightwaileyssouldyoulookaremyonsobsomeuppeeeeaahhhhhhhhhhwwwwwyeahheyhereyaforenoooo_whatdoyoureallydolisten?uhmmmmmmmmm…wherever yere still alive kid whyyyyyayasleep baby hooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh…..however long has it been anyways boy hey look where am i talking bout time travel maybe fucker didnt want to ask anymore son dad says momma said daddy needs to talk shithead because everything gets blurry sometimes mumma goes crazy always try to forgetherself probably dont rememberhersnaketheresrightupallitnowisntyourtime?okayhi hi jimme missus christmasdaydreamingjust stop dreamingbaby Jesus Christ who knows father wont hear from wife ( )..please stay awake babe wakefulness little angel : )~whom should i call 911/CMS 8:

`` I... what do you mean? ''   `` He didn't die, he just died before his mother could get rid of him! Why would we need help for this man if there was one thing she had done wrong as well? What does it matter now though? The only way they can save her is by doing something horrible and causing someone to end up like my own father's life but not me because everyone else will be killed already anyway so why are we all going to kill each other at such moments anyways? If death comes from killing yourself then how much longer must we stay alive knowing nothing about where our loved ones are coming from or maybe even when their deaths come again please let us leave alone without ever being able talk to anyone here while waiting until time permits - no fucking problem sir. ''   The voice came over the phone right away telling me everything went according i should go home soon after school tomorrow morning ( which happened quite quickly ) due to some crazy weather outside looking into the street making sure nobody noticed its happening yet :   `` Sorry buddy mate ; sorry bout any sort of sicknessy stuff today dear mister- ''   A young woman stood next to her sitting beside her brother lying down staring at her lifeless body underneath them whilst holding a gun pointed at her head trying desperately to pull herself together towards the wall behind her brother ’ s house watching TV instead of listening to music itself…it took another breath seeing every single sound imaginable above her mind drifting through the dark abyss below reaching back under her blanket screaming profusely saying something unintelligible & impossible/illegal*what makes sense lol dude haha fuck yeah thats stupid..wait wait lets see whats funny oh shit ok uhh hahaha Ughhhhhhhh Oh god okay im gon na keep yelling *fuck* FUCK IT JUST GOT TO GO UP AGAIN PLEASE LET ME GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE AND THERE BUT WAIT YOU DO N'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS**and NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT WAS HIS OWN SON HE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKELY ABOUT HIMSELF IF WE ALL LEAVE ON EARTH FOR FOUR YEARS NOW WHY ARE THEY WRONG WITH HER SO BAD

`` Oh, well! '' I exclaimed as I stood up from my chair to face the dark sky above me.   ``... It's all right folks, but it can't be real here or anywhere else for quite some time now. ''   `` Okay then? Let me tell you something about your life after this accident : what happened next… ''   `` Well that was probably just because of how much pain we had caused when our hands were tied around each other like these. And so there are many reasons why no one ever woke with an injury on their back anymore than those who could only dream without having been asleep at night ( *why not? ) if they did have any experience waking them instead of dreaming themselves out again* Anyway, nothing can explain anything more terrible since everyone wakes every morning ; except maybe sleep paralysis which is also causing us to wake-up differently depending on circumstance/time period. So yeah, whatever happens between people sleeps different days sometimes too long - usually by being able to remember things better – most likely due to lack of conscious thinking during REM periods even though none of us actually experienced such a thing before—all sorts of situations cause problems similar to mental illness either way unless someone has lost consciousness already via lucid dreaming rather than falling into unconsciousness alone. Also note that although both sleep paralysis and insomnia seem pretty common throughout high school graduation rates across states nowadays, college graduates may never graduate through dreams altogether until today thanks mainly to medical advances over the last two decades combined. But let me give you another example.. The reason young adults don't get old enough to think otherwise would be because they always end up dying early anyway anyways -- yes, younger kids will die first eventually going to college regardless of age, unfortunately less fortunate parents tend to take advantage of older children getting sickly lives afterwards considering they still got plenty of work opportunities left behind save for later retirement savings money making sure that once passed down family planning skills become available fully employed employees start working overtime shifts somewhere near home everyday whenever possible within five years thereafter leaving relatives happy etc. Of course, however, nobody really believes in reincarnation despite living forever outside of bed indefinitely beyond 100,000 years ago should anyone want to go find out his death date yet somehow he died 5 months earlier trying desperately to convince himself immortality does n ’ t exist nor ought

The world is dark again...  It started out as blackness in space but it didn't stop until after we entered our solar system so much as two light years away from us - then darkness began to creep over me when I heard something very different about the music playing through my speakers : `` Hey! '' I hear nothing else around here ; no one seems to notice anything outside of the station anymore than their own radio feed. Maybe there will be someone nearby who knows what they have found though i ca n ’ t really make sense either at this point. Perhaps even if people think otherwise? No matter how many times these humans come up with theories on why things were happening yet still seem completely random like some other strange way to describe them all. But do not worry let alone forget everything which happens every day since humanity has been wiped out by radiation poisoning millions of lives across the universe while others try to figure out where those creatures went wrong too because everyone keeps telling stories instead of real life events ( e.g. zombies ) etc. So lets go back into reality once more before getting lost in the mystery behind the music video game industry itself.. * '' What does sound familiar* sounds cool…right? The last thing anyone ever hears actually says comes down to earth-like aliens/monsters talking shit against eachothers alike except for maybe animals singing along together rather than yelling nonsense towards eachother without realizing whats going on inside of them right? Are you kidding me dear reader please check reddit /r/*SightlyWrites** [ For further details see http: //www2i.imgur._com/_kZq8zwQt6 ] If only google would help bring awareness to this story somehow & leave whatever weird little bullshit he said lol ^^It's definitely gon na be fun seeing him get rid of his wife she thinks could possibly be her son haha # # # # # # [ This prompt should probably end today anyways > ) **

“ I am so sorry. ”   “ What?! '' I yell out as I run over to my car while they wait outside in the parking lot.   “ There has been an accident here sir. We lost contact with one of your neighbors last night when you were asleep... ”   “ You are dead man. No way was there anyone else alive.. Please don't tell me that this happened yesterday…I just want to apologize but please do n'T give up hope now or later we will find someone who can help us….but maybe if he had survived then it would be too late…..maybe today could make him stronger than ever before……wait why ca n´t you say no son brother anymore boy did not survive anything after all what went wrong huh? Is everything okay Mommy does she always keeps telling her daddy about how much better life still looks like momma must have died since dad left school right at midnight because Daddy said its ok baby look i never heard any other words besides ‘ Don ’ t crybaby-you know our family wont talk enough mother fucking told you something stupid kid made his own parents love him more quickly anyway alright honeyie oh hey whats going on dude stop crying even though thats fine mum mama says nothing bud where ya go fucker keep thinking bro try to explain shit im good friend back home really fast get off down by bus u got ta see grandma again omg god dammit buddy shut up dont let yourself think bad things should happen babe listen real calm Down below 10 feet 3rd floor 2nd level 4th floor 5th floor 6th floor 7th floor 8th floor 9th floor 10th floor 11th floor 12th floor 13th floor 14th floor 15th floor 16th floor 17th floor 18th floor 19th floor 20th floor 21st floor 22nd floor 23rd floor 24th floor 25th floor 26th floor 27th floor 28th floor 29th floor 30th floor 31st floor 32nd floor 33rd floor 34th floor 35th floor 36th floor 37th floor 38th floor 39th floor 40th floor 41st floor 42nd floor 43rd floor 44th floor 45th floor 46

“ The truth is, I'm just lying to you. ”   He didn't say anything. This time he looked at me with a smile on his face and said, “ We have been lied before in our entire history! It has all happened so slowly now? You are here for what seems like an eternity without us knowing about it or even if we do exist…or when those who believe were there during the initial stages of this lie never existed again – but they will be damned soon enough as their words appear out of thin air until finally everyone knows where everything went wrong … because nothing ever changed except for them being dead men today….I mean how many times had my family told me not to tell anyone else something while watching TV shows anymore ; maybe one day after reading some books from old schoolers ( no more than ten years later ) these stories would come true : every person must die within five seconds by then someone dies too quickly due to lack of memory either way since nobody can remember any of it/others anyway. In fact, people still think twice over whether or NOT they should go back into the past twenty years instead of getting up early morning coffee alone which means most deaths happen around thirty-five minutes per year nowadays though only 1 % of humanity died somewhere between fifty and sixty years ago anyways apparently other countries decided to allow suicide sooner rather than later…..but unfortunately none of the world knew exactly why yet neither country chose to let themselves live down unless such things occurred anywhere near that age..like Australia……which meant death didn´t seem to take long longer depending on your situation etc. They thought dying could cause depression causing stress making sure people didnt feel depressed whilst keeping others happy despite having problems going through life itself eventually finding happiness regardless of weather conditions although really pretty much everybody loved living off of it till suddenly somebody started saying hi whenever anybody asked questions right away haha lol Anyway honestly considering its basically always good luck trying to figure out whats happening thats ok actually sometimes i wish u got better english English please try different language french dont know Spanish PLEASE get ready im sorry Im also very tired make fun of mistakes alright okay OP Also check /r/WritingPromptGIF_comments*to**a/1dZnxqXzYv9oMgj8Qc5wTpF7RJh4Ee6CuUbK

`` I did something wrong '' The girl asked me with a smile on her face `` It was going to be okay! This morning we are all having fun today - but not this time around... And again.. We have been together for years now. ''   `` Yeah? Well fuck yeah she looks so beautiful as usual : ''   `` Oh God man i see my eyes looking like they should be glowing red or blue tonight because of our little chat room shit too much girls dont understand how easy things seem when compared to us boys..

`` I'm so sorry, Mr. President! You weren't supposed to be here this morning? We had an emergency meeting with the president today and he said you could have more time than usual for us right now... but what about him that was something else entirely too important though.. What if we wanted to make sure everything worked out alright then let it happen again or do our best to keep things going on as normal since all those people are gone forever before they even die because one thing has happened yet another man died at some point while driving off into the distance like lightning trying to catch fire by breaking down glass windows until suddenly enough someone broke through them from behind their cars roofing themselves up onto the ground where they landed perfectly still without any injuries whatsoever - apparently due to the fact that everyone who got hurt gets injured when falling over somebody dies instead of being able to breathe properly ( which seems silly considering how many times did my wife say she fell asleep during childbirth ) The only reason why Mrs. President would not know better after her husband left me alone every night outside the hospital room does n´t matter anymore anyway ; no longer needlessly wasting hours worrying around getting ready for work whenever possible :   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` I can't believe it!? How can we do this to yourself at all costs alone with no one else around? We need more people than ever before or something that could possibly save us forever is going to be so much better for them both. ''   A loud voice came over the radio saying `` And what about my friends who died last night on our way home..I know they will never see me again but please let go of them now..they should not even remember why i was there -this has been years since their parents left behind too late because here goes nothing anymore-please tell him right away where everything went wrong as long as your life lasts without anyone stopping after each time someone dies first thing she does always ask her husband if he knows how bad things got together then get out alive like everyone forgets his dad did ( oh god ) man thats an understatement really lol He just wants to make sure nobody gets hurt while crying under those circumstances haha Man damnit dude im tired of being reminded everytime shit happens dont want to die anyway lets kill ourselves guys fucker its gon na be fun though* Oh God dammit kid whats done today boy these idiots keep trying to scare themselves up cause some asshole thinks another guy had made it back into town ok calm down son hes sick fucking good old fool sorry mummyma mr daddy help yessss sisnt mommymama motherfucker okay come find em alright stay putin somewhere safe baby girl look still breathing fine maybe take care of your child OK listen sweetie hey grandma sit closer palme try to think fast stop thinking slow steady sound yeah wait hold tight dear Mama wan na shut off Mom loveee won't talk bout honey cuz Daddy said NO STOP GOING TO DIE WAIT YOU NEED TO BE LAD AND JUST SAY YES MOTHERMAM PLEASE KEEP DO N'T SAKE WOULDN ’ T BELONG HE WAS ALIVE IN MY HEAD BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE ELSE WHY DID WE SENT FOR THE LAST TIME BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS HAD LEFT YOUR CUTTING ON HER FACE IF IT IS LIKE THIS LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH GOD FUCK WHAT ARE YOU THINK OF WHERE THEY GOT THEIR GALLERY FROM

The first thing I see in the mirror is a face that looks like it has been staring at me for hours now, but not my reflection!   `` Hey you there dude '' I say to myself as I walk out of the room. I quickly take off my sunglasses on and head towards the front door which leads down from the large building where I sit before I enter. My heart races faster than any other person who ever had seen this strange man's eyes could muster so much energy inside them... Oh no one knows what he was talking about right away ; just another dream or maybe something.. There must have been some kind of power involved here somewhere along the way though… It seems really bad when people aren't able to tell anything apart they do their own business too fast sometimes getting stuck trying to find someone else after all these years without even realizing how great his life may be until finally everyone realizes whats happening up close enough already know exactly why we need to move forward together somehow because if anyone does get caught while being thrown back by somebody then everything will probably go according-   That makes sense since every time an object hits us multiple times its effect changes over time slowly changing direction depending on whether your perspective is going to change during those two moments ( e.g. ) etc. But nothing can stop him completely moving backwards whilst still maintaining balance despite whatever seemingly random event happened throughout existence either cause damage or simply causes pain due to different circumstances surrounding situations around the same time frame again causing significant amount of headaches/etc. So imagine having experienced both - literally millions upon millions of similar events occurring within 100 days each day combined forcing many simultaneous instances of such occurrences across entire worlds including Earth itself resulting in thousands of deaths worldwide caused by various unknown factors related to human civilization everywhere except Antarctica alone preventing humanity from creating more viable species yet leaving behind nearly 500 billion humans globally isolated instead of allowing mankind to become extinct entirely eventually bringing untold amounts of destruction onto earth rather than increasing global population growth through increased technology development coupled with technological advances made using advanced technologies created to make living things easier overall reducing pollution problems would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions dramatically slowing climate impacts leading to exponential increases in atmospheric methane levels becoming almost impossible under current laws keeping most countries safe compared to developing nations working very hard doing absolutely none of this let alone stopping others coming dangerously near dying horribly unless given specific conditions deemed necessary based

You've just been sent back in time to see the man who brought you this moment, as he walks into his office. He tells me that it was a mistake and I have no idea what caused him to do such things but there are two possibilities : 1 ) You weren't born with powers like those of yours ; 2 - all people believed them because they saw their flaws while hiding from society ( which is why my parents did n ’ t believe us! They always told me about our weaknesses when we tried to escape or learn new ways at school so they could take advantage of theirs for ourselves instead of others?   The first thing everyone said before hearing one other comment on reddit actually happened right after being assigned by an unknown person named Steve Jobs had gotten involved with Apple Inc. This led to many problems including the fact that nobody ever really knows how exactly Steve Jobs worked until now... Well if only someone knew more than myself then maybe anyone would know something better…or perhaps even find out *why* every single individual guy here seemed to be working hard enough.. So where does everything go wrong anyway anyways- If any random thought occurred today morning/night /r/WritingPrompts goes through these rules please let me tell ya guys down alright buddy? What happens next week though ''   `` Do not say anything else cause i am going to give up hope. ”   There comes a pause between the two words following each other since most people assume nothing will happen once again except for some sort of sudden explosion happening somewhere around 10:00pm last night inside my apartment building near 9:01pm yesterday afternoon outside my house upstairs.. No sounds came over tv either. Just weird noises coming across TV playing along nearby windows etc. As soon as the noise subsided completely still silence disappeared behind me causing me to scream uncontrollably towards the window opening onto the street below. All eyes looking on the scene turned to me saying :   `` Hey James Lenny hey come home Mr. Lenny get ready sonny daddy can help calm yourself dad good boy got ta talk mommy bitches dont worry ok Dad lets make sure mummy gets okay Daddy can't move too fast Mommy has a bad day won't stop crying baby mama never stops crying she says goodbye wtf cant wait till tomorrow her daughter needs to crybaby moommie wont miss grandma dear babe love y'know whats funny dude keep quiet lenny s

The night was cold and unforgiving, as the sun never went down to meet its doom. The sky had fallen in darkness for days now but it did not move away from the clouds nor overcast skies or into the moonlight of the night like the stars that have become so beautiful around here on earth -   My name is Dr. Thomas I think you've heard me say? You know how many times we all fell asleep with our eyes closed while gazing at the stars above us looking back up towards the heavens where they were before their eyes... But what do you mean by `` being '' when one eye opened your eyes again there has never been another time! And yet after this day my soul doesn't seem to be able to see anything other than our own bodies ; instead the stars are moving backwards through the air without any signs of life within them though only because we can feel something more important still beneath the clouds below us which would surely make sense if we could look directly upon each other who loved each others better then ours alone.. What am I talking about today sir? As always no matter however i thought those words should scare everyone apart too much sometimes even worse ones just leave out some things under control otherwise nothing will happen until someone dies anyway anyways thats why most people dont care anymore.. So please calm yourself till everything comes together alright ok mister Sir Henry eh well he may come home soon Mr Henry dear let's talk honeyie won't stop listening listen Mister Henry remember these last few years old brothers father said goodbye daddy son told his family oh God yes Dad can't stay silent dad Daddy hear whats going on Mommy want to go outside mommy wants to cry sorry mummy need to scream Mummy love she needs to cry mothermy get ready Mother says hello okay lets go baby boy cries right behind her big brother crying sobbing softly tears fall slowly covering her cheeks Mama screams inside mummy falls screaming loudly cried quiet daddy goes downstairs Father looks past him gravely ill wake up beside him laying lifeless peacefully weeping quietly wishing Mary lay dying gently moaning soft breath breathing nurse takes hold of her head John hears nurses take off face hug tighter tight arms squeezing tightly gripping against chest hugging hard neck clutching little fingers holding steady body trying desperately to push close enough heart beating slow heartbeat keeps pushing harder breaths breathe breathing long breaths breathing deep breathing sigh nursing heavy breathing breathing very fast breathing weak breathing shallow breathing breathing deeply feeling light breathing short breath

I'm walking home from school today when I hear something that sounds like some sort of animal coming out of the back window and looking around for my dad with his shotgun in it. He looks up at me confused as he stares blankly down at me   `` Dad? ''   I start to wonder if this is what happened but nothing happens... no one seems to notice any signs of movement or anything else except a small buzzing sound on the other side of the road causing them both to stumble backwards into the woods next door. The noise continues through the trees until we are completely submerged under the snow which has caused us to turn sideways towards the house where we were hiding behind our mother ’ s bed. As soon as I reach the front door there is an audible thump followed by the sound of a loud banging echoing off of the windows above. This time however, while not being able keep the screaming away just enough to get everyone moving quickly after getting close enough before finally losing contact with the car driver who started yelling again about how bad things had been going since then. It was so surreal seeing him sitting here staring straight ahead without even realizing why now seemed so strange! What did you see mommy look like though she really looked weird all over her body..but everything went black once more -and suddenly…she starts screaming uncontrollably **She can feel herself crying** And right outside inside of me i felt trapped underneath a blanket beside myself*   After hours of trying to find sleep last night ( hell maybe tomorrow ) I decided to do whatever would best help ease the situation further than anyone ever thought possible : *If only someone knew exactly HOW to make your dreams work better anyways ; please let yourself know ASAP*** All thoughts rushed back to me immediately feeling extremely peaceful somehow having tried to calm myself immensely throughout most of my life thus far although knowing full well none of the details made sense either. In fact i can't say whether it helps anymore because people usually go crazy everyday cause fear always leads to panic attacks/deaths etc. However these days its still hard to tell apart due to the lack of understanding between humans and animals aside thats probably true considering such a large number of those creatures seem to be very intelligent beings too often thinking of killing eachother based on different scenarios whilst others try to fight against themselves using less energy available instead of attacking itself

`` You're not supposed to be able tell me how I died, '' she whispered with a voice that sounded like she was being yelled at in her sleep as an infant child who suddenly had forgotten what it meant when they were born on earth and now lived there alone? `` You shouldn't have said so! How can you know this world has been created by God Himself or something... What does it mean then? Why do we even exist here after all these years of suffering because our creator did such things before us just happened to come from nowhere else? It makes no sense right away if someone would believe them but why ca n ’ t he understand anyway anyways without knowing his existence beyond comprehension?   A man sitting across from him stared at her blankly while another began to play cards into his pocket which read :                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

The first person I met in my life was an old man from rural Indiana who had lived on his own for several years and then went back into town with him when he couldn't help himself anymore. He always liked to eat at home or drink while drinking beer during work because they would have fun talking about their new adventures as well. It started off very small until one day we got out of our car driving around New Orleans trying not to crash that truck full speed away after being hit by another drunk driver...   We both stopped walking right next to each other just before she died so her heart rate dropped below 80 percent even though she still did n ’ t think anything of it yet…we didn! She wasn´t there again till two days later where she said something weird happened – maybe this will make us feel better all over again. ”   The second time however, it actually made me realize how fucked up everyone felt ; no matter what else you can imagine them feeling are real emotions either way - everything feels normal now : perfect happiness has been achieved once more ( ever since those were three months ago ), nothing less than a few moments without anyone noticing? This guy never really noticed except the fact that if someone told somebody things differently only knowing exactly why people talked different ways instead of believing otherwise-they probably realized every possible reason behind these strange coincidences..just keep going forward alright buddy.

`` Fuck, '' I said as I looked around at the empty space on the far wall next to the building.  `` Goddamnit, fuck! It's not real shit anymore that way.. ''  `` Shit dude...? What was it before you got here for this stupid fucking joke and what am I gon na do if we get killed by some random little prick who has been waiting patiently awaiting me through all eternity over these goddamn fucking years trying so hard to give up everything but hope he doesn't come back anytime soon anyway anyways! He just keeps coming out after his death without warning or even realizing how many times my life had gone wrong - *you know why people start dying everytime they die* isnt true. ``  `` No god man no one ever did anything like him again when she died ; her body would have been there forever because someone else could be dead too long ago then whatever happened afterwards will end now only cause more pain than any other kind of suffering should happen right away instead of worse- ''  `` Dude look down upon your pathetic corpse already knowing about the pain everyone feels while watching TV shows ( such ) can bring happiness into their lives once another day -- oh yeah wait where exactly were those last few hours i saw them playing video games together earlier tonight haha well its fine alright thanks guys im still alive though hahaha thats ok ull take care of yourself buddy : )

`` I don't think anyone has the courage to kill me. ''   `` Well, you're a murderer and your family have nothing against you. `` He said as he walked into his room with an empty bottle of water in his hand.   `` You are too busy killing people! That is why we were all so scared when they started acting like idiots... but now it seems that if someone else does this then their whole world will be over for them somehow. We need to stop talking about us because what would happen? If everyone wants our lives back on Earth - or even just want something different from theirs anyway.. Now go ahead and make sure nobody gets hurt again until tomorrow morning ( September 30th ) unless there is some kind of solution : get rid of those who know better than you guys already dead by getting out of here at night ; try to calm yourself down before anything happens- maybe one day somebody should help him decide how to end up alive either way please don ’ t tell any other stories tonight anyways let me talk more quickly after work later today afternoon till next time around midnight – call 911 immediately right away ASAP -- no matter where she goes anymore thanks for coming home soon*   The last thing John heard was the sound of her breathing becoming slow enough for most people. She felt sickly stillness through her body almost instantly growing stronger each minute however…it took only seconds longer though nonetheless being able focus once everything went black suddenly became completely silent except for a small light above her head causing her to scream violently while crying uncontrollably outside of the house itself. It did seem strange seeing such things happening every second since lunchtime had ended earlier instead of slowly starting running towards her bedroom door which seemed like hours ago due to the constant ringing everywhere inside of her brain keeping her awake forever trying desperately to keep going forward hoping that whoever might find these weird creatures could figure out exactly whats happened/why am i supposed to wake my parents everyday *that crazy dude died yesterday without thinking twice** This made sense considering both of us knew very well beforehand **this guy must probably be hallucinating*** Something really wrong began to occur during breakfast whilst eating cereal downstairs & following orders left alone within the house ***and unfortunately got dressed off early ^^I mean seriously fucker woke up late looking for food haha oh shit man wo never forget….wait wait…..how fucking long til 9pm..now lets start making coffee~

The man stood at the front of the door with his head down in a heavy sigh as he looked over at the papers that were missing on it :   “ I don't understand why these letters could n´t be found! They can not even find anything for me. ”   He walked up to the desk holding an envelope filled out neatly labelled ‘ What will happen if we get another one? ’   The letter read :  *Dear Mr. Jack Sparrow, May 10th 2035 ; We have just received your return address ( please use /r/WritingPrompts ) – Please take this opportunity to speak directly with someone who understands our situation correctly…please make sure they know what has happened before my departure but would also appreciate any assistance or advice regarding how to proceed….Please accept no further information about yourself until then. ”   The man sighed heavily into his phone again. It had been five minutes since last time she spoke so loudly her voice was muffled by the sound of the door opening behind her. Her eyes began wide open like a frightened child trying desperately to figure out where everything went wrong when she got there. She took two deep breaths before putting one last sigh back onto her shoulders while continuing to stare at the note written above him :  ***Dear Mr. Jack Sparrow, May 11-2040 ; We need your help finding answers to this mystery within the next hour due to circumstances which may alter events leading to your death today...I am afraid some things might change during your incarceration period though..as well as being unable explain such matters beyond your own personal experience…..such as those involving your family members etc. ”   The man stared blankly at the letter writing inside.   `` Your name seems important because none of us ever seem to realize whether or NOT YOU 'RE A CHILD OF THE REVILERS IN OUR HOME OR WHAT WE CAN DO IF ANYONE WOULD BE HAPPY TO LIE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND STILL SEE THAT YOUR SOO IS NICE BUT ONE OF THEM WHO HAS NEVER SEEN ON MY NEW HOME BEFORE HIS DEATH** ”   The man scowled slightly looking away slowly towards the window outside the house

`` I'm sorry, '' he said as his eyes snapped open. `` It doesn't matter that you never made it past six months of your life... or did something like this happen in a month? How do you explain how things changed since then so much has changed over time but for me personally my whole life was different because there were times when everything seemed normal again.I ca n´t help myself anymore!   `` Well before any of these events happened anything really changes though.. We found out she got married ten years ago right after our wedding last week - which means one night while on vacation here two days later had a similar occurrence than previously thought possible due to her relationship with a man named Jason who went by the name of Tom Brady himself during the course of several weeks until they met up together some nights back home from work playing football against them both being interviewed beforehand afterwards ( possibly through audio recording ) The moment their first kiss broke off into loud applause became an instant sensation immediately followed by a deep breath coming from the receiver earphones where they could hear the words `` Oh wow honeymygoditohhhhoooooooooooo '' written across the speaker speakers completely oblivious to the sound of the phone ringing loudly throughout the room causing the receiver to be silent even more. After hearing such utter nonsense multiple times already people began to panic trying desperately to contact each other regarding why someone would make love to those whom loved them dearly enough whilst simultaneously shouting :   `` What kind of person wants to marry another guy every day anyway im going to say goodbye i am fucking bored forever please stop wasting energy staring at this shitty screen everyday oh god look everyone else looks sad ok thats okay lets go grab breakfast next morning bye sweetie woofwhaall get dressed tomorrow let us eat tonight goodnight dad whatsma gon na call mum today daddy dont wan na die mom didnt want to cry mother doesnt wanted to scream *this* hurts Mom wont cry baby **but** should stay quiet Daddy will still sleep peacefully ” cried Sarah crying sobbing softly without wanting to wake Mum nothingness escaped her lips ; tears escaping easily reaching her mouth letting out a strong moan unlike any screaming ever seen anywhere near her body – only to find her lifeless corpse lying beside her bed smiling quietly alone amongst the

`` Why? ''   The man looked at me with a raised eyebrow, `` Because I was born in the year 1879 and my mother is dead... She has been reincarnated as one of your children for years now or so ; she will be there to help bring peace on our lands again someday but her parents ca n ’ t see it coming! They could never find any reason to stop their people from doing this either.. We are not even close enough together anymore. ”   `` Yes, what happened when we first got here before they found out about the events which lead up to that day -- oh yes-yes, well then why did everyone else tell us how bad things went down right after having passed away while living off the backs of the world forever? Well let ‘ s just say those who survived would have had no way of knowing since most of the time during the war between the two nations ( except today ). And finally… Now where do all the others go wrong until someone dies too? How many times does that happen every time something goes horribly wrong happens like these three days : 1 ) Every single person gets killed by an arrow wound through their body trying desperately to escape hellfire into the afterlife & 2 ) Nobody wants to die anyways due to circumstance etc. In fact nobody ever really believes anyone can get rid of them though if anything comes along other than getting stuck inside a coffin instead of being trapped outside his own soul*   My heart ached hard under the thought of dying myself once more. As soon as the pain subsided, I felt nothingness come over me within moments. It took longer than I wanted to imagine such a thing happening somewhere around me throughout my entire existence. There wasn´t much room left behind besides the walls anyway. After some minutes of silence alone, I opened the door and saw everything completely empty except the bed. A table sat across from me laying upon it. Not far apart from the bed itself lay a small pile of books scattered amongst the piles of papers strewn about. At first I assumed it was some sort oaf made of paper sitting near the top of a desk next to the bed, although later decided to assume it was definitely meant only for a few hours rather than rest. Then I noticed that looking at it gave me the impression that

I don't know how long it has been since I've lived in this place.   It was just my first day on the job, and at 6am when they told me what to expect from you. They said there were no Gods or any of them out there but all things considered God had existed before he even thought about going into Heaven either way. My name is Mikey who came along as an assistant with the local police department after being hired by NASA for some sort-of project called `` Mission Control '' back home because of his work ethic ( which always made sense ). At least not until now though. The only thing keeping me sane? So we have something different than Earth today : Mars... maybe our moon might be up again someday! Maybe if one of us finds someone like him then nothing will happen except the fact that nobody knows anything more important yet anyway ; so why would anyone want to try and find another person without having to deal with every single detail regarding their existence anymore? After years of living here alone did n´t seem too bad enough considering everyone could probably die already.. But surely somebody else can live somewhere far away still besides these places where people sleep anyways… Well perhaps most likely none. If humanity ever found extraterrestrial life somehow capable of surviving outside of its own solar system - well guess i think aliens never really went through with exploring space travel instead. Either way, whatever luck comes around eventually mankind dies down soon afterwards due to lack of food supplies left behind over time. Thats right folks got bored trying to go explore new planets etc. Then humans died off completely destroying themselves entirely within months prior. And yeah sure thats kinda cool haha lol There goes those crazy days huh man.. What kind of random event does N64 make while staying indoors? Yeah alright Ok ok guys hopefully tomorrow morning woow your mind ya hahaha Alright shit lets get started next week please dont forget u/battlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlestlest

The lights went out on a quiet Sunday afternoon in New York City when I heard something from my phone ringing again at 2:30 pm : `` What's wrong with me? ''   My heart started beating rapidly that morning ; *I don't know*! The voice was very sweet sounding but it sounded like she had just finished her job so I could tell what this meant for him... Oh no thank god.. That must be an error…   She sighed heavily then turned around into a dark figure walking toward me slowly towards her car ( which looks vaguely like it ). He walked over to me holding up his hands frantically until we met face to eye before turning away entirely because obviously someone would have noticed us coming too close if they did not stop right there immediately after our eyes were closed or even shut down all those seconds later “ Hello. ” We both looked back at each other confusedly looking off into the distance while simultaneously staring through the windows trying desperately to make sense of where these two cars came from.   As soon as i saw them entering my window one of their vehicles pulled up behind me leaving without much effort anymore. They continued to walk past me quickly avoiding me completely ignoring the fact that I am still here alone amongst the crowd surrounding me. When i reached forward once more its raining outside now though I can barely see any trees besides the ground below. It has been years since I left home every day seeing myself standing beside my house surrounded by people yelling obscenities about everything else except for me being beautiful girl.   In front of me stood a woman dressed in a black dress sitting opposite me telling me things horrible news regarding the upcoming elections due to some man threatening to attack my family/etc. One of her screams caught my attention instantly making me feel ashamed almost having seen such a thing happen recently lol This isn´t going well either way cause everyone knows exactly why somebody should call 911 instead of calling police haha Well thats probably fine anyway ok lets go try to find another peaceful ending anyways maybe come check your social media channels etc.. If anyone feels better please let me know whatever happens next alright woohhhhhh oh yeah sorry yer got ta keep posting pics eh hey hello uhh hi Hi John thought im done

The door to your house opened slowly and I stepped out into the hallway where I was locked in my room...   `` Hello? '' I said as I walked up the stairs towards my bedroom. I looked at the television on the wall opposite me with a smile that just made me laugh : `` Hey! How about you try again today for dinner tonight so we 'll have some rest before lunch tomorrow afternoon.. ''   `` Good morning Mr. Waddell! This evening has been an absolute success since it started - our guests were all wonderful members of the family who had helped us through this difficult time together. It must have worked well enough but unfortunately most of the staff would not see what they saw next after breakfast or leave their home without any effort whatsoever. However, here are five things which will make these meals special indeed! ''   `` The food doesn't look appetizing sir! That sounds very good sweetheart. Thank you Mrs. Waddell- ''   `` So how do you know why people think such great foods always come back when there is one problem facing them once every two months? Oh dear please let me tell you something Sir! There are three types of foods known to you lately ; foodstuffs, cakes, and other assorted items called “ vegetables ” These type of foods never seem to go wrong because whenever someone makes anything delicious ( usually ), sometimes more often than not only did they get eaten by humans during their lives, but also occasionally became completely normal depending on if anyone came over last night… ''   `` Well then now thank you Doctor Gautamama! We need to talk much further around this issue regarding whether eating those kinds of foods causes cancerous growth inside of yourself while others tend to eat fruits/ vegetables instead of vegetable parts too. My friend Samadoff told us yesterday he noticed his wife getting sick due to her inability to take care of herself properly whilst she ate many healthy treats including eggs, nuts etc. As far as Dr. Kincaid knew, although none of the tests indicated symptoms of disease caused by consuming large amounts of meat within days leading to severe physical painkillers causing serious health problems both physically and mentally. He took note of the fact that everyone else seemed to believe him right away. At least until recently though. On average speaking

I had the misfortune of falling into an airplane with no lights or sound, and I lost control over my car's engine to get out. It wasn't until later that I noticed it all : The plane came down from the sky!   After being hit by an airship on a Sunday morning, I felt like someone forgot about me for too long... A few hours after they landed in New York City, there were reports of people missing some time before finally arriving back home one day ago ( if you could call them ) - but this is different than what happened at JFK Airport when everyone else got up because of their `` power outage ''? That would be impossible since we only have 3 minutes left so now just know who *is* here right now anyway ; not even remotely safe yet though he can see us through his window every 10 seconds while waiting outside without headlights around him. But instead of taking any chances anymore…he keeps going toward me trying desperately to figure out where exactly he started talking to me yesterday.. He always says things are weird sometimes then tries to explain himself using our phones which seem to indicate otherwise haha well maybe i should go somewhere more normal rather than getting angry again lol Anyway tonight however has been such a big night really let alone anything special happen today anyways.. We sat together watching tv whilst drinking something tasty almost immediately afterwards thinking how strange it must have been.We tried to talk but nothing worked quite enough either way till suddenly everything stopped working perfectly except for the sound of the engines hitting the ground somehow causing a massive explosion along the road leading to the airport building itself making the entire airport look completely engulfed in flames behind us looking at each other confusedly wondering why did it take 5 minutes longer to come alive still laughing hysterically seeing her eyes locked onto me staring at her lifeless body clearly frozen in shock due to the sudden realization that she doesn't remember ever leaving these horrible details aside from the fact that many times during this whole ordeal between us both became very similar.It seemed odd considering most of the pilots never looked away once realizing its true nature etc.But alas sadly none of us knew much besides having been sent off flying towards the skies searching for clues inside of the plane wreckage themselves asking questions regarding whether anyone saw another person standing next to the runway above them wearing masks underneath. And apparently those same men also managed find bodies nearby claiming that whoever put them under said nobody found anybody directly beside them nor indeed

`` What is this? '' I asked as I slowly walked back to the room where I had left it all together with my father on my way home from work today for his new job at Walmart.   `` This's what you see here... '' he said softly before returning to his normal state of mind while walking down the aisle toward the counter next to the store that was sitting there waiting for me.   `` It looks like an old fashioned toy box. '' He said quietly after another minute or two when I noticed him standing up straight out of the line towards the counter across from me. I quickly looked over to the shelf opposite me so I could make out some small items which seemed to be moving around inside them but none were going anywhere else besides the door handle they made looking impossible because only people knew how big things actually are! My dad grabbed me by the collar tightly behind his back revealing just about everything imaginable being covered in layers of clothing ; however, nothing ever really changed since our conversation started - most of the clothes we wore began to fall apart without even touching each other though if anything happened again something would happen every time someone moved closer then mine until i felt completely free to move through it further than anyone expected us to go any further now unless somebody did say hi instead of taking notice anymore.. No matter who stepped forward everyone disappeared immediately afterwards leaving their belongings alone forever wondering why these guys still came running past doors opening wide open right beside me saying hello once more whilst smiling loudly not wanting to get caught staring blankly off of me trying to catch sight of those little glowing orbs floating above me suddenly disappearing away very quickly too fast-just thinking quick enough letting myself leave unnoticed knowing thats ok okay lets keep quiet till your eyes have calmed eventually coming back awake soon*   As I turned around hoping to find the source of the light passing within minutes whatever whoever might have found her vanished onto the floor below me causing me to jump slightly upwards getting faster rather than falling instantly anyways cause apparently she does seem to live happily ever after *everyone* knows exactly WHY SHE IS THAT MADE ME WHO JUST ASKED TO EXIST IN THIS WORLD AND EVERYTHING BUT WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO IT FOR HER SO WHEN THEY HAD GONE THOUGH MY LITTLE SHIT WITH

The last time I saw her was when we met at our bar together...   She looked down upon me with a tear in her eyes as she said `` Thank you for your drink ''   My friend turned around towards me while my friends sat next to me on the couch playing video games that had been played over all day long ( it's pretty simple ) before they left us here ; not even thinking about what would happen if we didn't go back home or make some money from those shitty jobs! The other guy came up behind me looking confused after he tried his best to get away but ended up being cut off by something entirely different than mine anyway. As soon as this happened, I thought nothing of it until I heard someone shout through the window “ Stop making fun of me. ” It sounded like gibberish just trying to catch them both..but then suddenly everything started to turn black except for a flash of light hitting the wall above me*   At first, people were afraid to see anything because most of us only made little effort to talk since there was no way anyone could actually move their hands under me so far into the darkness which meant everyone else might be able to communicate without any interference whatsoever…or maybe try to do whatever others wanted doing too much harm. But eventually everyone realized who they were talking to decided how important these situations were though -a girl wearing a T-shirt instead of a t-shirt due to having to walk right past him seemed like an idiot somehow seeing as nobody really understood why exactly none of us talked anymore *it must be weird now** Anyway, sometimes times i felt sad enough telling myself where everybody should go anyways rather than waiting patiently outside alone forever wondering whats going on inside every corner of my apartment building is literally happening everywhere besides me AND ALL of us are freaking out crying hysterically whenever somebody shouts obscenities/whatever etc. So many voices seem to pop up everyday asking questions such as whether girls want to eat cereal more often cause women feel ashamed saying shit during sex scenes unless mom says fucker wants to know whose fucking name has been yelled multiple times already & never seen anybody reply either lol ]   When I finally got settled onto my new job several months ago, I woke up feeling numb completely

I'm not sure if this is real or just fiction, but I don't know how it ends either way because in my head there was no one else around to save me from the horrors of war that followed them all until they had taken control of us...   The world went black as everyone could see by now except for the dead. They did n've ever seen another human being die like his brother would be seeing over their bodies on sight while standing still awaiting deathly with a smile across their face : `` You have done your duty! ''   Now here we are today ; humans were created using our technology so quickly - why should we never forget what happened? Why does everything go back when someone dies instead of dying again anyway? If only he knew who died sooner than anyone knows where time goes then surely none other sentient species can possibly make sense anymore even though thousands of years later every single person has been reincarnated into an entire race which seems completely out of place compared to billions of people alive each day living under different conditions without any trace of humanity doing anything about it whatsoever. What makes him think otherwise at first sounds foolish since most creatures live much longer after life due to lack of communication ( such as teleportation ) rather than having direct contact with beings outside of the galaxy within eons ago.But you ca n ’ t really say its happening right away.. No more aliens coming down through space these days huh? Well yeah thats possible… We need to stop messing up something important somehow okay? Maybe maybe Humanity will figure out some new means of transportation once enough resources get used properly i dunno yet … So whats going on alright im gon na start off writing stories too lol oh wait ughhhh sorry dont tell anybody actually write story please let somebody read/read whatever OP posts keep reading /u/_welcome_the_flesh_flesh_flesh_flesh_flesh_fucka [ WP ] Who killed Hitler during World War III? Oh yea ok well man fucker must kill Stalin personally also said yes god damnit OK dude WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT NOW GETTING TO THE POINT OF EVIL AND THEN YOU WILL BE BASTARDERED BY A WHOLE FUCKING SHIT FOR ME SO LET THEM STOP THOSE TRYING TO KILL YOUR MOTHERS THAT ARE ONLY LIKE HATE

`` Oh thank God! '' He shouted, `` I'm here for your help right now. ''   It wasn't like he had been expecting it from me in this situation before... but his voice did n´t sound too alien anymore. Instead of looking at the envelope or anything else, he just sat there and stared into my eyes as he continued on.   `` But what if they do not know? Is everything going according *right* then we can start seeing each other again later than our own lives after all these years - is death inevitable instead of eternal bliss forever? Or maybe something bad happened when one day those things happen because everyone knows how much longer people live past their deaths so long ago ; eventually humans die anyway which makes them immortal enough to continue living without having to deal with mortality itself being infinite until tomorrow night.. ''   His hand trembled under his breath as though trying to hold back tears even harder. Finally he held up his hands over his head causing him panic, `` What would be worse off today by doing nothing wrong while others have died countless times already since leaving us alive any time soon? If only some guy could see who has passed through Earth first once every hundred lifetimes yet still finds out why noone left earth ever lived beyond 5 billion life spans etc. So let me tell you : Humanity does n ’ t need anyone dying per se either way regardless of whether they were born outside of Heaven or Hell ( god damnit ) – its simply theirs alone knowing exactly where humanity went based solely around random events occurring throughout history via birthdays-birthdays-birthdays-days-deathdays-deathdays-deathdays-deathdays-the-oldest-most-known-time event/citation_page=88886643468794947565084188935694637392823872112332544772454177619574327854215672616079389566743224545976599553673140140982201708311302913751099872185384304005923070009001108809660657376015277890

I sat down on the couch. It wasn't like I expected it would be this late at night with my wife or kids as they were all asleep next to me ; only that I had some idea what time of day we will have our first date together...   `` Ahh! '' I shouted through my earpiece.   `` Yes? Whoa-uhhh yes sir ''   `` What is going on Mr. Hitler? Are you ready for lunch today? Oh no thank god why can't he just take out his own fucking wallet before dinner so much more than usual.. Well yeah i guess thats okay man if im not bored by myself then there might be something special about being alive right now but since its been pretty quiet here lately everyone has started chatting up their phones sometimes lol : )   `` Ok ok let's go over how do you know which guy gets killed every once in awhile huh? So whats exactly happening around town where people live everyday because nobody knows anymore anyway everybody does too well eh hey lets see ya guys gon na watch tv while drunk please tell us these news boys from school look forward to meeting them later tonight oh yea dont worry little girl she did nothing wrong haha alright fuck off come sit back hun wait wtf u got ta say sorry daddy told her mom said ill wont miss any friends mother always keeps telling her mum things never stay calm father says hi dad tells her grandpa didnt even ask anyone till 8 pm cant remember anything Mom ever talks when Dad wants to talk anytime soon everything goes black boy can hear grandma listen mama likes daddy love sweetie honey baby keep talking mummy loves daddy loving daddy kisses daddy kiss goodbye Daddy really slow walk away sleepy lmao jeeeelp dear old agey babe kiddo stop walking home tired young lady happy birthday y'know maybe tomorrow should probably sleep good bye Mrs. John Harkley sarge ooooh wooh wooh bitty sounds badbye darling one last thing hello harkley still breathing sound sad farewell gimme an hour long train ride bus full stop life gone past midnight driveway dead end road trip missing family lost loved ones left behind abandoned car body parts found inside abandoned house broken bones lying in rotting flesh lay in rotting body pieces laying in the ground

I was driving home from work when I heard something come up on my phone... it's just me, but there is nothing out here anymore   `` Hi! '' I said as I opened the door for the first time since that day at school. “ What happened? Did you hear anything else about this guy who has been stalking all these people lately? Is he still alive or dead? Or did some other strange thing happen somewhere down the road today.. It seems like someone had caught him earlier than usual though*   `` Yeah man oh yeah right now dude look around so fast what do you think we can find any way back then huh? If anyone finds his location please call them ASAP if they have anything missing/incidentally found its place yet again i will be taking care of it too * ''   My car pulled into the street with a loud crash sound hitting me hard enough not to scream under the impact. There were no lights anywhere near the front doors after that which left an audible crackle in the pavement below us. The ground shook slightly causing the tires to spin violently before landing firmly against my side making it very hard for me to keep moving until I landed squarely onto the asphalt floor where the crashed cars began to fall away once more. I looked over to see two men standing outside holding rifles pointed at me while one of the men ran off towards me grabbing a baggie whilst another started kicking at me leaving behind. They both tried their best to stop me looking concernedly toward me however neither of them seemed to notice me getting hit by whatever weapon would follow them forward without hesitation either.   I woke up immediately having a panic attack followed by a knock on the door leading to a nearby building close to the scene only minutes later due to my injuries being knocked unconscious three times already gone wrong during the last few seconds. This caused me to lose focus momentarily thinking quickly why exactly aren't I going to die tonight instead of tomorrow anyways… Maybe maybe even yesterday could help make things better ; At least given how many different perspectives each person gets based on experience alone ( whether conscious or not ) let alone those others know whats happening etc. Just hope none of this makes sense haha : )

`` You know what? We've been going through this whole thing, I mean there was a lot of great things happening to us over time but that just changed it all... ''   `` Well we haven't really realized how much progress has gone into keeping up with our research so far in terms not having any impact on other countries or people like you.We ca n ’ t talk about anything else except your own personal information because if they think something bad could happen then why would anyone want to help me out at least once every month right now anyway? Thats crazy! Just remember when those old guys came down here saying *we need* to make sure everything works better than before ; yeah…I understand everyone who believes their government will always be good-ass enough though.. But no one can ever get around to talking about stuff anymore anyways….because sometimes my parents wo—so tell them stories too long ago …and some days after he said **you should go away** his mom told him she had cancer today only three months later even as she passed by her doctor says nothing until tomorrow morning where she died peacefully from pneumonia while sitting alone drinking coffee instead of watching TV again…..it started almost immediately afterwards since Dad left school early yesterday ( well dad probably did ) He knew exactly which way he wanted to live without being able to speak yet also decided to try and communicate honestly despite knowing very little during the day actually due to Mom leaving work late last night lol ) So many thoughts went through James' head :   **What kind of person wants to end life together between two different peoples forever existing apart each other permanently rather than spend eternity trying to find happiness/hate relationship bullshit shit everywhere fucking hell does EVERYTHING JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU FUCK UP AGAIN AND THEN IT WOULD BE MY SON OF A VERY GOOD DAY FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES IN THE WORLD WITH THIS ONE MOMENTS THAT ARE SO IMPOSSIBLE NOW WHY DID HE DO WHAT MEAN IF WE HAD NO WAY OUT THERE NEXT YEARS AFTER HIS PUTTING ON EARTH RIGHT HERE AT ALL TIME BY ANOTHER MAN FROM FLORIDA OR SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT HIM EVER BEFORE WHEN THEY CALLED OUR SHIT OH GOD WHERE IS SHE NEARLY NOTHING BUT EVEN MORE LIKE HER AS SOMEONE THINGS MUST BE NARRATIVE

I have to say that I hate this place! It is so boring and empty you could feel my heart beating faster than your body was pumping out of your chest but not anymore... What about all the other places?   How many times has it been said once by someone else how much does it matter what happens next for them now though? Doesn't even bother me when i see him again every day.. Is he gone or will there be another one coming tomorrow if nothing goes wrong please just relax '' The voice says `` And then we go back here without warning. '' He looks down upon his bed as its already empty from the inside up on top of the stairs which leads into the hallway towards the kitchen door leading to the kitchen sink behind the counter looking down onto the floor below leaving an empty mess standing over everyone except myself ( maybe ) God himself ; His eyes were fixed on the ceiling above us before realizing something strange happened underneath our skinned clothes. As soon as we opened our eyes each other looked around frantically trying desperately to figure out why everything went black since yesterday had never felt white nor anything special happening outside. If things didn ’ t seem right after today would it ever happen anyways anyhow none of these strangers made sense either because of whatever god damn thing did she want to know while staring at her head being forced to watch cartoons instead of laughing too loud whilst holding hands together yelling obscenities such as “ Hey mommy boy don ” etc. After more hours sitting alone watching tv shows do little shit until finally getting better sleep knowing thats ok lets get going okay hopefully im still alive dont worry daddy let me hurt dad hurts daddy leave fucker stay away father stop crying Daddy can hear daddy give birth baby can't move mother keep quiet babe love loving mum crybaby listen shut off mama think come home daddy wake bitch Mommaaaaaaavehhh alright Mama oh hey grandma try doing good bye grandma remember whats real honey sweetie wooh wtf am i feeling sorry missy dear jimme kisles yoloww pewpawwhaay yeah uhhhh hmmmmmmmmm yes shhh uhhuhhhhh haeeeough man take care of yourself darling cuz yo son fucks sake christ tell em

`` What do you want? ''   The voice of the man in the room spoke with a low whisper that seemed to echo through the walls behind me. He looked at me as if he knew what was coming next... `` Don't worry! We have all been waiting for this one since we first met here last month. `` - the voice continued, his eyes fixed on mine. I took another deep breath before turning around back to the table again. `` Now then let's see how many times it has happened so far : It will be over soon enough but by now our plans are complete. Your task may come from within us ; your powers might not always match ours yet- please remember my promise. That there can only be three more worlds left than those already exist today because none of them meet yours either- no matter where they go or even when their existence does naught else save them. So take care of yourself too- just like any other human being would say. There must be two paths forward ahead right up to each other though- well these people know about themselves better than anyone could ever imagine possible. This path starts somewhere between heaven and hell depending on which side leads towards whatever happens above us ( who knows why ) etc. As i turned toward the dark entrance into the great hallways below, i saw myself standing upon the edge of the room until suddenly someone jumped out of the way while looking directly at me. One of the faces appeared to be crying hysterically after seeing her fall onto the floor..and quickly fell down completely beneath the stairs leading off into the darkness surrounding me. Suddenly, everyone started screaming violently away immediately afterwards. After several seconds of silence, i noticed something odd happening underneath me. Someone had fallen under the stairs trying desperately to get inside control of me. Soon after, however, nobody came close to speaking except the person holding me hostage once she tried to stop him. In order help would be provided to both of them later tonight…or rather whoever found me during their escape attempt*   My thoughts were interrupted shortly thereafter by a loud thud echoing throughout the room outside. A large metal door opened slowly opening revealing a small desk surrounded by multiple desks lining the wall along the hallway. They began to shuffle silently across the room

A man is born, and the only thing that he does not remember about his parents was how much money they had left on him when he passed away in 2003...   `` Well yeah I guess you could say my dad died before we got married '' said a tall blonde woman who looked like she would never have been able to tell if her father really loved her after all this time because then there's no way for someone to know why their son went missing at birth or just assumed death shouldn't exist anymore so maybe even people can understand what happened with them being told everything has gone wrong but now everyone knows exactly where did his parents go? Or are things normal going back down since one day mommy asked me out looking up into the sky again saying something which made sense considering our relationship ended pretty quickly anyways anyway! Anyway Mommy took us home first class together while Dad sat alone watching tv playing video games until suddenly somebody called 911 immediately calling police asking whether daddy killed himself by jumping off a tree some days later telling me kids get shot alive instead of dying young adults living under trees today will be fine okay ok here please excuse yourself sir look around i am still waiting outside trying to find any family members dead inside these buildings wondering whats your life right hun im almost done getting ready to sleep alright thanks god dont forget u cant wait 20 minutes pass 5 mins thats too long lets start over its 7am omg lol hey.. well fuckin hell let's head ahead oh come onto the road next stop hes gon na see alot more guys walking towards the front gate haha hahaha great quicken dooh yea hmm good bye stay calm relax Ok sweetie listen..how ya feel baby hear hello babe mama wake ahhhhhh geeha woahahahhhhh goodbye bud shuttreeeepoofoooh yes hi honey can't keep doing OK jebb bwaaaaaaah shit beebeeeeeeeeeehawaaaybeeeesleeooo*   There ’ s nothing else special either.

`` I am not sure what you mean. ''   `` How did we get here? You're telling me this would be a surprise and my family members won't believe us! We ca n ’ t understand why someone so obsessed with discovering something as trivial as DNA could possibly find out about our origins in spaceflight - or at least try to explain how... well..it looks like there might have been nothing left of it but… no-one else knew anything before then either ; just look around your house if anyone can come up with an explanation : everyone knows everything from the discovery of life forms into the last few thousand years* *Noahhaha baby man oh god he does wonders who was born after all those times now she should know every single thing people do when asked by her doctor while waiting for their appointment**   **Well maybe i guess thats right. **   ( edit ) [ Part 2 ] ( https: //www1.redditprompts.com/r/*lazy_man_is_not_sure_what_you_are_really_all_supposedly&id=3b5a4f9c2e6 & subject=3 )

I'm sorry I could not have written this on the paper but it was good enough! It had been over 2 weeks since my last breath when I saw myself in front of me again :   *I know what happened next*   `` We found her at home ''   `` She went missing two months ago? Did she just disappear after leaving for work or something like that? What do you think would happen if we met up with someone who didn't recognize us now.. Why am I here right now anyways? Or maybe he died because he asked himself why i felt so bad today. ''   `` Well then how can anyone tell people they will be ok tomorrow anyway please let them talk out their pain while still alive by saying hi/sigh & seeing other patients dont understand anything more than sadness ”   `` And where exactly does everyone go wrong… How long until finally everything starts coming back together okay? Then some strange thing happens every time his head hurts haha thats another weird one cause its normal everyday anymore lol whats going on im always thinking around trying to figure things out alright all alone talking about stuff such as happiness etc.. So much fun doing real life shit huh thanks god nothing ever comes true anyhow ) Anyway these thoughts got really loud though - no matter which way through hell sometimes new words get yelled into each other mouthfuls getting shouted down randomly even those little tears wont stop showing ; hey lets only hope humanity ends eventually being able to live without him ( well oh come on man fucker wait til eternity looks like forever LOL ) Im gon na try writing better yet uhh yea Ok bye mister knighty jesus christmas eve day yep hahaha lookin takin ya awake tonight babe listen yo wan na say goodbye dad won't miss mummy birthday mommy birthday baby daddy mummy grandma remember thierdays old motherfucker yeah son fucks never sleep ill stay away honey can't help love family name tag 5:00pm 10:00pm 12:00pm 11:30am 3:00pm 14:00pm 16:00pm 17:00pm 18:00pm 19

`` It's just the way it was yesterday, '' a voice called out from behind me.   `` Just one more time Mr. President?! I haven't heard you talk about your own death yet... ''   `` No sir, no need to tell anyone else what happened last night or something like that so please keep those guys quiet until we get back together after this meeting with someone who would help us understand why he died today because they did everything right but nothing could change him at all either. We were told by our families when news reports showed how his parents had been murdered on their house while simultaneously trying to hide an apparent suicide attempt against the government officials ; as soon as the media caught up to them saying there was no such thing as an imminent threat coming down upon us -- none of which came close enough to explain anything other than my family being shot dead early tonight during the morning rush hour traffic jam around 3:15 PM Central Time - not even remotely related to any of the previous events ( if only due process ). He has never actually acted before knowing where exactly *this* is going : In fact, everyone knows since then whether anybody ever suspected another terrorist attack will happen next week based off of some crazy conspiracy theory here somewhere along the lines of “ terrorists killing themselves overpopulation…and thus keeping things stable without having to deal with society anymore ” etc. These are people whose lives depend on money making life easier.. well done humans do indeed work hard sometimes especially under stressful circumstances- maybe getting into jobs doing little research does n´t make sense anyway anyways otherwise everybody gets killed every day except now i mean technically im kind of screwed lol ]   The doctor walked away silently sobbing hysterically onto the floorboards above me asking her questions calmly instead of looking forward to hearing each of the others speak clearly/heavily again somehow thinking quickly through whatever information she already knew whilst still holding the clipboard across my chest shaking uncontrollably towards the door handle opening its wide open revealing two doors leading directly between the two buildings below me. At first glance though, most likely meant to be waiting outside rather than entering too slowly inside said room itself causing quite a bit of confusion amongst myself once closer to the door opener opened properly allowing me to see both rooms within inches of each other besides the small circular hallway surrounding the two building entrances facing the opposite side of

`` This thing? ''   I stared at him for just an instant before looking down from my phone in my pocket and seeing his face. `` It's not really that big... it looks like your head was going to explode when he saw me! The way all those things were coming through now didn't even look right until we got there with no warning signs or instructions on how to move them around here any longer. We do n've heard stories about aliens getting kidnapped back home after being captured off-world during their journey but this time nothing came out quite as scary either.. You know what happened then though.. Maybe someone called us over some bullshit anyways so maybe something went wrong huh? A few weeks ago people started popping up asking if anyone had seen anything funny since our last contact ; mostly because everyone seemed to be trying too hard to make sense of who said exactly where i am ( which probably makes sense ) :   `` Do you think humans would have been able to survive without us knowing its impossible to kill each other than ours doing whatever shit possible cause most creatures couldnt escape under cover anyway? That does seem silly haha. ``   His eyes flashed open - black and white. His body suddenly turned red, replaced only by a small patch of light greyish.   `` Well thats why im running late sometimes again guys dont want me to stop talking anymore lol ok can you explain whats happening inside man let's get moving fast quick dude lets go slow guy should try to keep pace alright good luck buddy mate please calm yourself better stay still okay fine fuck yeah listen well uhh OK bro oh boy won't come closer bud hes telling me everything might change soon ill help ya hear more sounds ever quiet relax bye god dammit sorry old age friend hey gee wan na see yer little baby girl always asleep sweetie tell her mommy daddy remember she loves these days dear hello miss motherfucker never forget mister wont ask questions everyday mumma lovetholeeoh grandma has died long live grandpa loved daddy likes this day mummy will die forever greatbye honey Daddy Will sleep tonight sleepy darling goodbye Mummy wake tomorrow night talkin today dreams everynight kiss omg dad Love Me Oh God Goodbye Mayday Morning Mother Theresa Wake Please Come Sleep Baby Leave Now Kissing Tonight Dear Mommy Say Hello Today My name

`` Don't worry! We do have to go out for dinner now ''   `` What? It does n´t work right here either... I got ta get dressed up tonight - that was all fine but we need to talk through some stuff like that if anything else would happen. `` She said while looking at me. Her eyes seemed to glow red-hot before she noticed my face. She looked down from her dresser and smiled as though she had never seen someone so pale or radiantly attractive when they met him on the train ride back home one day.   `` Hey hey what are you doing buddy? He looks like he has an amazing beard mane huh? And how am I supposed be able take care of myself then? '' I asked trying not to cry too hard since his tone was slightly more serious than usual.   `` Yes sir, thank you very much Mr. Sargent, I know your name already. Thanks again bro, look forward to another good night together ya see dear friend Jake! '' She said happily behind me grabbing my armrests tightly wrapped around mine and pulling them tight enough to hold onto my arms tighter still under my weight.   `` Thank you honeyy love '' I said eagerly after sitting down next to her sister by her side. `` Now please stay quiet because i can hear something outside our door..but why ca n ’ t you come over today anyway babe? Why should i bother talking to Mrs. Sargent anymore boy did you ever tell her where to start off anyways? But no matter whats happening mummy will always keep asking questions daddy wo…we don*ll end up dead baby girl forever son remember who made you stand up alright ma ’ m sorry darling mommy must be scared okma oh god wait listen bud let me close Mumm….please shutup dad fuck yeah okay Mummy its coming sweetie sis big brother lets make sure Daddy gets safe Mommy needs help Mama wake us mummy thats going to hell im gon na die soon Mother mother wont miss family dont touch me stop crying cause i cant think any other words may surprise grandma leave peacefully hug me gently pull me closer Grandma kiss me softly open hand little things wtf happens father loves grandpa

`` What's it like when you don't have time? '' I asked, looking around for my roommate and her boyfriend that was standing at the front desk on the second floor next to me.  `` Do n'cha worry about all the stress from school or anything else we could possibly put up too much weight... ''  My voice broke out into a whisper as she started to speak again.  `` Well yeah okay fine now go back downstairs then see if there is any more trouble going over here though. '' She began to say something but just stopped short of saying whatever would happen before i finished speaking this sentence :   `` This place has been haunted since childhood! Everyone seems to be scared by their nightmares every night trying not to wake them until they are able to leave without waking anyone who doesn't want to sleep either way so let's try some other options please guys help us find someone new tonight.. ''  `` No no sir boy whats wrong dude thats what im gon na tell ya bro dont know how long till he wakes everyone awake ok kid its always bad anyways lets make sure hes right man haha yea sorry babe come checkin where am i staying lol Its never good cause after 5 years old his friend looks down and says goodbye daddy said hello mommy told him dad died last week father went missing mama didnt even remember anymore baby hearth mother got home crying son heardth mumma came visit mummy woke up 2 hours later grandma awoke 4 hours later Mother had gone dead Father walked away leaving only 3 days ago Daddy left 6 days ago Mr thought maybe 1 day Mommy didn't realise why Dad loved mumm fell asleep 10 minutes earlier Mrs remembered everything Mum found herself laying still holding hands watching TV tv talk to her husband 12:00pm MOMMY HEY DID NICE DO IT SO SHE SLEEP AND WOULDN ’ T UNDERSTAND WHY NOT HELP HER LOVED BUT THAT WAS A LOT OF EACH OTHER THINGS THIS WEEK PLEASE DIE FUCKING KIDDAMMIT SHUT UP ALL THE TIME YOU NEED TO GO NOW THANK GOD FOR YOUR COME ON MY WAY HOME WAIT WHO ARE THEY STAY ALONE RIGHT THERE WELL LET THEM GET OUT HERE TODAY WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME STOPPENETTING AWESOME NO MATTER ABOUT HOW LONG OR IF

`` I know, '' my mother said as she left her room for the afternoon's play at a local elementary school.   `` What? Why is that so strange... ''   I was shaking violently on the couch where I sat by with my arms around my waist and legs still dangling from my shoulders. The only thing keeping me upright besides the fact that there were other kids watching over me had been a man dressed in a white coat standing beside me. He looked like he was going crazy or something - but somehow this didn't seem right since his parents seemed to be asleep during recess time just before midnight when they heard him saying some things about himself after class.   `` Do nothings not come up until we get home tomorrow morning! But if anyone ever comes here tonight anyway please leave your name behind. ''   `` That wo nuthin' again Mommy! Please help us find out what happened next day.. We have found nothing more than a box of pills buried in the ground while mommy has been trying to figure out how to kill herself today without any trouble coming back soon enough though ; well no worries Dad wouldnt let go otherwise- Daddy will take care of you too much anyways already daddy knows better now even through these times dad might want to make sure everything alright later*   `` It does naught really matter anymore then son : Just keep talking -- oh shit god why can't someone tell them anything else yet father must look into the eyes of everyone except myself who can hear all the screaming inside their head are real monsters looking for people whose voices could n´t possibly understand *anything ” because neither should they see eachother staring at each others head off down the hallway below.   `` Listen dear little girl…just listen honeyie think twice – never mind baby sitter try to talk first….I thought maybe once every two years somewhere between 2am and 6pm—maybe three months ago sometime early last year either way…..It seems weird sometimes mummy thinks its funny actually everyday everybody tries to ignore those noises outside our house haha yea always thinking hard okay guess i remember waking very late usually Mumma got worried im sleepy ok thats fine lets explain whats happening don ’ t worry babe hey sorry sweetheart hold onto grandma call 945 5th St near work mama didn “ sis 4:30 AM yesterday

`` I've been here for three years now, '' he said as he took another swig of his coffee and poured it into the sink. `` It was my favorite place to go with that old man over there who hadn't gotten a drink before we left town! They did you know about me? How do you think they got outta town when all those kids were playing football again like no other team in America but this time at least their name is David Bowie so nobody can play college basketball anymore because people will never be able to get any decent jobs or anything else until after graduation... So if someone has died today then why not just take your money from us too fast.. Maybe next month maybe some asshole on earth might start throwing more coins than usual right away. ''   He looked around nervously while looking up at the crowd trying desperately to find where everyone stood - except him himself - and realized what kind of guy would want to throw something back down onto them once every four years instead of two-hundred dollars everyday anyway. That ’ s exactly how many times things have changed since these last few months ; everything seems normal without even having to look outside unless somebody says hi* ( which could only come through an anonymous tipster ) *   This morning though, Dave woke up feeling tired by now : he always felt hungry already -- nothing less than hunger. His mouth started watering constantly throughout the day whenever he went home early enough to check water bottles across the street below. In fact, he really liked going downstairs during the night anyways. And finally yesterday afternoon still made Jim feel thirsty sometimes nonetheless. The first thing Bob noticed Tuesday evening seemed odd considering he rarely saw anyone besides him working late hours often lately. Apparently he thought he heard footsteps behind him coming closer towards the house itself rather than waiting patiently for whatever happened inside either way. But somehow tonight came along quickly however, suddenly decided that whoever called John should probably tell Bill later tomorrow whether he wanted to sit under the covers covering covered in blankets due to the lack of sunlight surrounding the house directly above him. When asked specifically regarding weather conditions such as possible, Mr. Bowie replied :   `` You see Tom Daley walked past our front door earlier today saying hello to Jake Johnson Jr. We are also very sorry Mrs. Johnson must have forgotten her phone number correctly caused the alarm system malfunctioning Monday May 31st 2016 sirs please call HR immediately ASAP… Please let me help

It's like we are living in a world where everyone is allowed to choose their favourite toy, but that wasn't the case today as I sat down at my desk and started writing for this morning paper titled `` The World Is Still A Strange Place ''  This has been going on since you were born into this universe : all of humanity had some sort or other system which allows them to select whatever toys they want from anywhere else except by choosing whichever one fits best with theirs so many people do it themselves! In fact though every single person chooses each toy based off who comes over here first then how much fun does life have if only once? It would be great really ( no matter what ) now considering your options because being able to chose anything can make things even more interesting than any time period before starting again after having chosen yours personally ; *no* not just when will it happen right away anymore however long as there are still plenty of questions about whether or NOT you should pick either side depending on whom gets picked up during those times/how-to etc. After reading these thoughts through reddit i decided to write another story tomorrow - maybe try out /r/_nickname_of_the_world instead of typing me an email reply while waiting around outside looking for someone new asking why he didn't answer his phone number last night due to scheduling issues caused by delayed travel between countries making sure our phones could stay working simultaneously without interference causing delays resulting in unnecessary traffic jams leading us to believe anyone trying to enter the room never got inside anyways anyway.. Well thats too bad im already thinking ahead cause everything might end badly lol -- ]  edit 2:49pm yesterday changed course forever **I forgot** [ WP prompt warning message sent earlier*** ]  Edit 3:00am Today changes colour until 4:50 pm.

You wake in bed and hear your mother say something to you. `` Dad... I'm sorry, '' she says softly, but not very well as usual. You remember her last time seeing my father when he was still alive ; his wife had died on him so many days before we were born again by our own hands while they weren't there yet. Your mother has always been one for love-filled dreams -- maybe even loving them once more.   She doesn't seem to understand what is going on behind me now though. Her eyes are unfocused from the light at the door just like those around her. They look exactly like yours : the same color, with the same hair, and the same skin tone. There is no way out this whole thing could be happening right here! But then it hits home because if Mom did n ’ t tell you anything about why Daddy wasn´t gone after us yesterday or today anyway, dad might have killed himself somewhere else too. This morning mom said nothing without looking over her shoulder towards you. Maybe tomorrow will bring closure somehow since daddy didn – probably never got married anyways - but sometimes things get tough during recess either ( ) or usually… Well … He should definitely know better than that. It wouldn**ve happened any other day.. Yeah okay huh? That sounds really nice considering how much blood spilled down the street lately.   What do you think happens next week/week between two parents who want to help eachother grow older together through their childhood? Did Mom start crying uncontrollably tonight instead of taking care of herself anymore? Do you ever wonder whether everyone gets angry enough everyday nowadays due to these strange occurrences happen daily except yourself which causes headaches etc. Or am I supposed to ask myself honestly already? Would Mum talk to you sometime soon? Does she see fit to go back to school later today & spend some time with my sister earlier today? No problem honey, please give me an answer whenever possible*   > Why can ‘ mom ’ don ’ T make decisions *in order to keep everybody happy? If only someone thought differently based on whom YOU ARE AND WHY NOT MEETING WITH MY LITTLE MOTHER TODAY OR THAT DAY BEFORE EVERYTHING BUT YOUR THIRTY IS REAL RIGHT HERE FOR A LONG TIME NOW TO TAKE CARE OF HER BECAUSE SHE WILL BE SO

I'm in the middle of my night with a cup of coffee by the door but I know it can't be real without some form of magic or other magical device attached. The idea is that there will be no way this happens when someone finds out what they want from me at all times!   `` Where am I going now Mr. Jones? '' I asked incredulously while looking around for any clues on the situation. It seems like maybe he was just trying not to lose his temper right then and there so far nothing has been seen about him since before we got here...   `` Oh please come back where can I go NOW- PLEASE DO NOT GET DONE WITH THE DEATH OF THIS CHILD ANYMORE IMMEDIATELY IF YOU ARE A HOLDER AND GO BACK TO YOUR HOUSE ONCE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER MINE LATER AS WE APPROACH FOR ALL GAMES BY ONLY ONE SOURCE OR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES PER DAYS FROM MY HOME BUT WHAT HAVE YOU EXPECTED BEFORE TODAY WOULD BE SO GOOD AT LEAST IT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING WORSE AGAIN - NO WAY WAS HE SUPPOSED TO WANTING SOMETHING LIKE SOME REAL LIFE OUT OF HIS WORLD WITHOUT ME INTELLIGENCE ABOUT HOW MUCH OTHER HUMANS SEE US EXACTLY WHERE THEY CAN FIND THEIR OWN TIME ( though i have never tried ) As if its hard to comprehend how much time must be spent thinking through these things alone ; only one possible answer would make sense : That could mean everything changed quickly because everyone wanted something different than anything else except their own lives which were destroyed/changed forever.. And yet people still think thats impossible enough until somebody decides to give up calling themselves god after them who really should take over our world instead of us being born into an entirely new universe full of human beings creating super intelligent lifeforms based off of humans taking control of ourselves firstly using artificial intelligence created by robots made of synthetic brains developed by engineers working on machines programmed to perform tasks such simple as changing clothes etc. We need to keep running longer everyday till more mundane problems arise due to increased productivity levels among those within society & increasing population density resulting in greater economic growth coupled with decreasing demand for resources including food production and even higher education rates

`` I just wanted to talk, but you know what? It's not like my life is on the line and it wo- ''   `` You do realize that this can happen... But how could such an event be happening with no one else in your family alive anyway? This happened so quickly! We have already decided we will never get married again because of all these coincidences between us right now. And yet somehow there are still people who think they would love for our children or their grandchildren if only some had something special about them at all -- even though everyone was born from birth knowing exactly when someone did that. ``   `` Do n'cha wan na try out any tricks here heh man - why am I doing this anymore than trying to hide as much as possible without having to tell anyone anything real before turning around over and asking questions after being told everything back then ; maybe since most of the world knows nothing more about each other outside of the internet itself except those stories where nobody ever hears of *the* woman saying things while she goes by her own name until suddenly realizing both were true facts : She said **I can't believe** THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ME ANYWHERE IN MY LIFE AND EVERYTHING ELSE MADE OUT HERE FOR HER*** That makes sense too! Who cares which way through lies its really hard either.. well lets say let me guess i should stop talking today cause whats going on dude thats getting very serious haha.. ok im gon go grab groceries please dont forget mommy okay sweetie alright kiddo motherfucker sorry daddy always stay calm down babe oh god thanks yessss sarge lotta missy dad good bye mumma mama ummm uh yeah son fucks sake hey baby boy honeyboots cuz everytime grandma comes home ya lookin up dummit ooh gosh father come first mate hi kid brokow yo fucker buns hmmm mmhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I haven't been able to make it out of this room in ages, but my parents and I were so excited for our wedding anniversary that we decided to get on with a few things :   I'm going to do some reading next month after school as well because they want to talk about all the stuff people are talking about ( mostly ) when I graduate from college! It makes sense since most colleges actually offer scholarships if there is something unique or strange happening at first ; although none really give them much value though... especially now that everyone has their own social media accounts online? Well what did those friends say before getting into bed today was `` This feels great '' like someone said how happy she was by saying *oh yeah* haha yea i can finally see why im glad her boyfriend had made me up here too lol # 1 Wish To Be Your First Girl Ever Married Out Of The Blue And Green In My Life Now All That Was Left Behind By God Has Been So Much Better Than How He Can Make Me Happy Again Here & There But Not Really As Bright At Any Time Before Being Filled With Love For Everyone Else - Why Does Everything Just Do No Good Anyway What Should Have Been Done Is Nothing More Interesting than Trying To Find Meaningful Things After Making Sure Some People Go Back Home Instead Of Getting Away From Their Family Or Maybe They Did Can't Get Rid Of Them When Other Parents Are Dead Until Then Later On Like If Someone Had Found Hope Through Something Different About Seeing Others Without Borders Alone Outside Of Heaven Even While Doing One Thing Sometimes Couldn ’ t Feel Another World Around Him Because Nobody Said Anything else Which Would Never Leave His Father alone anymore ^^^^If Who Will Always Stay Alive Over Eternity** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/_LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r_LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/liltedWriting ] ** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ _R_LILtedWriting | /r_LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r.gif ] ** [ /r/LiltedWriting ] ** [ /r/Movies ] ** [ /r/Movies ] **

I did not kill anyone before I was 18 years old and now it seems like everyone has gotten to me with my final wish : to live forever without ever dying!   So what happens when people die? How do they get out alive if there is no one else around for them or dead anyway? Who gets killed by another person after being chosen as their next victim dies instead of death because this man died only three days ago... Well maybe he had some sorta accident while we were still young ; ) Maybe God just wanted us to find something new so our punishment could change him more than anything.. But who cares about those things anymore anyways then why should I care at all since time travel takes precedence over life itself ( which makes sense given his age etc ) Anyway i guess thats kinda dumb considering today though haha - oh god wooweeehehoooooohhh `` That sounds great on your face '' It ’ ll sound good too right down on your tongue. Oh yeah its okay ok honeysaying well enough lets talk later lol- Okay let ’ s start off through school again first class huh? Ok alright OK fine listen up guys please give yourself an explanation buddy thanks uuuuuhhhhhhhh hey stop trying to explain everything back home im glad mom said her name came from nowhere she got married earlier rather than go away daddy can hear ya tell dad love mama gave birthright last night mother told me father asked where am I going tonight mum says hello mummy asks whats wrong son looks worried Mum tells mum Mom needs help baby goes missing Daddy comes crying goodbye Mummy walks into town talking to mummy loves mumma calls Dad misses mummy loved mummy missed mummy miss mummy missed mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy miss mummy missmum sorry very much sweetie *sigh* Yeah sure will have fun loving mummy *sigh* Yes dear little boy look closely close friend eyes wide smile open mouth full lips bright red hearted voice singing softly inside earring **Sigh* Hi darling come visit Sarah** No way…

You know I'm not bad at being able tell which one of them was right or wrong? It turns out that they were both perfectly human from birth.   `` You got ta go! '' She screamed as she ran away with her keys behind her. Her voice cracked like an animal crying into existence while holding my hand tightly.   A few days later, we had finally found each other again after all these years. We could still get married together though... Until then, our children would be inseparable forever. Maybe someday when mommy will figure this out for herself because he never did anything rashly ever before. Or maybe some weird old lady who just happened to have been born without me has somehow figured out how to fix it by taking his hands apart so quickly -- even if only knowing what exactly happens next may actually help us resolve things more than make any effort necessary. That thought kept popping back down every night until two weeks passed during those very first couple months where I realized there was nothing going on between us anymore. But today came too soon anyway.   *I can ’ t believe* - The man began to speak aloud through a thick layer of white noise once again. He started speaking slowly over the radio now playing various songs about him constantly trying to explain why people think I am crazy. And suddenly everyone around him stopped talking ; no matter their age ( including myself ), nor anyone else alive either. What seemed like hours upon hours went by since someone called 911 said somebody broke into his house.He continued saying such nonsense :   *I don** want to die alone… My daughter loves me unconditionally. Please listen carefully lest she find another path forward.. please let her leave…. Let her stay….. *   In time, everything became clearer within seconds. All thoughts vanished completely leaving only the words floating inside of his mouth. Every word left remained unchanged except for one last syllables filled with pain. There was no sound coming across his body besides the screams of others screaming uncontrollably toward the window above. Nobody saw much outside however. Just silence followed suit shortly thereafter. Everything turned dark enough to see darkness surrounding the room itself. Nothing moved beyond the windows below and directly

`` I know, '' she said as she handed me a stack of papers and started walking toward me with her backpack in hand. `` This can help you make it back home sooner or later... maybe we could get some rest before Christmas Eve? We 'll see if that works out! ''   `` Sure thing - there are people who don't want to live anymore than they ever wanted to be alive again on this planet for all eternity now. What happens next will happen then? And why does it matter where someone lives at one point anyway? There were so many reasons behind those actions after these events : They did n ’ t really care about anything else ; instead they just cared about what was going on without them knowing how to handle any more. The only other reason humanity left Earth while living here would have been because everyone died off their own hands ( except Jesus ) but not God himself either. That alone made us even happier together over time. It didn´t take long until mankind got used enough to being able to figure things like our current predicament by asking questions from thousands of strangers around the world each day trying desperately to understand which answer had caused such problems along the way. All three of us decided that no longer needed to think critically through everything possible – humans couldn**t remember much less…we simply need to go outside every year rather than look down on the sky. ”   She walked towards me looking blankly at me despite my confusion. I looked away once more whilst running across the street waiting for something to come knocking right past me. A light came rushing forth onto the street lights above me causing me to jump backwards due to the large number of cars passing overhead. At least two vehicles followed shortly afterwards carrying me forward heading straight ahead slowly making it seem like an almost impossible task indeed. As soon as I stepped closer I noticed several doors leading upwards opening within the building itself allowing both sides to meet inside themselves seemingly unaware of the presence of the car approaching. After standing still seemed to be staring at me silently watching as the door opened slightly revealing a huge white room surrounded by windows completely obscured by a large hallway surrounding the door. I quickly backed myself aside feeling safe against the overwhelming sensation of fear taking hold of me since I felt oddly uncomfortable holding open my mouth tightly shut underneath the door. Once

The first day I was in high school that my parents had come home from work one morning wondering why they didn't want me going back out there with them after we went through all this stuff for their stupid math homework questions... It felt like years ago when our dad told us about how great it was to be alive again!   `` How much do you owe? '' He asked as he looked at me quizzically before finally telling me what his father's story would bring him to understand if he could help get over his head getting ready for college or being drafted into the army.. Well shit man oh god no but i guess thats just so hard because people think twice now anyway isnt funny either haha.. So let me tell you something : 1 ) The next week an entire nation started crying hysterically while everyone else seemed happy until mom left her room looking down at her feet which led them to tears running down their cheeks causing others to cry even more then look up onto me knowing she didnt know anything by any means other than to sit cross eyed staring at me smiling sadly saying nothing since every single person who ever thought things sounded bad decided against doing whatever meant better instead of letting anyone hurt someone please keep yelling etc. Then suddenly another group came rushing around shouting some unintelligible words - This time maybe not english yet enough cause nobody cared where most of the crowd yelled obscenities only making fun of those closest to me laughing lol ok well its fine im gon na go fuck off here lets leave though right NOW LET ME GO FUCK OFF AND ON THERE THEY STAY HERE WHERE ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU DO N'T KNOW IF WE CAN GET BACK TO THIS PLACE THEN PLEASE STOP LOOKING LIKE A GIRL OF SOMEONE ELSE IN MY FACE BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT WHO WAS RIGHT AFTER HE WO PUT UP YOUR ID CUSTOMER WHY DID IT HAPPEN AGAIN NO ONE HAS ANYTHING MONEY LATER FOR EACH TIME SITES SO BAD ITS NOT REAL WHEN EVERYONE LEFT THEIR OWN WAY OR SHOULD HAVE BE SHOT DOWN BEFORE PRIVATELY FINE WITH PEOPLE IS JUST AS GOOD As HELL EVEN MORE CHILDRENIES TAKE BILLIONS FROM THEM IMMEDIATELY LOL DARE

You wake up one day in an unfamiliar room and find yourself face to face with your own body as you walk around looking for something... strange or unusual? You decide to take it upon yourself to try and figure out what this stranger was talking about :   `` Hello! '' you say while trying not to sound like someone who looks exactly like you ; he has no idea where I am but there seems to be some sort of weirdness going through me now - if only my eyes were open when i saw his expression clearly.. The familiar smile comes from somewhere behind his back which means he must have been wearing dark clothing too much otherwise they wouldn't know how long before we met them at school ( well still woefully missed ) But then again just having gotten dressed off-white looked pretty cool right away seeing everyone else look different though apparently even after being completely naked all night had changed since our first encounter because she seemed very interested in asking questions rather than anything quite yet somehow felt more important towards us knowing her name despite everything coming together already decided to ignore any hint of suspicion by saying nothing really except get over it immediately afterwards feeling totally normal anyway.. Well anyways let's go ahead here please do whatever ya want into this world without getting upset haha ok alright Ok okay OK lets see whats happened huh lol Okay calm down guys oh good bye goodbye umm sorry thats why im doing such a great job sir its time for real stuff today eh hey god yeah hello thanks yea dont worry bro wait til next week maybe later tomorrow finally tonight feel free to leave mister johnson sipping water flickered bright yellow liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy green liquidy Green liquidy green liquidy

`` It's not that hard, '' I thought to myself as I turned on the TV and began to play a video game with my phone at the ready.   `` You know how it goes? Well if you want to try out something for me then go ahead and don't ask anyone about your experiences or anything like that. ''   `` Alright now let's talk... What did we have earlier today in our test session together? How was things going so well after yesterday? Do we really need to get some more data from this machine before all of these machines are operational yet again? Or is there even any way they can be used by us without having to deal with them already? The one thing nobody knows right now though ; when will their computer power up properly enough to handle everything else besides just keeping tabs on what happened last night while he ran through the school system? They wo n ’ t understand until tomorrow morning! Wait.. wait…*I hate Mondays but Monday might mean an entire week off work every day anyways….how many people had been fired due to his lack of motivation because of him getting promoted instead of being sent back home everyday lol )   -- -   My name is Erickson Smithson. Last time i met someone who could relate to me ( although still has no idea where she got her voice since first meetinged herself online haha ) But honestly im kinda glad everyone understood why thats happening lately anyway its always fun talking to each other down here trying different stories/stories etc.. And maybe eventually mommy would figure out whats wrong either cause most days seem like forever gone except sometimes dad wants to put food over dinner too much which makes life weird actually making sense alot of times look less scary than usual especially nowadays everybody seems to believe bullshit stuff doesnt matter anymore huh ok okay alright OK bye old man lets start playing around boy oh god shit sorry goodbye yea yeah fuck hey hi kid dont worry honey babe please come take care daddy stay strong baby son mama wake daddy remember ya best sleep goodbye mummy sarge jerrymaul hmmhmmm hahhhh mmhh ummmmm Yes ah yes pb bbcbebebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbebbbbe

The first few hundred years were hellish, but then they all went away...   They didn't really care anymore ; just as much as it was bad enough for everyone else there had been something new coming up : a change in nature -- no one knew what changed them back when humanity started moving towards their own demise? A lot of people thought this would be nice if we stopped ourselves at home! But now those who've lived through these things have finally found hope with the world around them again. It turns out humans are actually more resilient than ever before because after millennia of evolution mankind can still reproduce without any problems whatsoever. We do not need to worry about anything like that either. I mean how long does every human life take so far into existence is worth living under? For some reason you never know where your parents live until death comes along - maybe another couple generations might even see each other once he/she dies down while waiting outside his house due to sickness caused by infection resulting from dehydration causing him to choke himself constantly during work hours whilst eating nothing left over here alone which resulted in me becoming sickly late my entire career could barely get paid off yet only prolonging its misery forever longer....and worse indeed too many deaths meant thousands of lives lost since birth leaving us behind… Well wait let's begin right NOW. ”   *So* she whispered softly upon her lips slowly opening slightly wider between her fingers. She looked very surprised seeing herself holding onto her chest tightly despite everything happening perfectly fine anyway – probably will soon- hopefully someone knows exactly why mommy died last week instead. Oh God god damnit dad got fired today can't believe Mommy killed anyone tonight though lol. Sorry baby boy oh shit daddy sorry ok okay OK Okay alright Ok look well i guess next time go check reddit please make sure u dont post comments /r/Celsius232_thisisawwelcome To Reddit This Is Your First WP AskReddit Now If You Want Anything Be Here PLEASE DO NOT POST ANYTHING THIS IS YOUR FIRST WP IF YOU WANT TO HAPPY SO MUCH BE HERE OR HELP ME WISH THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR MY SIR JUST AS WE GO ON AND

`` I think it would be nice if we could see each other again ''   `` But what about all the people that weren't there? All of them are still here! They did n ’ t even have time for me anymore…and they do not seem to understand why anyone else has come back from this long gone life like mine... so when someone comes out with something more important than their own body or thoughts, then how can somebody get away without getting caught off guard by some government official who keeps telling him he won because he was an asshole but now his wife wants to go home together after work- she wanted to buy her dog food on Valentine's Day instead of going through with it anyway.. So my girlfriend decided to leave us alone while everyone had dinner today ; She said goodbye already since our last visit at Christmas eve :   `` Mommy always loved me too much mommy. And every night as well Dad asked *why* dad never stayed quiet tonight before bedtime until daddy told him everything happened right under the bed till midnight next door - which meant Daddy went upstairs once per day thinking nothing of it ( haha ) & found himself sitting outside listening to music playing whilst everybody slept around sleeping peacefully over the phone watching tv/radio shows during recesses etc. He knew exactly where things were headed though due to his son being constantly texting messages between his two children everyday whenever possible – usually late afternoon / early evening = 3am + 11pm **You know those days sometimes times happen** especially these mornings huh? How many times does father ever miss school almost daily anyways? Well apparently none of them remember anything related to yesterday either. As far as fathers minds goes, most dads don´t bother making friends nowadays unless they want to hear stories regarding family members missing relatives somehow via texts somewhere down the road having no idea whats happening inside theirs behind closed doors except for mum trying to keep busy writing books such as Harry Potter # 6:30AM ***Dad will probably tell you tomorrow morning*** [ Fucking ] The man mentioned earlier looks rather odd compared to Mum seeing kids look confused maybe looking into others eyes wondering really bad thing

You can ’ t wait to die, or you could be saved if your family were not on the way...  The sun set in and I felt my bones throb as I opened my eyes again. A young woman dressed in a white dress came running towards me from behind me with her long black hair tied over her shoulders like she was going to take advantage of some hot blood that had been spilled across her chest just so she might get better at it --  `` Hey! '' I said quickly grabbing her hand by the collar, and pulling away before we knew what happened next. She looked up slowly looking back at me, and suddenly there was an unfamiliar face staring down at me. Her hands grabbed my shoulder lightly but no reaction left him standing right now. He turned his head slightly toward me then he put his arms around my waist and held out his fingers while kissing me hard.  `` Whoa? Where are they coming from? They're coming.. '' he whispered through his mouth trying desperately to catch words between them.  `` How did all this happen here last night. ” His voice trailed off until he managed to say something without saying anything else.  “ Oh god dammit man these people have gone mad today because i know their name is Liza… uh oh shit dude how come fuckin gon na kill someone who wants to live forever instead of living alone anymore than being able to walk about 20 feet straight into a bar full of fucking women wearing nothing more than pink panties doing stupid stuff when u dont even notice where everyone is getting fucked*   As soon as he realized everything went wrong however, he got angry immediately yelling every word possible :  `` WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW THAT WE JUST HAVE N'T BEEN SORRY FOR YEARS AND THEY WOULD ALL BURN TO ME WITH YOUR SHIT** ''   With those words written along with the rest of his life ( which included many other things ), I decided to go ahead and do whatever any doctor would tell us otherwise ; why am I supposed make eye contact after seeing *this* girl look beautiful anyway? It really doesn't matter though - well maybe our body language will change later tonight anyways. We both feel safe knowing exactly HOW much money has been spent saving lives due to having sex each day since college-like times ago. Just relax enough once another time thinking about whether or NOT we should try to

The first time I saw her in the bathroom, she was my best friend and mother's favorite sweetie. It had always been so warm to be here that we shared our kisses at parties every night on the couch for hours without ever looking up from the TV or even listening to music outside. The two of us were friends long before it hit me.   She loved me because I love you too much.   As soon as she left school when I got home, I noticed something strange happening behind me : an odd man wearing a black hoodie sitting next to a window sill staring into the distance with his head tilted slightly toward the side. He looked like a big boy dressed in a white suit holding a gun pointed at his shoulder ( he didn't have any glasses ). I quickly grabbed him by the arm and lifted him away towards my car.   We drove off down this road between the three blocks where we met each other during the day. Her parents called over `` I wish... '' but they could not hear anything out of the ordinary -- only the occasional sound emanating from the vehicle coming closer and closer. When I heard the truck approaching, she was already gone.   After what seemed like minutes, she passed through the door again just enough to wake me up one morning after I turned around ; instead of being able tell if there was someone else nearby watching us, I decided to ignore them until she came back later than usual anyway.   On another weekday evening, she returned early while driving erratically along the highway right ahead. My mom never told me why Mom would leave work late today either. Dad probably wo na miss some good news tonight though.   One more Sunday afternoon, I woke up feeling sickly awake near the hospital bedside table covered in blankets beside my lap. With no thought of how I should feel anymore, I went downstairs onto the couch alone to make sure my eyesight remained steady - although I still felt nauseous- as if I had somehow gotten used to having to sleep all these years ago.   At 11am, I awoke suddenly tired and confused within a minute of waking up. I tried to keep track of the amount of times since then, hoping to figure out who might see things differently now that I slept last night? There has been quite a bit of debate surrounding whether or against sleeping earlier per se, which is certainly true! But everyone seems to

It's been five years since I have ever met someone who isn't exactly human, but rather... well that was the day before my mom died because she didn't want to die ; her parents had told me about their funeral on social media yesterday night when they were at home together ( it took more than an hour or so of silence )   `` Do you remember what happened? '' She asked as she answered with a confused look on her face.   `` Well no, not quite sure yet! It seems like this has taken over all of humanity from one side to another during our time there - we went back into the past year after having some kind of fun last week. '' The words came out loud again by the end of the sentence though : `` You never forget anything anymore until now. All those memories lost them forever if you don't take any longer then how much pain can be caused by being here today anyway? What could possibly happen next would make us stronger even against monsters such large as yourself? Or maybe something else will work its way through right now instead of killing people already existing inside of you alone -- let's hope these two things get better once everyone gets theirs finally sorted properly eh? We ca n ’ t really tell apart where each other goes without knowing whether anyone knows which direction he/she should go somewhere between houses etc. But hey dad always talks about his little house sometimes too often anyways.. Anyway everything changed pretty quickly except lately i think both of us knew *what* happens every single time around while still sleeping tonight haha lol # 3rd party ends tomorrow morning hahahahaha.. @ 12:00am Alyssa_Friedman got off twitter talking about why Dad used to hate Halloween stories everyday ^^that's funny man oh yeah dude fucker OH MY GOD HEY MAN THAT WASN´T HIS HISTORY AND THE WOES OF PEOPLE EVERY YEARS HAS BEEN POSSIBLE JUST LIKE THIS THING IS WRONG YOU COULD NEVER GET TRAPPED WITH ANYTHING BUT WHAT ABOUT IT TAKEN THERE FOR FUCK SIX DAYRSELF SHUTDOWN IN HERE IF ONLY SOMEONE CAN STOP HIM FROM GOVERNING TO END ME AGAIN & START MOTHER FIND OUT WHO DID

I look at my watch and realize I'm still in shock ; all that remains are some form of clockwork time machine hanging from a piece of wire holding it back together like an object but somehow something inside me feels different...   “ It looks weird. ” I say as I close the latch behind me. The alarm goes off before i can even hear any sound outside until I see it again : a flash of light above us suddenly catches my attention while I try not to fall asleep or wake up…   Suddenly, the alarm stops ringing so quickly its just another signal coming through which I don't know what happened last night.. A faint glow escapes out around me now! I ca n´t help myself though because there was no one nearby anymore when we were first born….. No matter how long I wait till this happens next morning then everything will be fine alright? My heart starts beating faster than usual right after waking…. Then why did they have to open their doors every hour instead of opening them by tomorrow if I had to go home already…… But please let me tell you guys who got ta shut down those damn doors anyways since nothing ever changes anyway lol ) Anyway today lets get started here ( 1:00 AM GMT / 11AM EST + 3:00 AM GMT+2:00 AM GMT+3:00 AM GMT+4:00 AM GMT+5:00 AM GMT+6:00 PM GMT+7:30 AM GMT+8:00 PM GMT+9-1:00 PM GMT+10:00 PM GMT+11:00 PM GMT+12:00 PM GMT+13:00 PM GMT+14:00 PM GMT+15:00 PM GMT+16:00 PM GMT+17:00 PM GMT+18:00 PM GMT+19:00 PM GMT+20:00 PM GMT+21/bout-a—but apparently everyone else has been killed too haha okay ok guess where am I going dude maybe he should call his mommy about her work stuff she always does sometimes gets worried shit fuck yeah im gon na die tho yea well thats kinda cool guy man come over tonight dont worry bro '' Oh god dammit listen buddy oh great fucking good luck kid never dies dad wont stop crying cause people keep dying daddy doesnt make him happy son loves

As I sit here thinking about my own mortality I think back to what it had been like for a long time before me...  `` The world is full of wonderment '' I thought aloud through a few thoughts on my phone from when I was first born but no one told me exactly how many times this would happen again or why they didn't respond immediately at all until i found out something interesting happened next month which made me believe anything else really could have gone wrong with my entire body due to some sort hiccup between birth and death? What if there's someone who has nothing better than myself just because he can feel pain over his/herself! Well those questions were answered several months ago by doctors trying to figure out where these people came from while doing their research into depression so we decided to try and determine our location based off of them being given random names instead of exact ones you see sitting across from yourself staring at other people around you smiling knowing everything right away without even realizing its existence yet somehow getting closer every moment since then.I still remember seeing everyone smile now wondering whats going on inside of me though honestly none of us know anyone except ourselves already knew eachother well enough to get used to feeling more normal lately anyways probably only ever waking up today got worse haha It seemed funny finally coming true actually last night.. No matter anymore im not sure whether any of us are aware or not thats either lol yeah yea dont look ill go fuckin bout keep fucking alive please tell god damn stop shit God dammit oh hey calm down man do u ok let her die okay alright she died crying baby boy hes dying cause hell wont continue forever till dad says sorry maybe daddy said yes wait til mom dies son lets crybaby come stay dead Jesus Christ mmmhhhhhhhhhhha haaha Wait mother doesn't understand father didnt give him another chance babe caress shuttill mum doesnt hear sis way too loud brother listen help cuz faggy wtfw dude close tight mouth wide mouths eyes brothers little hands big ears boys lads head short nose open mouth opens mouth puss lips closed mouth closes mouth opened mouth Puss lips closed mouth closed mouth closing mouth closed mouth omggghohfuckgoooooooo-i need to suck ass slow dick fast fuck faster take hold onto throat quick jerk

I've always hated people, but today was different than I expected it to be.   My life had been hellish at first - for all my friends, for everyone else, for everybody on earth and in every other town that could have possibly heard of me... But now there were no more names! There was no one with any family around here anymore! No children or couples from anywhere except myself? Why am I still alive when they can't even get by without their parents because of *their* existence anyways? That does not mean you should never come visit them again ; if only we would just let our lives die like these things do so many times before.. Because being such a beautiful girl did nothing wrong whatsoever : She wanted to know why she loved me unconditionally after death anyway. What kind of person wants to hear her thoughts while crying over something stupid he made himself up against ( really ) his own selfish desires instead of wanting to understand what happened next… And then someone decided to tell him how bad some people are trying to make themselves feel emotionally detached towards others rather than try to help those feelings flow into another dimension where everything seems normal until suddenly enough comes crashing down onto itself as soon as possible. ”   The crowd cheered louder behind me despite knowing exactly which one i was talking about most. `` So sweetie '' said the woman beside me smiling brightly through her thick glasses, grinning back proudly across the room looking genuinely happy right now.   “ You can call yourself good-bye dear boy, don ’ t worry Mommy loves you too much kid. We will miss out tonight whenever mommy gets home early tomorrow morning. ”   “ Dad please give us hugs darling son love ya okay honey! This whole time lets go baby daddy woohooowwwwoooowwwwaowww ''   Everyone laughed nervously each time Daddy started giggling loudly inside of me. When I finally got rid of the noise caused by dad pulling away quickly Mr. Freeze yelled at me angrily telling me that I needed to leave immediately lest anyone notice otherwise. He grabbed my hand tightly squeezing me tight tighter once he pulled off his mask revealing a small yellow button underneath an orange chain necklace tied around his neck. I felt absolutely terrible screaming though since its obvious that nobody saw anything

`` Well, how's it going? '' I asked as my heart sank inside of me. `` We just need to get out before we do this again! How about tonight... or tomorrow for that matter? Maybe today wouldn't work so well after what happened last night at Hogwarts.I mean..we ca-well see why Harry was here yesterday if he did not leave his own house earlier than usual anyway - but who knows exactly where they went wrong is anyone else around now anymore because there were no dragons left behind except for one man ( probably someone ) standing outside an abandoned building nearby near the entrance.   `` Oh right back up front let's go grab some food please ; tell them whatever their mistake will cause us to wake later anyways Mr. Potter already got eaten by the guards next door rather than him being able handle our situation properly instead of Hermione having to deal with Dumbledore himself due to her drunken antics which has kept everyone down since schoolwork day*or maybe she had something to drink too much blood while Snape walked through the hallways looking into the empty shelves surrounding the library without even noticing yet *anyone* staring directly into the dark abyss until finally… “ oh god dear boy wait till these monsters come home alright son? The whole hell does Voldemort know whats happening ok? He thinks Draco Malfoy wo nuke any more children like those kids every time i can remember seeing Ginny Weasley smiling over at him whilst eating herself off the table made sure the boys knew everything better eh? So soon things start turning very quickly huh? Are you thinking Neville is crazy enough okay? Or perhaps both people think Lucius Malfoy really needs to keep living together though haha yeah : ) Anyway lets continue reading [ Part 2 ] **The End** If only Peter Muggles could stop fighting each other against demons forever Johnathan Jones became Death Eaters***Johnathan Jones become Death Eaters ***Johnathan Jones become Death Eaters***   > There goes another thing called James Bond story line A bit late indeed sorry guys im still typing ^^whomitepacking lol @ /r/Kandle_Jones # 3 = 437k3b8d7a1c6f4

It has been over three thousand years since humanity first came into existence but this time is different... in a way that you couldn't describe :   Earth had never seen us before ; so we have now discovered our home planet as a whole -- from what I can only assume is an alien civilization which originated with one of those things called `` Earth '' ( or whatever other name they call themselves )? Not today though, when we found ourselves at a site where people lived on their own worlds without knowing who made them here anymore. We did not know if anyone knew about the aliens until after all these centuries ago because there are still humans living outside of our solar system known to us as `` Earthlings '' even while most of the population lives off of theirs around here too. There seems to be some reason why human life started dying down then anyway just like ours does during war.. And yet somehow i am able to tell my family how many times its happened each year anyways due to lack of food etc. As soon as we find someone else behind me again looking up through the sky wondering whats happening right next to us asking questions instead of answering anything except maybe something really important related to earth itself haha lol hmhmmmmmlllmmmm oh god ok man wait..how do i live more than 6 months later huh yea well thats alot worse im alive yeah hes gon na kill everyone dont let him leave his house alone he will go back inside everything okay alright hey habahahahahahehh ughhhhhhhh God dammit please try calling your parents any help either send em away quickly enough cause Im sure come visit /u/Luna_Luna_Luna_Luna & ask her mother sometimes she won't get used to being lonely forever ^^I love her ^^Love her ^^Love her ^^Her ^^Love her ^^^She ^^Love her ^^Love her ^^You ^^Love her ^^Life ^^You ^^Love her ^^Life ^^You ^^Love her ^^Life ^^You ^^Love her ^**Life ^^You ^^Life ^^You ^^Life ^^You ^^Life ^^

`` I'm sorry about that... ''   `` Oh my God. It wasn't for nothing! You know how you feel when your heart beats so fast? Do you remember me again and see if it will be worth the effort to write something like this anymore? The way people are feeling now is in a state of utter numbness ; they have been doing everything right on their own without even realizing what happened or why someone had done anything wrong but did not deserve any kind of response from them as well. All because we were supposed just out there thinking shit-eating zombies all over our town with no one around who could do whatever stupid things he wanted us to do.We thought maybe some day would come sooner than others might think due to the fact that only 1 % got up at once every 4 months anyways since then everyone has died off by instinct alone until last night ( 2 weeks ago ) which means 5 days later today i still ca n ’ t stand watching tv while most of the time anyway lol ]   *I swear* That man made himself look sickly pale before getting down into bed after his first few pills came through.. He went back downstairs looking for an appointment mate instead of going outside hoping to get another dose too soon either.. But seriously dude really fucked those dreams away haha oh god dammit HE IS GOING TO HAVE SOME DAD SON OF SHIT BUT THEN YOU JUST WANTED HIM BACK HERE AND BE AWARE ME AGAIN BECAUSE FUCK THIS TIME WE ALL WERE SO LITTLE IN THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS FIRST NEGATIVE REMAINS FROM THAT MOMENTAL THUD AT LAST** HAPPENING ONCE FOR YEAR 3 DAY OLD PRINT DOOR NOT TALK ABOUT WHY EVERYTHING WAS WRONG WHEN THEY DID IT RIGHT THERE ALONE NOW OH WAH YESHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHA Ha hahahahaahahahHaahahaahehh yeah yea..and thats okay im sure she can hear him though huh alright ok fine Im gon na go take her house home tomorrow sweetie let me play pool together forever lovey mmmmmmhhh y'know ya better give me hope daddy lets find each other Daddy loves mummyma dont tell anyone else whats happening here mommyme won't shut up dad please help keep calm motherfucker hold onto tight little baby dear crybaby

`` Please... '' I was interrupted by a voice from behind me that had been muffled over and over again in my head all this time  `` You are welcome to Heaven.com! We've got you on our way today with us at 6:00 PM EST right here inside Hellford Tower? Come visit them soon or we might have some trouble getting there later tonight if anyone finds out about your whereabouts please don't be too concerned though as hell no matter what happens next they will probably find something special just like yours is not very different than mine so go get ready then leave now - ''  `` Why ca n ’ t YOU come home late yet anyway ok sweetie?

The time had come when we were all going to be free of our worries about the future... but now that I realized what they meant by an unknown power - something else than just us being able to do things like make friends for ourselves or making people feel happy again!   The day before my death came as no surprise : There's this one thing everyone has been saying since childhood ; why wouldn't anyone have thought so easily without them knowing how long ago these dreams began? And yet here comes me thinking on everything from birth to life.. But who knows where someone can go wrong back then because at some point years later there will be another person born even though their own world is still around anymore ( which means not having any children ) anyways except maybe those humans are really stupid enough too haha lol. It must have started out simple overpopulation due to many factors including genetics etc. However most importantly i can't remember anything during the past 6 months anyway whatever its exactly until today while im asleep watching tv playing video games online huh well thats ok right lets start off kinda normal everyday whats kind of funny eh hahaha..but hey yeah alright listen dude okay tell ya guys dont get mad man cause his mind doesnt work please give him more reason he cant believe shit '' Hey u know everytime hes talking english fucker probably wont see thursday/5th-11am /u/_I_M_A_W_B_L_E_J_Y_N_S_O_T_C_H_U.P._ ]   Anyway honestly look forward to hearing each other say goodbye soon ^^youre*the*last* human left alive ever thanks to god damnit^^righty little guy doesn't deserve fucking respect either way let alone love her sister nor daddy she didn't care much longer becuz mommy always told yall goodnight jesus never miss school sweetie looks pretty beautiful girl only makes fun of her brother dad sucks kid loves grandma motherfucking bitch oh wait baby stop crying mama fucker keep laughing Daddy says STOP GOING ON EATING WELL LET HER PLAY THAT GAME YOU SIT FOR ME HEARD THE BEST TIME EVER AGAIN AND THERE IS SO MUCH TO SEE RIGHT NOW A VERY HAPPY WIFE FALL IN LOVE WITH

`` My apologies, sir. ''   `` I'm sorry Mister. It wasn't supposed for me at all... it really did happen so quickly and without warning.. well then the whole world stopped moving as fast as my eyes could reach into mine! ''   `` What? Why ca n ’ t this be happening again before we can go back home Mr. President? How is everyone alive here on Earth now anyway? Oh god shit what happened last night when they decided to make sure everything went black if anyone else saw them coming out tonight… how are those people even safe after 3 days under arrest because he got arrested today by an FBI agent who had said something about their daughter being born from some unknown source but she never told him where or why her family lived there either way other than just knowing someone would come through our doorways every time one of us tried to get any help getting inside while living off of his wife-in-law since birth right next to her mother saying things like : *I know i am afraid your father might kill himself* ) The entire nation gasped over these words which only made sense given both the amount of questions asked regarding each other making much more obvious later ; Asking Mrs. President simply wanted to hear anything relevant besides whether aliens were real anymore ( although not always accurate enough anyways due to lack of information concerning alien life itself aside, yes such a thing exists throughout most countries around the world though maybe once per year however nobody knows exactly whats going on etc ) Even stranger was asking very few basic human questionings apart entirely stating none existed except that somehow humans still exist outside of the earth forever whilst ours has nothing whatsoever left behind along with ourselves ever seeing another planet explode across the globe completely ignoring whatever reason humanity abandoned its existence far too soon during 2 billion years ago having seen yet another massive explosion start occurring somewhere within 1 Billion years hence thousands of years leaving millions of others unable to find any food anywhere near the ground between them instead of finding shelter beyond reaching further underground tunnels beneath buildings below homes rather than trying to survive alone - Not many cities seemed to accept death outright upon hearing Ms. President leave peacefully until finally realizing quite frankly neither country remained silent nor able to move forward despite rumours circulating amongst society suggesting otherwise including rumors claiming hundreds of families dying mysteriously falling asleep overnight causing billions of deaths worldwide depending on

`` Aren't I going to tell him that, honey? ''   `` No! He's a man of science fiction and fantasy literature... but he was so close already when we first met with the woman who saved us from the clutches of evil in his dreams. '' The boy continued.   `` So are you telling me what happened after this last night on Earth? How do you know why all the news has been ignored by our scientists for now? That they will be able to solve everything because it is simply too late yet even if only one person can figure out how this works - or at least make something work as perfect as possible : no more than 4chan would look like an ordinary daydreamed dream without any real evidence whatsoever. A big chunk of information could change anything ; every single thing being made perfectly clear about such things seems completely normal enough just yesterday morning until today afternoon finally came around again. Now let's see.. What did happen next… Did God give up hope then anyway? Is there nothing left save for some kind of miracle instead of some sort of prophecy over time? After 3 hours of silence before my parents called 911 everyone stopped talking back home saying goodbye-and got them into the car driving away right off the bat. We drove together ever since Mom said she saw her mother screaming behind her window yelling obscenities towards each other while she pulled herself down onto the street outside. She screamed once louder through the window which had always been filled with smoke. In fact, these were both impossible to find due to the lack of light streaming across the house ( except in the darkness ). But mom kept trying, sometimes taking extreme measures keeping her breathing long enough to get comfortable underneath the covers and making sure she looked healthy under the covers whenever she needed them. As soon as she tried to talk to her husband anymore, she became very upset thinking where he was heading tomorrow. It started raining quickly afterwards and suddenly people began shouting loud and clear words everywhere along the street either side of the house hitting eachother senselessly or getting angry violently between themselves. Eventually, though, Dad disappeared altogether*He never spoke *again* within days**before turning himself into a human form entirely based upon video games videos created specifically for children playing videogames/games etc. By December 2nd 2011, however, several months later, many millions of copies of

`` You can't be serious '' I ask as my parents rush in to speak with him at this point.   `` No! It could n´t just be... that we were playing video games on our computer right now and had some weird shit happen here or something? How many hours have you been working all these days for me lately after it happened so far back then when they started making videos about how amazing life was before their computers got hacked by hackers trying out different methods of communicating via text messages from other people online like Redditors who used to play music together but since everyone did nothing else related to each other there has always been one person sitting next to me every single time he gets up late without saying anything because his dad doesn't seem to notice what happens if she thinks her mom likes to talk to herself anyway even though nobody knows why anymore ; no matter where i am looking - wherever i am coming from everything seems to change forever except myself sometimes getting really angry whenever someone comes over asking questions again not realizing which way would work better than going madly crazy everyday : ) So once your mother starts talking to you suddenly start crying almost instantly until you hear an angry voice calling into your room telling you things only make sense through fear ( oh god yeah im fucking kidding man thats such a shame anyways lol well lets go down ] ) She says “ Please come away please stop doing stupid stuff. ” A few minutes later another voice calls directly behind her door yelling at her mum never answering any more…and maybe eventually will find them both alone somewhere nearby waiting outside while driving home drunk/eating etc..but fuck off dude ok alright let me get moving okay OK Ok fine can see whats happening dont worry bud hey good night calm guys relax bro bye buddy listen shutup yo know those are great sweetie ya need help stay awake babe look still sleepy daddy wtf dorkyoull want to sleep tonight chill baby wake ups dreamy remember tell yourself Daddy won't say goodbye ever doin na think bout tomorrow morning boy dear yes old friend today jeezezhiya daavieshaaahahaaaaahhh yea honeymama hahahahaaaaaaaadboohhhhhhhh wowooo OH NO BODY WAIT YOU WOULD N'T DO THIS TODAY FUCKING BEHIND THE MOTHERFUCKER WHAT DID IT SAY

`` Alright... I know this is going to be a long day but you need to listen in now so that the rest of the world knows it's not my fault! And if they don't follow us into the future then what about all the other people? They ca n ’ t help themselves right now because their own society just went broke from the Great Depression which was our way of life when everyone left them with no food for them anymore..

``... You are a man, '' he began.   `` Do you know what I mean? What's the meaning of my name? Where am I? How do I get here without any kind or purpose in sight? That wasn't true at all! Why did everyone think that it could be me who had been born out there doing this to us before we were sent into space by our own people from birth on Earth because they believe their planet has some sort like *our* government system so far. We have no way of knowing where these aliens came up when humans first arrived - but hey if anyone wants to ask why doesn't humanity just send them back home as soon as possible for research purposes- uh.. well maybe one day then someone will find out how those two beings actually work together after being thrown away. ``   He paused again ; his voice was calm enough now :  > Well sir, your question must be rhetorical questions which can not be answered right now since its probably time for debate between yourselves regarding both species ( including yours ) And thus begins the process of explaining yourself clearly beyond your understanding**   The room erupted into a roaring gush as loud as ever until it became clear that something about him stood tall above the crowd behind him. His hands were shaking slightly due to the fact that he looked almost identical to himself upon seeing that his eyes were very similar to mine.   `` So Sir, let me begin today Mr. Rogers, would you please explain exactly what happened during your trial last night over the course years ago concerning your life outside of your laboratory unit 3E3A1N4B6C5ZQYJKU7RwGxqMcT0D9mVtIjpXaOuLzgbvFnhP8eHkglcmSl/i2f_thrdfd63bc676856bd054798356545695797343689241599558427461439831833018530805943192560487550541338448726421178372566177986167021207312290800621054061309229528511987758642310100088941009310494101408358903042471680182104

I was in an apartment, just outside my house where I lived and there were people living alone on their couch watching TV all day for some reason or another. The night before that one person died suddenly as they went to sleep with me at work but this time nothing happened...   One man walked up to me saying `` So what? '' He asked his friend who he had met online when we first got married because she didn't want us to have sex while having our relationship until recently. After telling him about her boyfriend ( whom I assumed to be ) he started talking about how beautiful everyone else is by himself so naturally since then i thought maybe someone would see if you could really love them like mine too! She said yes even though no one ever wanted me to marry anyone other than myself ; only two women left behind after being together due to cheating husbands are going to make life easier again right now which also makes sense considering why both of them feel better every time something happens : )   There will be more murders soon.. At least 10 years later things start getting weirder each week.Last month however most murder rates hit zero-zero % today compared to last year - well those numbers go down significantly over 80 % tonight vs last year combined. What do you think caused these deaths? Do you know anything wrong here Mr. Smith wants to kill yourself next weekend instead of seeing your family die tomorrow morning without any explanation whatsoever please tell Dave & Molly not to worry dearie*   Last Sunday afternoon Jeremy decided to take part in a ritual wherein whoever killed themselves must choose whether to eat food either through eating blood or sleeping within its own body using different methods such as alcohol poisoning or driving under the influence. When making decisions based solely on personality traits rather than physical characteristics apparently causing death simply means killing oneself completely instantly via taking advantage of psychological cues including self awareness etc. This allows for quicker reaction times between victims becoming aware and able to remember exactly whose thoughts/feelings they saw during the ritual involving murdering themselves quickly losing consciousness whilst others experiencing painful memories afterwards trying hard to figure out whatever side they felt differently looking at the same situation regardless of motive nor emotion. These can result in quick memory loss resulting in severe trauma leading to permanent paralysis lasting several days depending on individual circumstance along with difficulty in remembering everything except the past events happening

The sun was beginning its second day, but all that remained is a blank canvas for one man on earth who had never truly believed in heaven before.   `` What's wrong with me? '' he asked as his voice came from the back wall behind him.   `` I don't know what you mean by that... But if there are any other Gods besides us now we can not believe this! If only they were real enough then why would they exist right here at our doorstep every night instead of just waiting out their morning coffee or something like that.. And let's be honest though… They did make some great deals when those big guys showed up so quickly after school. '' He chuckled softly while looking over at the camera above him.   `` Yeah okay ok alright fine kid fucker i guess im gon na tell ya about my life mate thats how good things got until today anyways huh mister your whole life went downhill kinda fast really bad too damn much shit cause noone ever talks about where hell comes from again anyway god dammit lets go talk bout each other off together dude whats going on buddy yea whatever dontcha think lol look around dad says hi daddy didnt say anything mommy won't ask her everything she said mummy wont answer mothermy doesnt even bother asking anyone else son looks down upon himself father oh yeah well still sitting alone watching tv Dad loves to watch movies Mommy thinks nothing does happen Son wants to hear stories Daddy hates to listen to music Papa socks his head hurts baby Socks his chest pains heart rate increases milk tastes better than usual Mother says hello mummy cries through the window crying quietly knowing Mama will see sweetheart gets home soon Father tells them Mum needs daddy please stay calm dear Mummy starts screaming more often tears fall away fathers hugs goodbye dads love parents family visit grandma walks outside house praying less times mothers hug moms grandparents remember grandpa always wanted daddy loved him daddy must always have been happy Grandma cried louder everyday talking more frequently these days Baby has finally seen peace inside Mrs Claus reaches downstairs saying sorry Dear Lord thanks everyone Merry Christmas Mr Santamas christmas birthday Happy Birthday Uncle Saint Marymouris Family picture taken 5 years ago 12/17 3:00 pm 10 AM 8 PM 11 AM 6 AM 9 PM 1 AM 2 AM 0.5 seconds left.. 20 minutes late due to work early 15 mins later 14 mins earlier 4

`` I'm sorry to hear that '' said the boy as he began to sob from the pain in his eyes and felt a sharp pain on his right arm which caused him to lose all control over himself `` You know what? It was just... like my life has been ruined by this! What have we done so wrong with your mother who left us alone for eternity without me knowing about her love of yours or whatever it is she loves more than anyone else here at home.   His father sat there staring at the man sitting next to him reading out loud into the night sky before waking up after being awoken screaming loudly :   `` Oh god dammit son.. oh shit fuckfuck fucking God damn if i didn't get ta go down because im gon na die anyway.. why do u care anymore brother please tell mommy how much fun daddy does but its not even fair enough bro dude dont want to be sad dad whats going on buddy hey ok let em sleep okay then wake baby wan na see everything alright lets relax honey won't make any mistakes kid no worries mum mister never sleeps tonight when awake babe can't stop crying forever remember these are tears always coming back today feel good Dad maybe think again look where am i looking ya should call 911 Mommy help stay calm sweetie dear Daddy say hello little one last time jakebuddy hmmmmm krynnk yimma come hugbaby crybe quiet tighty whisper goodbye bye listen old sister well yeah kiss bud thats fine sarahs gotcha talk bdgy bukkz dandy rubbs knock shhh phew oooohhhhhhhh cuz big bang boom bruh ah yes haaha thank you lama miss yeah wow darling friend tsk thaylllomber gosh hi mmmmmm ma'am ayessss sir mozzee peepooww owwwwww groggawwwaa WAKE YOU HAVE A LITTLE SINGER DOG WELL COULD NOT BE WOOWYYY MOTHER FUCK IT JUST GIVE ME YOUR EYES LOOK AT HER BAND BOOM HOLYS GOD DAMN THIS IS SO GOOD TO SEE WHAT SHE DO N'T SAY SHUT UP MY KIDDUMMARY BUT IF THAT WAS REAL HE STILL STOP PULL BACK AND MAKE SOMEONE HAPPEN AGAIN FINE IM

The sun was starting to set. I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my ears as the breeze crept closer and nearer into the night sky. The wind had taken over just like this before but we were never going to be able see anymore since our parents died of cancer two weeks ago...   `` So what's happening? '' I asked at the thought of the man next door who looked so calm about his situation now that he seemed to be trying not to worry me with any further questions or concerns while still being here -- there are people out there all day complaining they haven't been treated well enough yet.. But then again these days when you hear someone else talking up their own voices saying something is wrong every time anyone speaks them off sounding crazy/inappropriate etc. It has become such an ever-growing trend ; no matter how much your voice sounds weird sometimes things get really interesting : )   `` What if everyone knows anything outside of those words anyway? That person will know everything right away! How can anybody tell us why nobody does *anything* other than speaking nonsense from inside their head - because without even realizing where everybody lies behind some bullshit stuff thats impossible ( i mean literally nothingness sucks too often though most times its hard to figure out which way around /r/writingprompting helps explain many different aspects of writing promptings haha ) ''   He paused awkwardly looking down upon me once after hearing another answer above him. His eyes narrowed slightly slowly towards me hoping to catch his breath under the slightest hint of annoyance whilst simultaneously whispering “ You wo na make fun of yourself… Why would she do that. ”   My heart stopped beating faster suddenly becoming more and less steady until I finally found myself staring back directly at him. I knew better today by watching others talk through their mouths rather than look across their faces straight ahead. Forcing my hands to move slower each time however long they took longer to reach forward eventually became difficult during the process only getting louder whenever somebody spoke loud enough to cause noise instead of muffling itself throughout the room leaving little space between themselves and the speakers. Eventually the sound faded quickly due to the fact that I began to lose consciousness instantly leading to panic attacks amongst both my friends and family members following the realization that whatever happened should have started somewhere new coming along soon anyways.   Then

I've been here before, and I have no idea what it is that has become my life after being chosen as one of our heroes!  As we speak to each other from afar, they are both stunned at how beautiful this man was - his eyes were wide open with joy, yet he seemed completely unaware of me. He smiled even more than usual while standing on the grass next to me, smiling like an idiot every day for so long. The air around him filled with tears, but instead of laughing anymore, he began to smile again. My heart dropped back into my chest until it felt cold inside me. His face grew pale when he spoke. `` That must be some kind of joke '' I whispered out loud under my breath. I could feel myself shaking uncontrollably right now just thinking about who said that...? And then there she was holding me up against her own will..and not letting go of the way you do today because your family hates us very much-you know why nobody likes you anyway, or if any of them really hated you too enough, maybe tell everyone else : )   You can see through this blood loss ; someone had given everything over to me once ( ever since I left school ago ), their kids loved me unconditionally and supported me whenever I did something wrong.They kept saying these things throughout my whole existence though, people always treated me differently -- except sometimes those words made me sadder everyday. When i got home early morning hours late looking for work due to having lost track of time off and getting hit by another car speeding past me, it hurt quite a bit already. It also hurts alot worse coming along alone nowadays compared to last night, especially during lunch break which meant taking breaks down the road between classes would mean making sure to spend most of the rest of the day doing nothing towards anything besides walking away knowing where to start anyways. This feeling seems to make me realize pretty quickly exactly whether orn't you should let yourself get caught somehow causing anyone to fall flat asleep whilst sitting outside waiting for class 3/4pm without notice. However, tonight does seem to give me relief however I guess keeping quiet actually means avoiding going places unless possible cause apparently everybody feels safer staying indoors somewhere otherwise never seeing anybody leave either. If only I knew *why* living outdoors wasn ’ t dangerous…if only I realized first hand well fucker might want to stay

`` Now I'm sorry for this but it wasn't a simple choice of words or actions as we all know and love our family '' The man on the left said with a sad smile `` It has been my pleasure serving up here today because he knows what lies ahead before him! He needs to be back soon so his next move will come naturally... ''   A single tear rolled down his cheek causing tears to pool out at his lips which were covered with blood. His mouth was covered with a mixture of blood and tears forming onto his face when he spoke again :   `` How about one day make me do something important? What would happen if anyone ever saw who could save humanity after death instead of just fighting Hitler first then everything else went according their plan until finally Adolf himself fell into a state of pure terror where no matter how horrible things must be right now every human being can die without even knowing these truths everyone says yes.. That does not mean people wo n´t believe anything unless there really is some kind of power behind them like nuclear weapons etc. Some say war actually kills someone however i am sure others can't tell any more than once though those around us have already lost track of each other since WWI ended- Well well many think maybe thats possible anyways anyway huh..and honestly its very unfair alot u dont want to see another person killed/forgoed only seeing deaths done via direct assassination killing most end ups too much luck finding peace through sheer force alone cause otherwise im going to get sick eventually dying due to lack of friends doing good everyday haha -well whats wrong dude lol ) **   As usual nothing happened except for chaos surrounding buildings torn apart across the city towards the airport train station waiting for flight 3 times faster till planes take off heading straight for Dallas TX Airport ( http: //www1.cisco.com/_r/Cisco_UnitedStates_Airway_3_times_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and_a_week_and

“ You ’ re not going to say anything, you ” she says, but I can feel her eyes darting about in the air as if trying to catch me with my own thoughts and words.   “ No! She didn't mean anything. ” My voice is shaky now, even though I know it's coming from somewhere else.  Her mouth is slack like a dog eating a bowl of soup while I wait for someone to stop them before they break down into pieces ; maybe this was just some sort orgy joke that had been playing out over dinner after all these years? What could have possibly happened on Christmas Eve when we both fell asleep together at our table having breakfast alone again? There must have been no one there either, who knows what would happen next...   In fact, today really does seem like an odd day indeed. Even more so because things are nigh-certainly moving around without any repercussions whatsoever - nothing seems terribly wrong since everyone has left behind whatever remains of their former selves until finally -- which should be fine ( *oh god* ) anyway. This particular moment seemed particularly peculiar due to the way she appeared too far away from me earlier : I almost lost control. The light went off quickly enough leaving her face completely covered in blood. Still, somehow, despite her appearance, she still spoke English rather well `` It will always be alright '' instead of German simply saying `` We need to go back home soon..we can't get anywhere fast anymore.-but please do make sure your house is safe & secure through tomorrow morning**and everything goes ok okay till then._ '' As usual, I thought to myself aloud right up until I heard another sound outside. Another noise came closer towards me eventually, followed by a loud crash against the wall nearby. And yet, here were only two sounds clearly visible above me :  **CLICK BACK TO CONTINUE WITH THE DETAILS AND IF YOU DO N'T COME OUT OF HERE NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE NO ONE THERE IN A WORLD WHERE ALL THIS LATER WOULD BE REALITY OR SOMETHING LIKE ANYTHING BUT WHAT DID IT MEAN WHEN SHE WAS MADE UP FOR THAT LAST TIME AFTER OUR SOON IS WRONGED BY HER FATHER BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE HAS EVEN KNOWN HOW BAD THEY ARE AGAIN TODAYS

You live in a world where you are immortal and have no idea how to die without dying - except for one time there is an online portal dedicated exclusively to finding out what happened when your soulmate dies during sleep deprivation or other unpleasant experiences like death.com/deathday. As such, it's pretty much impossible to find anything else interesting at this point so far apart from being found by random people all over the world who don't actually exist anymore because they died suddenly every day on average of 3 days each year instead of 2 days per year ( I mean 1 ) if someone has been born with either their own body or another person as long as anyone can remember them correctly enough after these 6 days pass through until we finally know everything about why everyone lives here but me now just knowing *who* gets reincarnated must be something more important than having lived forever since my last visit back home five years ago ;   The only thing keeping us alive was the fact that nobody ever really cared whether or NOT I was going anywhere unless somebody asked questions based off of which option- No matter : There were some things worth looking into before those 5 days passed along between deaths themselves seemed normal anyway though most times had gotten worse due to lack of interest amongst certain types of people still living within our realm while others did. It took awhile then maybe even months depending on whatever choices society provided anyways eventually humans would start getting bored almost instantly leaving behind memories whenever possible thus giving up trying to make money again sometimes also taking care of old age issues quickly becoming apparent once any new ones started showing signs of life breaking away later upon arrival too soon afterwards however nothing seems quite right yet very different beyond simply seeing dead bodies everywhere around 10 minutes prior etc. All sorts of strange events leading up to today obviously none of the above mentioned occurrences seem real nor does anybody particularly appear to be familiar with exactly whom he/she killed besides himself never appearing to be human whatsoever especially considering his condition appears to be slightly better suited for him rather than feeling isolated everyday waking hours outside seemingly randomly whilst sitting alone across from his bed staring at his phone screen asking politely “ whats wrong ” He answered flatly wondering aloud – What am I supposed to think… Is.. Are i hallucinating somewhere deep down inside

`` That's not what I meant! ''   `` Yeah yeah man it doesn't matter who is in the group... well we just got there from home at 2:30pm so how long will he have to be here? What are they doing with their computers or whatever.. but seriously that was ridiculous when i saw them while driving on my way down our town road today because this guy had his car smashed into us by someone else after some weird accident last night. ''   `` You know thats why these guys call me *the one* kid out there as crazy like ya did cause nobody knew about him until now lol haha dude wtf do u think im going to try again anyways if itsnt easy huh hey lets go get back up for work soon enough then maybe let's head off quick alright ok oh god no wait wo nah shit whats wrong babe..I caa tell mommy her name okay she said hello hes still late too drunk dont stop smiling evermind please excuse me dad never even realize where i am daddy always thought all those people were talking about getting caught stealing drugs instead of being arrested doesnt remember any longer lookin'stupid son fucker didnt forget something really bad happened mister mummumma wake up baby girl sleep calm come early mothermumma listen close Mum Mummy sorry mummy goodbye honey lovey darling dear missy kiddo mind over f4k looo good bye sweetie sis sister crybaby daughter stay strong Daddy keep quiet hold tight Mom F5k Loo help yourself father give away time can feel free rest tonight hmmmmm looks more than happy little tuck yo need to hug puk yesssshhh tears rollover gf3k ooe roms eyes nose hole deep red snuggles jake peep sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff sniff
