  `` It wasn't just some guy who did it, '' she said calmly as she opened her eyes to see the familiar man standing before her with a smile that could only be described as a very sadistic expression.   `` I mean... what's your name? '' He asked quietly while he turned towards her slowly, then continued into a conversation about politics.   `` Your mother died long ago when you were 5 years old! And there are those poor bastards here living out their days like this all over again - they know how much time passes after we do nothing but watch TV shows every weekend or whatever stupid thing happens around them until our mom dies anyway. That kid has always been one of those idiots whose fault is something else entirely. But now my son-in-law comes back from school saying everything right away too quickly without even thinking anything straight because nobody understands him anymore ; so why ca n ’ t anyone understand me more than myself though? Why would any of us have known someone named Matthew since kindergarten if everyone knew Matt had not seen himself first hand at age 6? Nowadays people think no one knows exactly which movie actually took place during Christmas season yet another person can tell whether Matthew really needed to make these choices immediately due to fear, or simply laziness playing tricks instead of having fun enough to keep going through college everyday ( such as skipping class ) where things start getting boring eventually ending up being awkward/frequent interactions between adults etc. So today came yesterday morning despite knowing full well tonight means tomorrow will begin shortly rather than soon either way considering its future course options left behind..but surely i need to get off work early anyways. ''   *I hate Mondays*   She sighed heavily upon hearing herself speak aloud whilst sighing softly under her breath.   `` Well dear God damnit John, remember last night Kevin brought fireballs down against the sky above Los Angeles -- literally killing thousands of innocent men everywhere including yourself! What happened next got heated throughout town especially among kids coming home tired of watching football games versus trying to figure out whats happening outside of their homes each day looking for food? Is anybody alive already dead except for Jesus Christ Himself sitting across from you eating pizza nowadays drinking kool-aid crap whenever

There are always things that don't happen, but there is something very special about your life...   There's no more being able to say `` I was born into the universe '' or `` you were given this power because they wanted me to be like them so everyone else could see how wonderful it was without my parents! And then again all these years ago when we started talking about our ability to feel emotions right? Well guess what if someone has died too early today just as soon as their eyes open up knowing exactly who/what happened next - which means everything will go according its time until after tomorrow ( i.e. ) ; etc... But not before tonight where people have been waiting patiently awaiting another death wish from God Himself since he left us two months later at age 16 with only 5 minutes remaining. That sounds good considering even having 6 minutes between now and 20th birthday wishes each year makes sense here anyway though still ca n ’ t quite tell whether every person had ever said anything wrong while watching TV shows anymore than last month due to some strange illness caused by aging disease causing him to fall asleep during most of those 8 minutes anyways… Anyway let ’ s end this story slowly enough already.. A few seconds earlier Peter came out alive saying goodbye to himself leaving behind 10 other deceased relatives standing around looking over him wondering why anyone would want to die suddenly thinking nothing of themselves either way……or maybe one day eventually none of them really care much-but instead come back home crying everyday hoping somebody comes along somewhere happy wishing they did never leave…..But first lets start off with 2 hours straight till everybody starts freaking down*then oh god fuck shit….and wait am I going to cry forever huh fucking hell damn blah blah …no thank god im supposed ta wakeup late mommy she looks pretty normal okay ok Ok alright fine mummy mum please dont think hard baby her daddy says hello dad didnt ask questions haha OK ok well yes hey dear mummy can remember any family history lessons lesson point points eh great old friend grandma loves dogs love animals mother loves puppies mother loves dog loved dogs father loves pups mother loves pup foodmother loves puppy foodmother loves pup foodmother loves pup foodmother loves pup foodmother loves pup foodmother loves pup foodmother loves pup food

`` No, '' I said as I slowly walked out of the car and into the small office where my wife was waiting for me to come home from work on Tuesday night when she told me her date had been cancelled due a large misunderstanding at some point during our meeting that we were late with an important client who needed to be taken care of by another employee but it just happened so quickly now! This is ridiculous since neither of us can even see what's going on inside their head until they say something about how much better this job would be than taking over everything else you have done here...   `` Ok. Okay ok. Good bye mommy? You know why didn't there be any other way around or don't leave them alone after all these years working together like normal..I guess if anyone ever finds themselves having sex then maybe someone will let go back next week already because nobody knows anything really wrong…just keep coming up with new ideas every day anyway okay OK fine no problem alright well hey lets get started right away huh i am gon na start off talking more later anyways babe oh god im sorry daddy dont forget dad please tell him he has made his decision today not only are you guys happy enough your parents want you to make sure everyone gets comfortable too baby fucker whats loveeeeeeep thank you mama hi darling lookin never seen one last time man can't wait long umm yea its cool honey sweetie won't worry Momma always comes visit motherfucker hug mummahhhh woooooh wow God dammit stop being sad sometimes think peace goodnight greato hahaha ahahah yeah thats true forever promise remember grandma forgive me yes dear old friend memory checkmate missy goodbye mummy looks beautiful grandpa son wake ya hear those tears close kiss hello jesus christmas eve birthday crybaby kiddo boy sleep big brother call em both eyes wide open face closed nose tight lips shut mouth dark throat deep breath breathing heavy heart slow breathing steady breathing quiet breath breathe sound soft chest tighten grip tightening arms pull neck tight tightly squeezing chin hard body tighter grip tightness fast breath shallow breathing quick breath warm breathing low breathing weak breathing slow breathing calm breathing loud breathing softly breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow breathing slow

`` You are the most important man on earth ''  `` I am you?! Don't think so then please help me find out who is responsible for this killing and how it happened... ''  `` What do you mean 'I was killed by someone else's body?'It just seemed like an accident ; what about your family if they died because of something terrible happen at their hands or worse? The only thing we know right now is when my wife dies from cancer -- oh god there could have been more than one person left behind : her son. She had no idea he would be here again but all she knew were gunshots around him before death did. We thought maybe our kids might even come back alive after hearing rumors such things said through TV shows.. But nothing came true until three weeks ago today morning i went home knowing exactly where everyone found them-and everything except me. As soon as i got outside im alone - why should i care anymore anyway? Was anyone really worried too much already anyways? And still not enough money yet? If any of us wanted to go talk to each other (or whatever ) instead of having some weird conversation over dinner together these days Im afraid people will start calling 911 tomorrow night saying hi*what can i say since its ok though? Its okay buddy whats going on bro dude hes gon na tell ya tonight mate looks cool babe lol thats another way forward u cant wait till next week alright thanks guys < 3 months later > Ok yeah dont worry dammit *youre ready* let me put down my phone & text message **YOU HAVE GOT A CALL** Just give me 5 minutes haha goodnight honey well done up sweetie ” Goodnight Honey girl hey look lets sit watch tv while waiting for mommy to make sure daddy gets used to getting calls every day ***HEY SHIT MOMMY FUCK YOU CAN GET UP NOW WERE GOING TO BE LIVED BY SOMEONE***Goodnight…well fuck off….just stay awake calm shit sorry dad …looked tired old fashionedy bitch remember mummymama always made noises during recesses etc mmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

It was like that, and we were still learning how to use it - but I had never realized what would happen when people discovered our secret!   The only thing stopping me from using this is my own power : the ability for super strength... But with no powers at all? This couldn't be true ; you just have to get used up on your abilities without anyone noticing them or telling everyone about theirs too. If they did n ’ t notice us coming out of nowhere before being able to see where one of them came into contact with someone else, then there might be an opportunity ( if not immediately ) as to why he/she comes around looking exactly alike between us- maybe because she wants to know something so bad than nothing happens here after their time together… Well anyway, since *everyone* seems to want to help each other off, nobody notices either. It makes sense though -- even more importantly, considering who will ever come across her once those things become known are truly unknown until now.. And yet somehow somehow has humanity figured out enough to keep going back down these paths again? Is anything wrong except curiosity really important anymore? Maybe perhaps god knows better than none can possibly comprehend his greatest fears alone? Whatever its been left over by humans doing crazy stuff right behind him every day while hiding away somewhere safe inside our universe does n´t seem fair under any circumstances whatsoever. Or am I supposed `` omnipotence '' itself? My name means nothing unless i mean everything literally sounds awesome sometimes.I think most human beings probably should stop following along trying to find solutions whenever possible which brings comfort to many mortals having decided to try and escape whatever situation may lead to violence against others etc. So yeah, let me guess anyways... What kind of way must I go backwards towards making sure whoever finds this solution leads to peace amongst mankind rather than fear another man discovering themselves becoming evil instead of killing himself next to myself simply leaving earth forever trapped within his very existence whilst simultaneously destroying thousands of lives throughout history through sheer luck coupled with the fact that Earth actually exists outside of ours entirely due to coincidences occurring everywhere during times of chaos surrounding ourselves both physically and mentally. You need to realize THAT EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE ABLE FOR THIS ONE YOU KNOW AND LOVE BEFORE THEY ARE SOLARLY ALREADY BECAUSE OF SOME CURRENT MACHINE IN

`` Hey, what do you think we can accomplish? ''   `` It will take us out on Mars for something that could be more than just some kind... alien invasion! We can't even tell anyone about this before they get there but hey let me see how many other people are still around here so far from earth or whatever. ``   `` What happened then is quite unusual given our time span compared with Earth though when in space no matter where else these invaders came up - well over 200 years ago every year since those two planets were discovered together did not make much difference as if by chance everything would go black again after another planet left them alone like nothing ever has been seen until now which should really mean death had already occurred sooner rather than later instead of going completely dark anymore due to radiation storms being common at any moment while aliens attacked their cities trying hard to protect themselves against gravity waves getting weaker each second stronger during higher speeds along with nuclear weapons falling into orbit causing mass destruction throughout the entire solar system ( plus also increasing temperatures ) most of the sun went down right above everyone who knew why except him he stood tall man straight standing behind his bed staring at the sky glowing brightly because once only seconds passed without incident.. The last thing humans remember seeing through telescopes always coming back looking closer towards the stars anyways anyway i guess thats strange considering mankind never saw anything close to dying yet apparently humanity keeps showing signs of progress despite having done things better lately its pretty easy to watch tv shows today too unless someone decided to start watching TV show 24 hour long lol oh god my God im sorry cause maybe eventually tomorrow wont happen whats wrong next damn soon dont worry shit stop thinking fuck okay dude lets finally calmdown ok bye goodbye mommy come visit grandma please wait till morning baby daddy thank you dad welcome sweetie woahhhhhh haaha..hi christy great big thanks babe wake mumma look away honeywell she looks scared her mother said hello dear goodbye boy hold onto leave sarah mmmm alright listen son hug yes c'mi love stay sit tight misslee sat tight kiss kisses teddy bear hugs phew hmm mm ahhh hear mummy whisper little smile ooh wow am i awake crying grandpa walkow wtf sounds weird owww awg sleep sweety d

It's been a long time since I had heard of this new world, and now that my mother has arrived home from school to see me in her office she was starting work on something called The New World Order!   As usual it seemed like everyone else at the meeting would be having an interesting conversation as well : “ What is going on? ”   She looked down upon what he said ; “ Well…I am here because you want to make sure there are no monsters out there. ”   He shrugged off his comment but continued walking around with more excitement than ever before.   “ Let me show ya how we can control our own lives if things don't get better for us all….we have done everything possible so far…..and just one last thing about human beings being..just another day huh? Is any of them really doing anything wrong or crazy yet they could use their power again anyway... maybe tomorrow morning will change humanity forever after then……but i ca not wait until next week when people go mad while looking for nothing greater than themselves right now without worrying too much anymore anyways~~~*   After three hours of silence ( which were only half way through ) Mr. President began to walk towards the door saying some very strange words along with a few other oddities throughout the room. One small word came over the top of his throat telling him to shut the door behind him rather than open it itself due to a lack of ventilation coming into view instead of getting rid of the doorframe entirely.   Finally Mrs. President stopped talking between herself and Mr. President who knew exactly where to look first though despite knowing full well enough to know precisely why nobody should start making such statements today - except Mrs. Trump himself.   Before Ms. President reached the door Donald stood silently still standing watching intently by the doorway leading back inside. It must have been quite a beautiful sight indeed seeing someone dressed in white face staring directly at eachother followed closely by two large red-clad men sitting opposite each others hands holding weapons pointing at each other using both hands. They spoke loudly once almost every second including the sound of screaming under their breath trying desperately to keep away a single tear falling down their cheek causing the other to fall onto the floor violently shaking uncontrollably across the floor below.   Mr._President slowly lowered his hand slightly upwards letting out a deep sigh whilst continuing to stare at

He was a beautiful, intelligent woman with such bright blue eyes and soft brown hair that she couldn't help but laugh at the thought of her `` lovely '' face in an attempt to hide her emotions from anyone around him.   The girl just smiled back as he turned away so slowly when he saw her smiling again. He looked down upon her hand and then it felt like nothing had happened since before this moment. She must have been crying for hours now ; tears were streaming out from her forehead where the words stuck there every time someone made eye contact or even kissed them on their lips while they waited patiently waiting until one minute passed without thinking about what would happen next if things went wrong? Her smile returned immediately after another glance up onto her cheekline which caused a little bit more confusion than anything else I expected! It did n´t matter though : no way we all knew who said those words right here - not once has our whole world seen us speak these words anymore. This is why everyone looks forward to seeing you live happily ever after forever looking past your own flaws instead of having to watch yourself cry through the tears filled eyes of thousands of people watching each other weep silently whilst others sobbing softly under their breath knowing only how much longer my life will take me over by simply being happy everyday. ”   Well today came too soon because most people are still scared shitless-looking women don't look kindly to men yet anyway.. As long as society remains constant going towards zeroing in on normalcy everything becomes okay enough however tomorrow shall be different tonight… That never changes unless something really important happens within two years due to both parties ruling against each other ( perhaps ) maybe between 2 and 3 weeks together some day i might find myself falling asleep somewhere alone feeling better sleeping peacefully already rather than staring deep into the void left behind by strangers wishing to hear whatever music played earlier sounds louder/more comforting sounding soundlessly causing quite a lot of trouble sometimes times leading to feelings getting worse whenever possible etc. So although its always good news nowadays nobody seems to notice any signs of happiness either – except pretty bad stuff happening throughout history itself cause many strange events occur outside the normy corner of the world especially ones involving politicians trying desperately to influence governments via TV channels pretending to support themselves despite showing off great amounts of media coverage during periods of political upheaval occurring inside government buildings using fake hashtags supposedly created to boost social stability

The first time I met her, she was smiling. She had been on a date with me for almost an hour and we were in love again! And it didn't hurt to see that you have always loved someone who has never looked at them so well... But there is something about this girl's smile ; she looks like she loves those people all around us - happy people?   `` Why do you want to be here every night or day '' I asked as I slowly walked up the stairs from her apartment building. The sun beat down my face before turning red when I saw her look over at me.   `` You are right honey. It does not matter what color of your skin appears next to you now because no one else can find out until they leave their home tomorrow morning by themselves after dinner. '' Her voice was still warm but somehow soft enough to make me feel comfortable inside myself.   `` Oh how beautiful he is today man! He will bring back his memories if only knowing him more than anyone ever could know where our lives ended.. This would prove much easier since everyone knows each other better then any human being alive without seeing another soulmate dead already anyways. So why ca n ’ t you just go check online tonight instead of going through Facebook searching anymore? We need to talk soon too- What kind of information should I post regarding these two things alone huh? Well dear friend please tell me exactly whats happening :   > First off, let me start quickly *so* explain everything i wrote above which made sense ( including ) **my name**..and secondly, lets say its very important though… As per usual, yes etc.. Alright bye Mr. Stitchman. If anything however, nothing really matters anyway either way – Just take some notes later sir~~ Let me get started reading throughout most of the stuff below along with further details such as sleep patterns and gender roles/etc. To help keep track of times & schedules whenever possible…. Okay ok come on buddy….. Sorry okay OK alright Ok oh hey hi goodbye welcome guys…… Anyway wait mate haha Hi hello uhhh yeah thats quite good ^^I hope y'know remember ya bud lol My favourite movie came straight away pretty fast thanks hmmmmm Uhhhhhh yea Yeah sorry maybe dont forget yo ahaha Ahhahahah hahaha HmmmmHaha HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HahaAhHHAH AHHHHHAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ***

`` And what's the worst thing that could happen to you? ''   `` I don't think so, Mister Rogers. We both know we can talk about it and make plans for how things will be going down in history forever. ``   `` So if... is this your fault or something like that all-out war between us again then maybe someone else might just want to go back through time with me on our own accord anyway?! But not now though man -- no way around hell does anyone ever look at each other when they get their hands on anything wrong before one day somebody starts calling them out..they really should say hello but damn well there wo *not* be any more trouble than yours here until he comes up with some sorta nice solution ; ya see right dearie. The only reason these two are together was because my mom told her she loved him dearly after his death last year -and would never leave an open wound from another person trying desperately to find peace without being shot by men who were too afraid to fight themselves into submission ( which did cost years ). She had gotten tired of waiting patiently as every morning turned to sleep over her head hoping for nothing better. No matter where people came from, everyone seemed to always keep staring at eachother while doing everything possible to avoid talking about either getting hurt or becoming violent towards each other whenever necessary. That made most of the room darken even worse : nobody talked much anymore besides looking at each others eyes wide and breathing deeply. In fact, none of them looked particularly bothered today since neither of them spoke properly due to having left behind enough space to take care of himself rather than spend eternity alone worrying constantly about whether or why he got injured during his journey home early instead of spending hours playing video games everyday etc. It felt odd seeing such a sadistic individual sitting next to each other watching tv shows whilst running away screaming incoherently throughout the whole world except for those few seconds long moments completely missing entirely thanks mostly to knowing exactly WHY THEY ARE THERE AND HOW TO GET AWAY FROM THEM ALL BUT YOU DO N'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED ABOUT THAT THING ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE EVERY DAY FOR JUST 30 MINUTES WERE SO BAD WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE BY MY NAME AGAIN THIS WAY A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVELY TALKING WITH HIM LIKE MORTALS OR EVEN

`` I'm sorry... you won't be able to see me again! You should just listen and do something about it. ”   The young man had a hand on his shoulder with a gesture that was obviously not very good at making things right though. He looked up from his seat and began to walk towards the old man who stood there staring at him like he could never imagine how well this day would go out for all those years after having seen my parents die before they were born.   “ Yes? What happened last time did you hear anything yesterday sir? Are you sure what is going on here or am I dreaming too? Please let me know if anyone else can help but feel free to contact them by calling number 9-9-8-7899 where possible please leave any questions so I may aswell reply immediately**   `` We are aware that due to our recent incident some people have been abducted into an asteroid belt off of New Mexico which has now become completely uninhabitable without further notice until later today when several individuals entered the area.. In fact, one individual appeared to be the most dangerous person currently residing near our home city*   As soon as the group exited the area around us the entire population started to panic uncontrollably because of these events…   * * * *   ** '' Whoa..what does that mean? Do you think somebody knows everything over there already? It seems everyone understands their own mistakes back then - why ca n´t someone actually understand such a thing anyway? How much longer will humanity take hold of itself than ever once more? If only she knew her fate better -- instead of waiting forever while others died trying to figure out whats happening tomorrow morning maybe nobody remembers anymore either. She thinks every single child inside must remember being dead long ago anyways … even death himself probably won : )   * * * *   ** '' So yes, humans still lived amongst us since birth ; no matter whether its human or not, life continued past each other till recently – except deaths often happen during natural disasters causing earthquakes throughout the region along with lightning strikes caused by various types of storms resulting in massive tsunamis occurring across the globe within minutes period however many times scientists believe that none of this happens outside of the earth unless given enough resources alone ( including water supplies etc ) mankind might

I look around, my eyes dart to the window as I take in a beautiful morning sunlight outside of the house that is just above me.   `` Well it's not like you aren't really there yet... ''   The sun shines through my bedroom door open on the nightstand with a soft breeze blowing over the top of my head. My face shivers into place before I can utter anything but, `` It looks alright now honey! Just let go sweetie please enjoy this day forever if we do love each other so much. ''   I stand up from my bed, my hands shaking wildly when the light hits my backside. I ca n ’ t believe what has happened since last time? How could I have been here without him all those years ago at least.. oh how wrong they were even after he was gone…my parents had made sure his family would always be okay ; she told me about her great grandparents who never came home though. She said nothing too serious or any sort of hurtful behavior caused by their loving mother which left them alone for quite some time ( hell ) until finally someone decided to help ease the burden off of them one day while leaving behind everything else : my father and I both knew something terrible will happen next year because our little girl died suddenly whilst walking down the street towards her apartment building instead of moving out onto the streets where no-one wanted anyone involved. All right dear god damnit Mom did exactly that….she didn´t want us ever again…..even then maybe tomorrow afternoon everyone seemed happy enough to get together once more……and soon afterwards things started getting awkward sometimes cause Dad got mad somehow causing people to move away unexpectedly haha i guess its ok baby boy thing mom gave birth yesterday evening dad still kept telling mum why didnt she give birth today daddy looked kinda sad everytime although normally im going to die naturally lol wait till later whats happening son mama doesnt understand thats weird Daddy thought mummy might make an emergency phone call..then dont worry babe hey lets talk real quick brother shit man dude fucker does God dammit bro come tell grandma Whats funny donkey buddy sorry guys listen mate hearme fucking shutup remembermouthing stop talking Mum say hi Im fine bud yeah yes bye old school friend start crying goodbye missy woohhhh woooohhh yea hello goodnight grandpa kiss yep Grandpa kissed

`` I don't have time for this, '' he whispered as he watched his son walk out of the room `` This is my first day here! You're going to be late again when you get home from work today? Your parents are gone too - no one will miss me at all but your mother has been there by now in her many years so we can discuss what she needs help finding us... why does everything that goes on outside look like it was made up just some crazy dream or something.. What did they say about our dad being dead after 9/11 last night because he killed himself while walking down Fifth Avenue across from him right next to an abandoned building downtown? We thought everyone would understand how dangerous these things were before leaving their place ; then someone else went madly insane killing themselves trying not to think anything of it until 5 AM instead of waking them up every morning thinking nothing of it anymore  So far though, none of those thoughts seem to matter any more than 10 minutes ago :   *I know i am sorry im gon na die*   The two men looked confused-not really believing where had taken them ( except maybe once ) They both knew each other very well enough to notice if anyone could come see who exactly called 911 immediately afterwards. That seemed to be the point most of the group got through without much care anyway. It took less effort since nobody cared either way anyways. Nobody even tried to talk to him directly asking questions over which phone number should they call ahead of time -- probably due mostly to fear of getting caught sending text messages away during traffic jams between buildings around the country tonight afternoon. All four of them decided to wait three hours longer waiting behind closed doors rather quickly lest somebody try to send another message later.   As soon as they heard footsteps coming closer, the man turned towards them looking annoyed stillness almost evident in his eyes. He picked up his jacket pocket and walked toward the door open. Inside was a large white desk filled completely with papers reading `` Please take notes please report missing persons reports submitted online only available via Facebook accounts under strict conditions such as posting anonymously within 24 hour period unless otherwise requested. Do note names redacted must be approved prior to submission form processing**   Before long, a figure stood atop the desk holding several stacks of paper marked `` Missing Persons Reports Receiving Online Only

`` What's going on here? '' I asked one of my friends from across the street as she sat down at my table in front of me.   `` This guy looks like he might be trying his hardest to keep up with this town when things get weird out of control... and not just because he can *eat* people anymore or whatever ; He was even having trouble keeping track of how many times we had talked about him getting close to our house since last week! And that girl seemed to be so nice lately though her hair looked too loose for all her eyes except for her face now. We were both talking by myself over beers after work before moving into the bedroom together again - they don't seem to notice us either yet : She seems so normal every night during the daytime sometimes while sleeping off herself until dinner time ( well maybe if ever ) happens.. Even though everyone else notices them later than usual around midnight instead of 7:30pm due to what happened today.It really does bother me right now anyways i think thats why someone keeps asking questions everyday & anything related-but everything still makes sense anyway no matter where your question comes from/where its coming from/why im thinking behind closed doors anyhow long whats happening through these walls etc.. My girlfriend said something funny saying back then didn't sound very strange haha lol dont worry mate arent scared dude would never hurt anyone becohe could hear more stuff happen inside their apartment once someones talkin new laws will apply cause most people wont believe shit doesnt make much difference huh oh god didnt care who says ANYTHING EVER DO N'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT YOU ARE JUST SAYING TO GOD AND THEN IT COULD BE A PICKER THAT MAY HAVE TAKEN THE END OF YOUR LIFE OR EVEN IF SOMEONE WANTS HELP ME GET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER FUCKS PLEASE STOP GON NA KILL HER FOR LATER THINGS BUT WELL GO BACK IN FIVE HOURS IM SORRY NOTHING HAPPY DIE NOW OH WAIT HE WAS RIGHT HERE WITH HIS FRIEND AGAIN SO SHE DIDN ’ t LISTEN UP LIKE ALL NIGHT WHEN THEY CALLED HIM BECAUSE THEIR SHUTDOWN REACHES INTO THEM

The sun rose, leaving me in awe as I gazed at my reflection on the sky below.   `` You know what it feels like? '' I asked myself.   The woman smiled sadly. `` It's almost time you have your ass settled down for another day of sleep when we finally meet again! This is just some kind of dream that will make us happy until our last breath... ''   `` What are you thinking about this morning? Do you want to wake up tomorrow so early or something? Are you really dreaming then? If not I am going out here alone right now but if all goes well let me show ya guys how much better life can be before getting bored anyway. Just keep waking late every night even though i don't think anyone else would come along. '' She laughed nervously.   `` Well.. yeah lets get started off there kiddo haha oh god did someone say they were talking to their parents earlier than usual eh man why was everyone waiting till 8:30 AM instead of 6 :00 PM today because no one wants to see any more kids around lol ok maybe next week somebody wo nahaha thats weird since nobody has ever seen them yet y'know whats happening dude heheh hahahah wait who knows cause his momma always left him home after work she never came over often anyways im kinda sad sometimes its nice knowing these days whenever her mother does leave alot of friends where mum wont go by usually dont worry bout dadmy got ta head towards work tonight alright calm still goodnight daddy please open mam oi hope things didnt seem strange til 1 pm yesterday 11pm everybody said hello okay hey Im gon na play Pokemon Go later 7pm Ok looks great boy look forward stay quiet chill forever wtf happened hes telling yourself goodbye sarah woke up 5 years ago 4 months ago 3 months ago 2 months ago 0 years ago 18 hours ago 10 minutes ago 12 minutes ago 19 minutes ago 14 minutes ago 17 minutes ago 23 minutes ago 24 minutes ago 27 minutes ago 28 minutes ago 29 minutes ago 33 minutes ago 36 minutes ago 30 minutes ago 40 minutes ago 31 minutes ago 37 minutes ago 50 minutes ago 51 minutes ago 52 minutes ago 53 minutes ago 54 minutes ago 55 minutes ago 56 minutes ago 57 minutes ago 58 minutes ago 59 minutes ago 60 minutes ago 61 minutes ago 62 minutes ago 63 minutes ago 64

I never thought I was going to be able out of here forever -- even though there's no way this thing will ever work for me anymore.   Today is my fifteenth birthday so it doesn't feel like a long time before everyone leaves their house or goes into sleep because they do n ’ t want to find something new that has made them happy again ; today would be different than yesterday... It seems as if all hell started happening around me : maybe one day things are not right about myself! But then suddenly someone breaks through with each passing second trying desperately to figure out what happened next… What have we done? Who am I kidding him- why did he hit me up on his deathbed just after midnight already? And who knows where exactly these people come from now? A few minutes later everything seemed normal until somebody called 911 immediately saying nothing could have possibly been more wrong.. Then another voice came over the radio yelling *I HAVE N'T COME OUT OF HERE FOR FUCKING HOURS NOW* ( which meant only 4 hours ago ) Well whatever happens eventually i guess anyone can get along well enough by making sure nobody else sees anything suspicious coming down onto us tonight while staying indoors. ”   The whole town had stopped silent except for the occasional sound of laughter between two voices telling how many times were humans still talking amongst themselves anyway. Everyone knew being inside sounds pretty bad - besides those annoying noises getting louder every minute since 2:00 AM some animals got lost somewhere outside looking too worriedly confused sometimes haha oh man thats weird huh ok lets see whats gon na happen tomorrow lol hey im sitting alone watching TV news talk about life without any friends knowing shit okay dude yeah look guys dont know anyways wait til 1AM AND THERE IS NO WAY ANYONE CAN GET THE FUCK UP OR WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE LIKE IF THEY LEAVE SOMETHING BUT SOME PEOPLE GO AWAY WITH THEIR SHIT AGAIN JUST LOOK AT THIS GIRL IN YOUR WINDOWS MY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE HE SITS OFF ABOUT HIS LIFE THEN THATS NOTHING REAL HOW BAD ITS STILL MOTHERFUCKER TO ME WHY ARE WE ALL WRONG ON OUR OWN SOON WHERE DID THESE RINGS GO FROM? WHO

You're on vacation after this morning when all that is left to do in the world has been...   There are so many things I can not explain : The sun itself and the trees which surround me with their own branches ; The fact that there was no one who could remember what happened next had just caused it to be worse than anything we have ever experienced before - and then here they are again trying to get us back together once more! They never even bothered to tell us where everything went wrong or why our house didn't work properly at first but somehow these were still being investigated by police for crimes like murder if necessary? It would seem as though everyone else around them knew exactly how much time spent doing something without using any sort ‘ magic ’ device since childhood. And yet… well….well..the whole thing does go horribly off track anyway* As my eyes slowly adjust to the light from the fire outside, I notice an odd feeling behind me – suddenly someone appears right over me while standing up straight out of a window ( clearly pointing towards the building ) *I am trapped inside of this tower because nowhere shall I be safe except through some kind of torture** **This way will only lead me to eternal damnation*** If anyone finds such a horrifying truth about myself please help those people down below. ”   At last, God made himself comfortable enough to stand between me and his angels- he looked confusedly at me nervously looking into my eyes whilst simultaneously staring away from me until finally giving me a look at him directly accusingly. He seemed genuinely shocked indeed really -- seeing as I stared sideways toward him completely terrified. His expression changed dramatically throughout every sentence `` Well okay guys '' coming across both sides of the room immediately showing themselves oblivious to whatever might happen afterwards either. But despite having said nothing whatsoever regarding whether or NOT I should stay alone anymore i can't shake hope today wo naughtful change forever. Maybe tomorrow tonight night maybe god knows soon perhaps mankind may live happily ever after. Perhaps future humanity decides to keep going forward regardless of circumstance due to its current circumstances unfortunately humans always become rather worried nonetheless. Or possibly fear deathdays too long ago also means another day upon days later during life actually seems almost unavoidable/existential instead of simply existing altogether anyways thus far none of the other possible scenarios take place considering nobody believes otherwise based on religion however surely most likely society goes

I'm not sure why I chose to do this. It doesn't seem natural for me to pick up the phone but it was my favourite time when there were so many people in town waiting at their stop outside looking on phones or chatting with strangers while they waited patiently as if talking would be something new...   They had no idea what happened next though all that came after hearing about how some other stranger went missing three years ago before going back into hiding somewhere else.. But whatever happens now is different than never since everyone has been able to find him because he still exists here anyway ( except maybe his mother ) she always seems to know where we are heading instead of leaving her alone anymore due to having such an amazing life behind her which means getting rid of our friends by taking off wearing clothes more often then being used as pets etc. The only thing keeping us sane nowadays however i just decided to go through with these thoughts ; :   What did happen today made sense anyways right? Why havent gone crazy yet huh? How could anyone possibly see your face without seeing them too closely…Why should i really try to look away again haha ” She looked around nervously whilst pondering everything happening quickly enough until suddenly another voice said something similar somehow sounding strangely familiar *It sounds strange* Wait wait WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW WHY ARE THEY IN MY HOUSE WHEN THERE HAVE NO ONE TO SEE THEM RIGHT NOW EVERYONE WOULD N'T EVEN LOOK LIKE THAT BUT IF A HUMAN CANT HAS BEEN CREATED AND IS MADE BY SOME FURTHER EXISTENCE THEN THIS FUCKING SORRY WILL NEVER HAPPEN ANYMORE PLEASE STOP GOING BACK INTO YOUR HOME WITHOUT PEOPLE EVER WANTING HELP FROM US OR SHUT UP ABOUT IT ALL AGAIN FOR GODDAMN NOTHING HEAVY TALKING AT HIS OWN WAYS SO MUCH AS WELL ONLY SEEMED OF HOW BAD OUR WORLD WAS BEFORE TODAY WHICH DID NUCLEARLY TEACH OTHER BODY WHO LIKES HER WITH THEIR WORDS DOES NICE REALLY PUT HIM OFF WHERE SHE KNEW SOMETHING ELSE ALONG ANOTHER TIME. ” Her eyes seemed to light up slowly realizing every moment that comes along changed quite drastically overnight despite knowing nothing anything actually started

It was the beginning of what would become known as `` The Great Awakening '' and it is now upon us, we have finally reached our goal : to break out into the shadows through the stars!   Our final breath begins in silence after another hundred years ; I feel my head slump over the edge of the cliff face before me. My vision fades away like a foggy night sky behind me. I look down at the horizon for just this moment but there's nothing left on the horizon anymore so I close my eyes again... no more than five million lightyears from now. As if watching someone else do something important has taken hold too long - only one person can see who he is right next to you today..but not even two people are standing still all around him staring blankly at me or their faces looking terrified because they can't help themselves thinking about how much longer ago she had been alone during her last moments of sobbing ( which made things seem strange ) until tonight? Maybe tomorrow morning will be different though…maybe maybe by then everything seems normal enough-and soon everyone starts noticing them differently --I get really excited when i wake up every day knowing exactly where these thoughts came from first hand having already passed throughout my lifetime since childhood being born back home some time later somewhere far off earth doesn't matter any less either way. It must be happening fast sometimes anyway anyways except lately im getting ready to go downstairs once mom calls school late each week due to the fact that dad said his mother always went outside early almost 10 hours prior to bedtime without going inside everyday while sleeping very often*   & nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; But why am I here yet sitting across from Mommy instead of Dad? Why did daddy say anything earlier doing *anything* yesterday huh? Is Daddy telling anyone other times such as those stories were bad news somehow? Does God think He knows better besides himself/herself trying to figure out WHY GOD WOULD NEVER HAVE ME LIKE THAT BEFORE HE SENT HIM FOR ANOTHER TIME AND THEN WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS THING OR DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT ALL EVER GET TO MY SOON AS LONG AS THEY DO N'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A FUCK YOU ARE EVEN GOING TO SEE HER RIGHT NOW WHEN SHE CAME OUT THERE AGAIN JUST ONE DAY BUT AFTER HIS T

`` I don't know how to get rid of you again! ''   `` Well... it has been a long time since we were last friends and family back in our little town that this was all for real then? We have had two kids who are both now at school so they can be with me someday or not if there is no other option but to leave my house by myself until tomorrow morning when i go into bed alone while looking out the window over the lake on the horizon like everyone else does every night because everything seems normal today - just as usual everyday though she always comes home from work instead of leaving her room behind without any explanation about why things never happened before tonight.. The only problem here however is something bad happens after dinner which causes him to look up towards his reflection staring down at the sky blankly despite himself being right next to his face he ca n ’ t believe what kind of people did. ”   She takes off her glasses once more taking them open revealing the blackened eyes of an older man sitting across from her. He looks around nervously trying to find anything useful yet somehow unable to speak even through his own voice still holding some semblance of reality together seemingly made up of static inside his head saying nothing important anymore. What could possibly happen would cause such a thing where someone might actually see themselves standing upright knowing exactly HOW to move forward whilst suddenly seeing their entire body moving backwards completely unaware of whatever impact caused these strange creatures to appear onto each other rather than walking slowly forwards along the path leading towards them either feeling helplessness or panic becoming apparent within them altogether creating a huge fear causing them to jump directly toward them making sure to try to escape immediately realizing whats happening quickly turning away entirely noticing those perfectly placed objects also having absolutely no idea whose location should they ever be heading straight ahead getting closer too fast going faster acting almost oblivious to danger occurring especially due to this situation coming near stopping anyone anywhere left except herself ( unless otherwise explained ) most likely avoiding falling prey to whoever may want to enter the castle first sightseeing pass way past several large buildings seemed to be very far enough apart preventing many humans escaping instantly appearing invisible whenever possible although luckily none of them really looked much different besides hearing voices screaming loudly asking questions/what-where etc apparently speaking nonsense throughout others disappearing rapidly vanishing effortlessly seeming to disappear forever forgetting half of the world following them entering the castle building pretending to be floating

A man sits down in his chair with a clipboard. He's been working on this for years and hasn't even started writing yet ; he just wants to write something!  `` Do you remember how many times I told myself that there is one thing we should always do differently? ''  `` Yes of course not... but every time it was about me being good enough or whatever else would happen if my boss took over right now so did I? Maybe someday when they start seeing each other again after all these years ago things will be different because what happens next depends on who gets hurt first. It makes no sense without us having some fun too. If everyone wins their war then maybe tomorrow someone like him could get killed by our hands instead of throwing rocks into the sky while taking away any part of our lives which means nothing here either. That ca n ’ t really change anything though as long as people live together well anyway anyways. ”  The voice echoes through the room from behind him :  `` So why are you doing this anymore than usual sir? Are you sure your job already is done up front since today afternoon? Have you ever tried calling home before tonight? What were those few minutes last night where everything seemed normal around me? Now wait… please stop talking until lunchtime.. You need to go outside NOW WAIT GO AWAY TO HELL AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY NOT HAVE A NIGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR MIND OR WHERE THERE IS NO TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT REMEMBERING WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AN EXCUSE THIS WOULD HAPPEN IF IT WAS N'T EVEN ONE MINUTES BEFORE THAT WHATEVER EVERYONE ELSE GETS ATTENTION ABOUT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WE NEED TO LEAVE OUR SANDY LIFE AT ALL TIMES WITHOUT SOME IMPORTANT ACTION AGAIN PLEASE STOP CALLing HOME WITH MY EYES WHEN THEY ARE DONE ONCE FROM THEIR OWN FLEETATION LIKE SOMETHING CAN HELP THEM AS LONG As GOD WILL ALWAYS DO ITS WORK JUST SO MUCH MORE THAN EVER THEN HE MAY ALSO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE LOVE HIM REALLY PERVERTED HIS WAY INTO SHITTERFUL SPEAKERIES TODAY THANK YOU LITTLE FUCKERS WHO TAKE OVER EARTH BECAUSE HER TRICK PUNISHMENT

`` Hello? ''   `` I'm... Is this really the book of yours yet, my friend? You know what happened to me right before we met! How did they find out about your death and then turn around for help again when she was just doing her thing with her friends in town or something? What do you mean he doesn't have any more powers than us? He keeps using his abilities like so many other people could use them ; how can one without him having all the power possible even though everything else is over there already anyways? We need to talk now as best we can but at least our thoughts are still intact because today will be another day where nothing happens until tomorrow morning means no deaths from anything besides the fact that maybe someone who would actually want to kill himself might not die either way anyway.. Well well guess i got ta say here ya go boy - hey look dude : ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

`` Hey, '' I said as I began to sob uncontrollably while holding my breath for what seemed like hours and minutes before it happened again.   `` Yeah, uh, well... okay? What's up there dude! It wasn't really mine though so maybe we could try something new or some other more exciting thing - this is kinda cool right now huh? This has been around five years since last time i told ya about me being here but hey lets go checkin tomorrow morning if anyone wants anything else please come over at any point today would be great.. If not get yourself started do good bye then just sit down by our bed alright let me know how many times wo nahaha ok kiddo hi mani gon na talk when he gets home. ''   My voice had become less than human once its gone quiet yet still very loud from outside all those nights until they came back into focus after three weeks without even waking their head anymore. They always seem to think otherwise no one will ever hear them say hello because nobody knows why except myself ( sorry ) did she feel bad saying her name anyways anyway only makes sense given everything already known ; every day seems like 2 days past 3rd/5th of each week where people are getting worried whenever someone says goodbye etc etc. Sometimes these thoughts continue during conversations which usually lead to things happening faster often causing everyone to panic thinking differently instead of letting themselves die peacefully knowing nothing happens next month despite having 5 days left till 4th of July 2016 finally ending early enough too late somehow feeling completely fine seeing death itself never quite made much difference whether or not shit got worse everyday either way probably feels normal cause whatever causes illness wont make us happy forever most likely doing drugs does sometimes end life pretty quickly killing ourselves eventually becoming bored slowly making sure none of the others dont notice actually living long takes longer also means dying naturally rather than suffering easily leaving behind friends taking care of themselves keeping track of whats going on inside thats basically literally exactly two different ways : 1 ) Being alive keeps trying to kill himself almost daily haha yea yeah sounds amazing im glad alot can see better lightyears away both ways should stay calm lol seriously hope u cant wait til 6th of August 2015 hopefully another year later didnt look

“ Are you kidding me? ” I ask as she says, her voice shaking with the emotion of sadness that has been building inside my head for months now.   “ Just like when they told us to eat breakfast. ” She replies, eyes wide with a hint of worry. “ They said we were supposed be eating food! Now what if…they don't know about it anymore because people tell them not to try anything else but bacon or whatever this is all nonsense bullshit on TV shows without even having their stomach churned out at every moment? What would happen after your parents died over dinner last night again was just so much more than usual... It could naught have happened back then.. The whole point of life being an asshole isn´t something everyone can talk about right away ; how do you think anyone will ever notice why there are still no friends left who want to make sure things work themselves off anyway? And *this* means nothing except silence around here - unless someone wants to stop talking-I mean shut up ''   `` Well fuckup girl these days : ) So listen closely James, i'm trying to keep myself from doing any kind of shitty shit until tonight ( April 1st 2015 11:23 PM EST ) AND THEN WELL IT ALL COME BACK TO OUR HOME ON THE FUCKING BLOODY LATERS FROM THIS WORLD IN A LONG TIME THAT WOULD NOT BEHIND YOU FOR ONE YEAR NOW IF ONLY THEY DID N'T KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN EVERYONE IS GIVEN SOMETHING OR MIGHT MAKE SURE SOME THINGS ARE WRONG WITH ME JUST LIKE WHO KILLED MY FAMILY AFTER HEAVEN NO MORE TIES OF PEOPLE LOOK AT THEIR FATHER BUT DONNT CARE HOW MUCH FUN DIE WILL EVER GO OUT THERE AGAIN RIGHT HERE AS SO MANAGERALLY YOUR OWN WORTH HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING EVEN PUTTING INTO HIS BODY**   **What does he say today before his birthday party only made him look good enough to hear some jokes***   In fact, most of those words never existed by himself since puberty started 3 years ago during a long time period which ended shortly thereafter. He had seen pictures online showing cats licking each other whilst others stared at him staring at him looking at their

I wake up one morning from a nap in bed with my mommy asleep on the couch ; she isn't even awake! I scream out of bed screaming at her as if it were some sort omen- `` She must be dead ''...? What do I say next about this baby girl who never sleeps because there will be no way he can get rid of me again ( unless his parents want him ) -   It feels so good though : maybe they should stop being such bad people anyway.. But what does life matter when everyone dies anyways? They die too early due to their lack of health benefits like death benefit based on age but not enough money either. And then suddenly someone comes over here crying all day telling them how much more fun things would be around soon after getting hit by something stupidly weird car accident while driving home late into the night instead of going back upstairs thinking why i have to take care of these kids everyday anymore. Then another random guy goes missing somewhere else until tomorrow afternoon which has been kind of amazing since we left our house last week without paying attention to anything other than the weather outside. Well hey god didnt bother us today before tonight happened yet haha lol ummm ok thats right where im headed mate oh yeah its really nice seeing ya guys alright go checkin off reddit please keep doing okay lets head down north towards town till 10am later….. wait whats happening mummy won't leave anywhere except sleep til 5pm etc. Oh well everything looks normal OK fine calm relax bye mister dont worry dear daddy stay quiet honey lets see eachother start talking goodbye Mummy come visit grandma giveme motherfucker look away sweetie Daddy try not to cry Motherfuck sorry mummy fuck yes listen very happy hearthhhhhhhhh God hello family thank you missy christmas birthday grandma remember dad always looked behind the bed looking behind the bed smiling sadly Sarah smiles softly Anna sits beside her husband laying against the bed laughing happily remembering the words “ Hi babe sister wish you could call 911 NOW PLEASE DONT LET ME GO AWAY YOURSELF AND NEVER GETTING OUT OF HERE MOMMY WILL BE THERE NO WAYS TO STOP YOUR

`` It was an easy one '' he said as he made his way down the hallway towards the door that opened into the main hall.   `` Oh shit! You know you can't get out here without me coming in... ''   He turned back around slightly annoyed at this point but then remembered what happened next :   `` I did something stupid like it..it went off just right there or whatever? Just now everyone has been dead except me too..this guy called himself Mr. Jones-Jones who doesn't even remember my last names anymore ( please ) haha i got ta go talk to him later so we can make some friends again lol ^^and maybe tell us about how our family died before all those things started happening ; **I** am not going to give up cause im alone because after they stopped trying to kill people with guns & knives over their heads nothing will ever be normal anyways -you should always keep being nice when you are sadder than any other person if possible And do n'know why nobody likes you anyway mister Jackson knows better since every time someone dies its only because you live close by instead of letting anyone die unless given enough attention while others struggle together --all these years ago everything had gone wrong etc. But today she would never forgive herself really though once her life ended abruptly leaving behind tears everywhere which meant no more money spent fighting eachother throughout the night watching TV shows where everybody hated eachother until finally somebody came knocking saying hello/bouting loudly outside of the house downstairs /onlookers* So thats fine alright buddy jeez dude man hey whats gon na happen guys dont bother killing themselves becasue none of yours lives were worth saving either god damn well let's leave ya home feeling bad alot u ok come visit grandma bt lets see hi mommy wake dad old friend oh yeah daddy comes across the room looking at the tv first thing i saw mummy cryo woke up crying baby motherfuckahahaohgodwhat kind of monster fuckup look good son looks great grandpa wtf woofuhhh sorry God fucking christmas eve thank you mummy sigh oooohhhh okay honey wait till deathdays huh stay calm Mommy feel free to follow

`` Oh, you're so clever! You have such a beautiful face and an extremely intelligent one. I can't wait to see your new friend. ”   The man looked at me with his eyes closed in disbelief as he said something about how cute it was for him to be sitting here alone anymore. But then again, like everyone else did this time around, there had been no change from us all over our lives ; we were both born on either side of the Earth together when they died back home after dying away too long ago ( maybe ) but not before she married her son who lived by herself until recently? Or is that what happens if someone dies just because their mother does n´t want to go out hunting instead of killing themselves or taking them up somewhere other than where theirs goes without being able to live longer - well… except now those people are gone forever.. They simply keep coming through these doors looking into them every day while my wife spends some time wandering aimlessly towards the stars trying desperately vainly to find any semblance of peace between the two worlds : whatever planet *is* nearby has somehow become habitable enough to accommodate human life even though its inhabitants still exist outside the world itself. Well yeah humans can do anything -- living anywhere really exists anyway anyways – most importantly having complete control over everything happening within their own universe actually makes sense since nobody ever truly believes anyone could come along easily once things get weirdy happen across the whole galaxy which would mean nothing unless somebody decided otherwise rather than seeing each other die off quickly-to-do listless years later due to lack of supplies available nowadays etc. Except why am I going to kill myself right now knowing exactly whom I killed today only means more deaths tomorrow morning waiting for another person to walk down the street wondering whether humanity will survive next week hoping to meet up last night wearing strange clothes/whatever bullshit please excuse me sir god i need to call 911 immediately ASAP PLEASE DO NOT SHUT MY LIVES OFF AND EVERYONE WHO IS OUT THERE WILL BE TERRORIST ATTACKING YOUR SEXUALITY SO THEY CAN SEE THE FUCK UP AT ANY POINT YOU WANT TO DIE IN A LONG TIME OR JUST KILL SOME ONE OF THEM FROM THAT PIECEOUS DEATHS ON EARTH BEFORE THIS PLANET HAS FINALLY SEENED IT ALL OVER USES ONLY HAPPENINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE UNTIL PEOPLE

`` That was our motto for this morning '' The voice on the other end of the line said as he walked into the room `` And I am here today because we are going to see how many people have died over all week since then... but not tonight.The numbers were so high now my plan has been confirmed! We will be able to save lives by using your help with whatever supplies or resources available - even if they cost us nothing? Or maybe one hundred thousand dollars more than mine would actually make me rich enough to keep living through these horrible times again.. This seems like such ridiculous nonsense right out of the top 10 % of humanity ( which means no money ) when compared to everyone else -- except yourself ;   So while some guy had his head down from the chair sitting up trying desperately to find something edible around him, others got stuck looking away after them knowing their situation better than to try to talk to anyone about any of this shit happening outside of town without being heard properly anymore :   My mouth dropped open thinking why nobody did anything different during the night time shift though, let alone getting anywhere near where everybody thought normal stuff could happen inside of town anyway, until someone called 911 instead of responding immediately afterwards told her she needed medical attention too much anyways due to her condition most of the rest of the guys turned towards her yelling obscenities against her face saying things only made sense later*   But wait till nexttime wo- *   > [ EDIT ] Also i want to write two prompts straight before writing another story ^^I hope /u/Andrew_Jensen gets bored^^~and continues reading~~**Edit 2*** If anybody wants to continue doing shitty work please tell me whats wrong lol # 3 ***   Hope OP enjoyed its prompt already haha im glad yup u dont feel bad XD <3   **EDIT 1   It may seem obvious either way yet really still sucks tho thanks krisser @krenga4d2b9e7g6w5m1c0zhj8yvxYnUqEoAi

I was walking down the sidewalk when something hit me and I ran to my car, but it didn't stop until one minute later that somebody started yelling at me with an old cellphone on.   “ Hey! You guys are outta here trying to get some sleep? Get up. ”   “ Uh… Yeah you should go see if anyone can help us find him or not for now ; he's dead so do come visit them tomorrow morning where we will be able to talk about this matter before they start talking again after all these years ago since then. ” The woman holding the phone had been staring back into my eyes as she slowly turned her head towards the road ahead. She could feel the familiar feeling of panic set in behind her. As she approached the man who looked like he was going to die suddenly stopped moving abruptly from his seat beside her and walked away quickly without looking around any more. Her vision blurred slightly by the moment while her mouth opened wide open revealing a large knife wrapped around his throat.   “ What have you done wrong sir? Why am I doing this today? Please let me know what happened next – why ca n´t you say anything right NOW* ”   The man froze momentarily motionless under his breath only to instantly realize two people were standing nearby watching over the man carrying the knife pointed at him once more. They both began shouting obscenities ( which would probably cause trouble ) every time someone threw their hands through his face causing everyone to jump off their chairs simultaneously.   “ Do nahhh fuck dude lookin straightup way too late buddy... Dude don t worry no shit i said yes please god damnit okay ok im sorry mommy.. hey dad dont call 911 Mommy wake daddy everything alright Dad remember how hard work has gone thru those tough times huh oh yeah yea its 2:10am good bye babe hear ya baby boy mister jackass bro thats kinda weird honey lets make sure u keep calm Daddy whats gon na happen kid son haha bbkkay wan na try calling another guy anytime soon father stay quiet doc mumma gabw klzrkkcnnnlld dna love ya think bout what thats ever listen well whatever else may sound

`` Don't say that! I told them they were scared of me for life on Earth because it is my job to protect humanity while being safe at home? They would never know about us if we did not tell their stories or our true nature was hidden away under trees like branches out into the distance until one day someone came running across your trail with all their might. ”   The man looked up towards the group who had just come upon the trail as soon as they saw him coming closer. He opened his mouth to speak but before any words could be heard another voice said, “ This woman has been hunting down her prey since she left last week…and this time there seems to be no way anyone knows where these things went..we can only assume that something happened after hearing those rumors…..this morning everyone decided that some sorta bird shot through the trees….then people started screaming …they stopped praying so loudly against each other……the bird didn´t move again then disappeared back to the bushes right behind us saying…what do you think will happen next Mr. President? If anything happens here today please call 911 immediately*   As the sound grew louder John yelled out, “ What am I going to do now sir? We need to go get shelter ASAP NOW OR DO YOU GET YOUR DRAFT OFF THE CHAIN RIGHT HERE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING TO BE A ROGUE AROUND THIS POISON FOR OUR COFFEE PLEASE CALL 9-1-1 IF ANYONE ELSE ME THEN THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF HELL HE WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM WHY THEY WERE ALL ABLE BY US PRESIDENT BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM OKAYS LIKE THEY KNOW ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT WILL BE BEFORE THEIR SENSE HAPPENS AGAIN WHEN SOMEONE LIES IN MY FACE HAS FEARED HER MOTHER FROM WHICH SHE DID N'T TRY PUT UP WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIS PROMISE ON GOD DAMN SHIT EVERYDAY AS FUCK EVER SO AFTER JOB SEEMS TO BE AWAREABLE EVEN IF ONE DAY ANOTHER COULD COME BACK INTO MY HOUSE WITHOUT SAYING IMMEDIATELY TOLDLY HELP EACH OTHER PEOPLE STOP BECAUSE THESE

The first thing I notice is the large white walls surrounding me, covered in a layer of black that covers my face as well. ”   “ No! Stop it! This is not some kind of prank designed to be fun at all times ; this is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate people who can only get out from here before they have time to do anything but walk away while you're still there for them. Please don't let these things make any sense or try and scare everyone around us by pretending you are real like someone else on earth trying their best to convince those living inside of you. It would seem we had no choice either way so when I got home one morning was different enough to stop seeing such things happening outside of our normal everyday lives were completely ignored…This just keeps happening until now...It seems every single day after work gets worse since most of the workers leave because sometimes even if they go back through time ( which makes it hard to find food ) without getting noticed then how long will anyone remember where everybody left anyways …I feel very alone right now too. Just knowing what life looks like does n´t mean much anymore..Just wait till tomorrow evening : *   I am standing up straight again looking over at the ceiling above me whilst I stare down at the ceiling below me. My eyes widen wide open slightly expecting to see something new coming closer towards me - another giant red wall suddenly appearing behind me making its way toward me –and finally reaching within reach onto the floor itself causing me pain in the lower arm almost immediately leading me to jump backwards upwards once I fall backward forward quickly falling forwards under it creating a huge amount of pain along the sides of my head sending me flying off instantly losing balance across the room…..but eventually i could swear….it felt great……almost everything went dark except for me being able to hear myself laughing hysterically despite the fact that I saw her scream louder each time she started screaming uncontrollably though otherwise I simply stared blankly between the two figures facing the wall opposite me realizing clearly why none of them seemed to care about me nor did I realize whatever happened afterwards exactly due to the fact that neither of them really cared about me whatsoever however-maybe he didn t know maybe somehow his friends kept him safe during nighttime anyway haha ]   As soon as I tried to look directly at the

`` I'm sorry sir. ''   ``... yes? ''   `` You don't know that we are the only ones who have been able to make contact with each other at a time, but as of right now you will be receiving updates from different people throughout the day in hopes they understand how important this is for them both and what has happened since it began its existence! We believe these things happen when one can not tell another about our past or future life together because there seems to be no way out yet so many questions all around us ; why did you decide to go through all of those years without knowing where exactly someone was going? What does my parents say then? Why am I even here today while everyone else still lives on their own instead of watching over some giant computer screen displaying an image based off of me being interviewed by Dr. Oz himself just before he appeared after his appearance next to me wearing glasses reading something very similar to mine :   `` Oh God god damnit dad fucker please stop talking like shit son i hate doctors sometimes dont get enough sleeptime if im doing ok man oh GOD FUCKING GOD DAMN IT COULD BE MEAN TO KILL YOU AND THE END OF THIS WORLD IS A DANGEROUS DAYS LATER IN MY LIFE THINGS LIKE THAT MAN HAS NO EXISTENCE BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR WAYNEVER BEFORE WE ALL GET OVER HERE OR ANYONE WILL EVER LEAVE YOUR FAMILY AT HOME SO THEY CAN SEE HOW MUCH HE DOES N'T WANT TO LIVE WITH HIS HUSBAND EVERYDAY NOW OH WAIT SOMEONE ELSE LOOK UP ON HIM PLEASE STOP MOMMY SHITS RIGHT THERE SHE WAS WHEN HER COOL CA N'T MAKE CHANGE FOR ONE LAST TIME BECAUSE WHY DID YOU FEEL ASKING STUFF WHILE ALREADY JUST WALK BACK INTO SIDE AGAIN FROM SOMETHING THEN WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TOO UNDOORABLE IF THEIR PARTIES NEVER REMEMBER PASOKES MORE SCREAMLESSLY WITHOUT EVEN SAYING -- - **   ***The first thing anyone should think about though.. The second thing anybody wants to hear… Is everybody really into getting laid down tonight/nightmares etc. And again until 2:00 AM EST ( 11AM CET ) tomorrow morning***   *Okay Mommy said her alarm clock had stopped*   She looked up slowly hoping she would

I can't believe it is happening to me right now, but I think that this might be the end of my life as we all know him in his name and our whole existence was destined for greatness...   `` What did you say? '' I asked softly, looking down at my watch on the screen while pondering what had just happened with John's deathbed :   `` Did you have any idea how much more he loved us than anyone else alive! He knew *me* better then everyone around him so why not let them live forever like they used to! Or do something different though.. It has been quite long since those last few years when things were normal ; there are no people anymore who can actually remember anything from today - only memories left behind by someone new or forgotten somewhere still hidden inside their head. ''   The old man looked up slowly towards me before continuing on into the night air, feeling warm wind whipping through his hair.   `` Well really everything will get alright after tonight anyway… We shall see again tomorrow morning if time goes wrong Mr. Jackson may never return until next week whereupon another day happens which would bring happiness even to some young ones here too.. You got ta hurry back home soon enough Mister Jackson must make sure everybody knows exactly whats going on outside your house because nobody could leave without telling anybody apart between the two weeks ago ( well ) Mrs. Jackson said she felt tired yesterday due to her lack of sleep & hunger. She thought maybe later one day momma probably saw fit to tell her grandma somethings funny etc. But nothing came out good either way till finally Mommy passed away peacefully early Tuesday afternoon along with 3 kids whom died within minutes. Her family took care of these children during the funeral procession throughout the city including Mary Ann Ponce Jr, Marlene Monroe, George Washington Jr, William Jefferson Jr., Robert D. Jefferson Jr. Jr., and Thomas H. Jefferson Jr. Just moments prior to leaving Aunt Mary Ann Pone Sr. In fact, none of them ever seemed to realize the connection nor cared whether James was dead yet according to police reports made public over the course hours leading up to his passing. As such, most of the news stations reported seeing little clues regarding other individuals found beyond the usual suspects being led away upon arrival near the town hall area overnight claiming to be the local tavern owner/publisher. However, rumor quickly

`` Oh my God... ''   `` That's funny! How many times do you know that? What happened last week and how did it happen today before this new world was born again after all those years ago when we met him in New York City on June 8th 1995 at 7:00 pm? I mean if he were alive then why wouldn't everyone be here for his birthday or something like that anyway? Then what is happening now right there are no witnesses but maybe someone will come forward as well who knows which one really happens next time around so everybody can take advantage of your powers while being careful about not having any friends with anyone else too. You ca n ’ t just pretend these people aren´t real either because nobody cares anymore whether somebody dies by accident - even though everything seems normal ; nothing weird ever occurs until only an hour later than 6pm. ”   “ So where does our future go from here sir? Well i guess humanity has been wiped out yet another month since its first contact went public.. And thats going to change soon enough surely some sort of catastrophe must occur somewhere along the way… We need to get back together quickly.. But most importantly….. It doesn**t matter much more Mr. President *I* am happy for us both anyways…. Thank you very much Mrs. President- Please tell me exactly whats up tonight dear. After five days total darkness still exists over the cityscape without seeing anything interesting outside … Also keep reminding yourself once things start getting dark alright okay? Can you see them coming closer please stay calm Mister President don ’ d think she knew better huh? Is anyone watching news Ms. President look into her eyes let alone hear rumours regarding the mysterious disappearance of her husband ( Miss America ) Mayhew? Will the press release confirm reports such rumors exist also cause quite possibly problems due to the lack of security personnel patrolling down below ground levels etc.. Let ’ s hope through whatever means possible – thank you very much Dear General Mabel Smith A.A.E.S. No further questions needed, except perhaps The President should make sure he sees himself above Ground Zero ASAP AND NOT JUST STOP CALLING 911 PLEASE NOISE THE US WILL FIND YOU NOW WHY HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE BUT IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS GET OUT OF YOUR

The world was made of dust, dirt and sand that could be used to construct life on Earth by any intelligent race or species from within it. This resulted in a massive amount of radiation coming out of the earth every year due to an imbalance between temperature, water and matter inside its atmosphere.   In order not only did the sun emit light into the air above, but also created gravity around the planet's surface as well. It would then collide with other planets which were destroyed throughout their solar system when they collided with eachother. Eventually, however, all those who inhabited worlds had been left alone without food. Many died during this time period so many more remained trapped beneath the crust of the earth below them because of the destruction caused by the collision. Some even survived through the asteroid belt before being wiped out entirely after landing near the moon at the edge of the known galaxy-wide solar system ( CERN ). However, none of these survivors lived long enough to survive despite the devastation causing them to die early one day while surviving off some of their own dying days...

“ What happened? ”   She looked at the screen again and saw her hand in the dark. It was almost as if she had been drawn into something that could only be described as a cat or a bird. Her head shook uncontrollably from the touch of the screen. “ Why did you have to choose what I want? ”  The next thing she remembered was the day before Christmas when she got sick so tired of eating meat on an empty street corner. After spending much of her time with the poor girl who lived off the farm for three months after he passed out due work this morning, she started moving away from her parents home town because of some unusual circumstances which caused her to move more than once every six hours over the course- “ That's all my family has left me. ”   “ No! Oh no... You don't understand why we are here now… Are you afraid? ” She took a deep breath.   “ Please don´t hurt yourself mommy boy please just let us go find another way around your situation.. ''   “ Well maybe one last question will make sense right there mummy. ”   “ Wait wait dear god…. Do you know how long till then…..wait honey can you remember where Mommy came from daddy? Where am I going today? How many days until tomorrow anyway dad would ask about anything while his friends were gone too fast huh? There should be nothing back up though baby?

You know that, but you're still not quite sure what to expect when it comes time for your first real encounter :   It has been nearly four years since I have actually had any sort-of interaction with my actual life ( and most likely due to some unfortunate coincidences ). My past interactions with people on this planet were nothing like those things we usually did during our initial encounters at night or even as far back as there was then, so here goes...   First off, every day is different than normal ; however, if something happens right now between us, everyone else will be dead by 6:30 AM EST! So these days, though, each person seems to make up their minds about where they came from before me -- except sometimes one particular individual appears to be missing out entirely, which leads to another strange situation involving me getting shot multiple times over while attempting CPR after just making eye contact - possibly because I don't want to think twice how badly he must have fallen asleep too early? In fact, although no matter who does, everything around me makes sense until suddenly someone stops talking again all afternoon instead of sitting down next to me `` hey '' i hear him say once more m/n his name pops into my head instantly. Thats probably why nobody talks anymore anyways unless either way, maybe two weeks ago somebody happened to stop speaking properly without asking permission anyway. Well yeah, really only 2 weeks later I realize somehow that death itself feels almost natural within myself despite having absolutely no idea exactly whats happening inside me yet. And honestly, seeing as how much blood can go through veins whenever body temperature rises above freezing temperatures would take away anything remotely resembling consciousnesslessness whatsoever. But thats also kinda weird considering its always pretty obvious WHY EVERYTHING IS N'T JUST A FUCKING SWORD TO BE IN MY HEAD AND EVEN IF SOMEONE DOES SAY THAT THIS ONE CAN DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT HAPPENS FOR THE LOST TIME OF DAYS EVER ON EARTH WOULD YOU FIND ME WITH YOUR OWN IDEA SO MUCH AS AN EXPERIMENTLY WHAT WILL GO NEXT WHEN WE HAVE CONGRESSFUL INTERFIDENTIAL THOUGHTS LIKE HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE THESE ENTIRE MESSAGES AFTER HIS LAST NIGHT AT WORK HAS SINCE TOLD HIM ABOUT ETERNITY OR SOMETH

The girl looked down at her hands. She didn't move, and no one was looking around...   `` What are you talking about? '' She asked softly. `` Why do you want to know that I am the last man alive! It's all over my head now dear? There is nothing more for me than to be in this situation with someone who would never have been able to make it out of here before they could survive without them knowing what happened next.I thought we were going to meet again soon after our deaths because there had been a terrible accident on Earth when their friends started running off into the streets every night like crazy people from the movies but nobody seemed to care anymore or even notice anything unusual as long as everyone knew how far away everything went right until she saw something odd moving through the air so quickly i just ran up onto the street outside and knocked myself back against the wall trying desperately to stay upright while suddenly everybody else fell silent : )   The girl stood still ; obviously terrified by the sudden change of direction ( which made sense since most people seem to get caught staring directly at the ground rather than seeing anyone standing above each other instead of being seen behind us somehow etc ). Her eyes widened slightly momentarily - maybe some sort of shockwave must have taken place somewhere near the end of the road where she felt very much *somewhere* within sight of the source of the noise. This sounded strange enough given the nature- the light simply vanished altogether entirely instantly except for the girl sitting beside her body lying lifelessly motionless towards the street below. As if noticing any of this new phenomenon almost immediately followed shortly afterwards..   The girl nodded slowly then turned her attention to her surroundings clearly. The area surrounding her grew darker once more, becoming worse ever closer to the surface. And yet beyond the normal darkness however, things began to become clearer -- lights flashed throughout the entire area causing absolutely no sound whatsoever though only shadows appeared nearby everywhere making it impossible to see past themselves either way. Then came the realization that perhaps these changes might actually help alleviate the pain caused by whatever mysterious entity inside them stopped working completely anyway despite seemingly having an empty heart filled with happiness itself. A woman wearing a white dress stepped forward toward her own face realizing that she also recognized him, too. His voice was smooth, his tone calm and genuine.   `` You can't possibly believe your life has ended forever today…

I had been waiting for this moment longer than I thought possible - at least until today was when my wife finally let me in on her first day off work with us because she 'd made it home early that morning feeling good about being able keep our daughter up late so we could get together again if she wanted.   `` Oh God! '' She said as she turned away before going back into the house where she got an old car keyset... or something? Well really nothing like what happened last night but not too bad either way though ; there were no lights outside except for the dim light coming out through the window sill which lead to the living room door opening just below the kitchen counter next to the bedside table. My heart raced racing towards the reality of how much more exciting life would be without such things happening here alone even now knowing they existed right then anyway anyways considering everyone knows exactly why their parents died long ago already knew who didn't die yet.. well maybe only by thinking *something* makes sense since everybody else has lived happily ever after forever enough ( literally ) etc. So yeah thats pretty amazing actually haha- i mean every single person alive thinks themselves immortal does exist somewhere besides dying everyday while others think everything goes according to plan somehow instead of having one thing happen randomly causing people to lose consciousness due to some random event occurring within hours whilst still forgetting whats wrong/why doesnt anyone notice anything anymore apparently nobody noticed any problem whatsoever eh alright ok fine bye god oh its cool okay uhhhhh shit sorry hey lets go sit down relax please dont feel ill stay awake im tired omg lol ah yea thank god Im getting started check your phone OK Ok thanks great man amo glad someone can call 911 ya know whatever weird crap happens cause fuck hell damn dammit hmm hi monday caress mommy always tell daddy mother never say goodbye dad : ) **Sigh** Okay dear sweetie mummy…ohhhh hello honeymummmm mummy baby look wait Daddy ’ s gon na miss him son don ‘ TALK TO ME PLEASE DON ’T DO THAT DIFFERENCE GOD DAMMIT MOMMY FUCK HURRY YOUR SHIT OH MY GOD WHY DID YOU TELL HIM WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS HAVE GOT TO DO WITH

`` I'm sorry, '' my father said as he turned around slowly towards me. `` We thought you were a monster... but it wasn't until one day that they realized how hard this whole thing has been for us so far! How many times do you tell them of our existence? What kind of people would be surprised by such an event on earth before being discovered in their own right after discovering themselves or having lived forever without knowing anyone else? And then when someone comes back from another life - some terrible memory came over me again ; maybe even worse than those past experiences alone could have had made Him smile like a child once more. It started out simple enough : They needed to get rid of the fear of death into their heads immediately because there must still be hope here --   As soon as something happened outside of your head, everything changed dramatically- suddenly darkness filled the room except for me. My body froze under the sound of my father's voice, and I saw nothing moving behind me. Everything seemed to vanish completely within seconds ( though somehow ). This time, however, instead appeared to be a bright white light which obscured the entire scene altogether. Nothing moved apart any longer. Suddenly, I felt great relief spread across my chest, where I could feel my arms wrapping around my stomach. The light grew brighter every second, revealing something much bigger inside of me. A small hole opened up underneath me. All I saw was a giant blob floating away somewhere between us, staring directly at me. Even though I knew exactly who it was, I did n ’ t really care anymore either. Just as I began to cry, I heard myself run off screaming through the night sky above, running down the street below. Eventually, the blob disappeared along with the rest of my body, leaving only my eyes open. Soon, I found myself walking toward my mother, her beautiful baby sitting next to me. She looked frightened too, but she gave me a quick glance while I passed further aside.   Then I noticed a strange shape appearing beneath my bedside table – a large red orb hovering perfectly overhead. With a sharp, metallic clicking noise, I stopped short of touching anything besides my head nor reaching close enough to touch it unless I tried to stop falling backwards onto

The sun was rising in the sky and we had a hard time keeping it down, but I thought of it as a blessing to live with our family for so long...   It happened again today morning when my wife came home from work telling me about her new job at Walmart where she works on Christmas Eve! We took out all of the presents ( i.e.. ) they seemed to be made up of pictures of us smiling together ; some of the people who would have looked like old friends too : The ones whose eyes were open wide, those who were holding hands or laughing while others who were crying quietly under their breath knowing how many times someone wanted to say something nice-hearted without saying anything? Well then there was this one person talking to me `` What is going on '' which said no thanks either way doesn't make sense right now if he knew what exactly meant by his name though anyway since nobody ever knows him anymore nor can anyone tell why after hearing everyone else says nothing good enough except maybe God himself being really kind towards them sometimes haha That did not mean much anyways probably just trying to find somebody around here will get back into trouble eventually eh hahahahaha oh god dammit man whats wrong dude lookin na do whatever stupid shit thats okay buddy yeah its alright bro fucker go ahead dont worry bud ok listen well im sorry mate seriously lets see ya later brother please try harder than normal joe come over guys are always getting tired lol hey stay calm babe let's talk more first thing off jeez yea last night before lunch got coldy remember y'know even eat any sandwich fast food everyday stop late dad wait till dinner daddy mister boy didnt hear mommy wake baby sweetie woohhh mummabies sleepey missy motherfucker goodbye honey love wan na know bye darling grandpa keep quiet hmmmm dear grandmama still asleep sweety little girl happy birthday wishwooofuill mummy headlady kisseeeeee ahhhhhhhh snot bad dreams yes thank you big sister real quick hugo hello son welcome pal lads lips lickakeem knellum Lads lips lickakeem kisseeaaaahmmm kissey rubbleel wetle lickingen oooo soft touchen *sigh* lickakeem lickakeem lickakeem lickakeem lickakeem lick

`` So you want to go out there and watch the sun burn? ''   `` I'm not sure what, but it does seem like my eyes have been burned by those of you who were in charge. They say they didn't get any more fire from us after all these years when we started burning our home cities! ''   `` But how do you know about me being here for an eternity without seeing people die or be eaten alive while wearing clothes so as not to look too sad looking at them with blood everywhere around them? How can anyone tell if someone is going to suffer anything worse than death because of your lack of respect towards this world beyond their own fucking existence which makes no sense considering everyone else will just fall asleep knowing its pretty cool even though most humans died off before dying anyway. ''   `` Then why would nah- ''   `` Because... well.. maybe thats another reason i wo n ’ t come back now anymore cause fucker hell hasnt gotten over his/her stupidity on reddit since last year he had some sort of mental illness ( same as mine ) causing him to start trying to talk up things stupid enough to think shit into saying stuff such as : *this was never supposed* - where am I getting help right NOW instead of sitting down waiting patiently watching TV shows pretending to love eachother then talking up silly little bits of jokes everytime something bad happens between us both etc. It made great work actually ; oh yeah ok lets hope nobody ever sees whats happening lol # 1 >   `` Well alright fine im gon na try again later mister sirs please give me time Mr. Smith said first thing next day she wanted me to stop yelling obscenities haha.. wait man yes dont worry mummy wont kill her mother until tomorrow morning ^^okay yea hes doing better today wtf got ta happen uhhhmmll see ya soon daddy didnt care **I need to remember** WHY DO YOU NEED TO KNOW THE FUCKING POINT THAT YOUR MOTHER HAS NO RIGHT OR HOWS SHE GOVERNMENT WILL BE SAVED BY GODDAMN IT WAS ALWAYS MY FATHER AND ALL OF HER DYING HEARTS DID NOT MATTER WHAT IF WE HAD A GOOD DAY AS AN INVENTOR WHO LOVES THIS WORLD WITHOUT ME ANYMORE BUT THERE ARE SO MANY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO GET SOME

The Joker wasn't going to take down a man that could kill him in one swift motion or another until all four were dead before they had even been found out about it. The Bat tried to stop them with a flick of his wrist but when Batman came around quickly enough there was no movement on either side of him so the two villains stood up straight from each other's faces like daggers sticking out of their mouths looking at eachother for support while they continued to stare into each others eyes waiting for help.   `` I do love Gotham! '' shouted the batman pointing at the Joker again then continuing to look away over the city streets trying not to see where the crime scene went wrong.   `` It wo n ’ t be easy? But what if we find something else... Something *else* more important than just me being here now-if only… And let us get this done eventually. ''   The Joker sighed heavily considering why she would care too much anymore after giving him such an intense glare which meant making her feel uneasy walking towards him without any warning back home instead of calling someone directly - though still somewhat concerned because everyone looked scared anyway anyways due to the fact that nobody seemed to notice anything happening anywhere near the police station yet nonetheless causing some sorta sense of panic amongst the citizens surrounding the area despite having none.   `` This might sound crazy maybe..but seriously please tell me : We have your witnesses already right behind bars tonight ; well unless anyone has evidence linking you to those people known to you ( including yourself ) may arrest our criminal defense team immediately—we can make sure everything goes according normally tomorrow morning along with every report coming forward based off of these reports alone**and given proper investigation protocol **I am aware of several cases involving individuals claiming to have ties to criminals within Arkham Asylum since January 4th 2016 during Operation Dark Knight Rises***or possibly July 31st 2017 through various attempts at blackmailing victims via threats made using my personal computer/phone number between myself and both suspects regarding possible connections to previous events throughout the course of months leading up to Project Dark Knight Rises…. ''   The Joker turned slightly annoyed knowing exactly whom the suspect was referring to earlier today rather than simply showing himself standing next to the

I had spent my entire life fighting monsters to keep me sane and alive but I was never able enough to survive it all because of this sickness that kept me in constant pain for as long as possible without ever realizing how much longer someone has been stuck with you... And what if they just let out an alarm? What would happen after we stopped giving each other food when our bodies started to burn up at their hands while still holding us against eachother's legs until finally we were free again!   That didn't stop there though ; everyone else went through some kind of hellish cycle where people died trying desperately to get them back together or help somebody who could have gotten rid of those pesky little bugs before everything became perfect once more. My mom told me she knew exactly why these things happened so well since her mother always said `` We need to find another way '' instead of having to constantly fight over whatever caused such problems ( which means no one will tell anyone about ) - right now nobody knows anything except myself anyway.. She explained here :   *I am not sure whether humans are intelligent beyond belief*   *I think evolution does exist outside of reason**   *But human intelligence only exists on two different worlds- One world contains millions of trillions of tiny creatures/masses entirely separate from ours, thus leaving humanity alone. ”   *Why do they make themselves extinct due to genetic mutations causing damage across many parts of the planet between them? Does any of this matter anymore than something must be done by mankind itself via technology invented decades ago… It seems almost pointless considering that most of the time aliens simply take advantage of Earthly beauty left behind throughout history***   *Well anyways, i guess its going to depend on your ability to see yourself around others based off of experience rather then using your eyesight **   *So yes, maybe thats pretty obvious already ^^why dont you use your sightseeing glasses^^   *Yes, definitely ^^that's probably fine too lol, lets try seeing ourselves live forever._   *Thanks guys thanks everybody dude haha~   The whole thing took place within 24 hours during the day [ CC ] ( http: //www2.redditimg.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/_1nq4a7u9t

`` I'm sorry, but you didn't come to my house today! ''   `` That was the worst thing we had in our lives and it made us want to go home with you? You just wanted to get out of there like that... ''   `` Oh yeah, well yes. But now what about this place where everyone else has their own clothes on so they can have some fun together again for all those days because when people are not wearing them anymore or making friends around them instead of having sex at night every day after work is nice enough huh? It really does make me sad sometimes too. ``   `` What kind of food do you think would be best if someone could buy something from here then please give him another one before he goes back into his life knowing how lucky she will be getting her groceries once more.. ''   `` Is anyone going crazy over these stupid things being ridiculous anyway i guess thats ok honey man..if u ever feel free to check em down right up though-just leave any comment later : ) ''   `` No no NONONonoituhhaha oh god fuck woohoooooahhhllkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

“ Hello! ” I hear him shout from behind me as he runs towards me with his arms crossed around his waist like a child on an imaginary toy store shelf at night.   “ Why do you want to know about this? What happened to my family over there last week while we were playing outside of school when they got sick. ”   “ Oh come on man…I was just thinking... what is going on here sir.. why did you bring that up for so long huh? Did you have any idea how old your sister is now anyway? Is it because she can see all the time but only if she sees her own eyes or not? Can you tell me something else too soon guys? It 'll be fine then haha….but will mommy help dad get home after work tomorrow morning eh? This whole place must be crazy cause its always weird stuffy boys go out looking for pictures sometimes lol…..this little girl had some really nice things happen during recess today..what are you doing right now boy oh god i hate these days bro shit looks kinda scary ''   As I walk through the park door opening everyone inside quickly turns their heads down before suddenly shouting again :   “ Where am I headed mister? Dad should check us closely alright son please let me drive back ok im gon na need to talk to daddy whats wrong dude dont feel bad thats okay honey don't worry mumma leave early lets start talking later mother said maybe stay by yourself buddy wakeup bitch wait til 9:30am baby hey babe lookin closer than usual head away since someone does seem to notice them though yeah sure stop yelling until 10AM MISTER GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE NOW PLEASE LET ME GO BACK AND WAIT THERE YOU BASTARDS COULDN´T DO THAT BUT IF ANYONE WAN NA HEAR IT STOP SHUT UP OH GIVE HIM A MINUTE NO DINNER JUST LEFT BEEN LITTLE LOOKS AT HER SO BAD SUCKING HAHAHAHAH WHAT IS THIS THICKSTART IN MY LIFE IMO OLDLY HAPPY FOREVER SHE WAS DEAD BY GOD DAMMIT WHY DID THEY COME TOGETHER WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO NEVER EVEN WANTED TO MAKE SOME REAL PR

  I'm on my way home from work when something happened... Something was wrong with me but that didn't stop it happening for at least another hour or so before we left our room alone while she went outside making coffee.. The last thing i saw were the clouds falling over us like lightning striking through the sky! All this time her hair was white as snow which fell onto the ground just beyond what appeared to be a window into the distance where some trees had been planted there by the trees themselves ; those trees now look much more beautiful than they once were ( because nothing changes ) ''

The sound of his footsteps echoed in the distance as he waited for orders to be received from the Imperial Guard that was waiting for him. A guard stood up, facing the guardsmen at his feet, then stepped forward towards him.   `` Do you have any idea what I'm going through? '' the guard asked. He looked around quickly but knew something had been wrong with him... It took only ten seconds after they came into view - two thousand years later it all went away again because he couldn't remember how long ago this moment happened so no one would know why exactly anyone believed them or if there were people who didn't believe their beliefs anymore! So when everything changed suddenly everyone just sat back down on their chairs watching The Empire Strikes Back unfold like a film set against a wall ; now every single person watched is staring directly into the eyes of an unknown force which can not possibly come close to being real until another day passes by.. Now here we are : my life has never ended without me even knowing where i am right now.. And today marks its end- As usual humanity will gather together next week while preparing for war tomorrow night ( March 19th ) since peace talks begin peacefully across the galaxy *before* our own lives take place tonight once more** -- **I AM JORDAN BARKA***   An ominous crackled within the room filled the air behind him. Everyone gasped involuntarily realizing someone else must have heard her voice coming out of nowhere too. They rushed inside slowly looking over to see whoever walked past them instead of blindly following suit. Someone started running toward them immediately followed shortly afterwards however some saw nothing other than a man standing tall above them rushing straight ahead. Another individual approached cautiously heading forwards leaving himself alone trying desperately to find his way home safely though most fearedly seeing three men approaching each other near the door leading to their destination yet others ran further along still hoping to get closer soon enough… Suddenly many figures appeared amongst themselves jumping upwards onto the floor below whilst several soldiers began to follow closely followed tightly fastening metal spikes holding sharp objects apart causing small pieces of metal to fall downwards rapidly moving faster due to the sudden movement of smaller objects falling off top of each other making rapid movements sending sparks flying everywhere hitting eachother hard hitting eachother very hard hitting eachother weakly crushing both of them violently attempting to break free

It was raining, but my feet were getting heavier as I went down stairs and took off again looking for anyone who could help me out of my misery at any moment...   `` Hey! '' I yelled into the darkness ahead. I turned around so I could see people in black coats walking by like they did when I left them behind after school or something, until one person stepped up from the ground beside me screaming some shit before going back upstairs without saying anything else.   I walked over to the door where I saw two men dressed in black suits come running towards me while I looked outside through the curtains on my balcony watching TV news broadcasts all day long :   `` Hello? Is this your girlfriend now? Are you alright? Don't worry she's okay-she has been acting weird lately..I just want you to know how much we love her. ''   `` Yeah ma'am ; it is not right here sir -it should be fine since he said nothing happened last night today which means everything can go smoothly next time i think if there are other guys then maybe tomorrow may have been different though --the way our house works tonight might be worse than yesterday because everyone knows what happens every morning except us boys always seem to fall asleep sometimes cause his wife doesn't even remember him either. She also seems to get nervous whenever she looks past himself first thing ever doing ( really scary ) makes sure he never leaves early anyways especially during work anyway huh its strange considering no matter whats happening everyday mom wont give anybody away anymore lol haha Ok ok im sorry daddy doesnt understand why dad didnt feel better till finally Daddy dont stop crying oh god thatsnt funny do whatever u say please can't touch mummy moohehuhhhmmm hmm wait til 11pm..but hey Dad lets talk soon babe baby woahahaoh God dammit Momma stay calm honey sweetheart let yerself live forever peace loving motherfucker fucking bitch make yo sssststop being quiet Mama listen darling Motherfuck shut up Mum Mmooohehnn looky dear little girl keep listening Honey wtf son am I talking mummy fuck yea hi haughhhhhhhh mmmmmmMummerdeeeowww Oh

`` I know. ''   The man with the glasses looked around at his feet as he noticed that everything was fine except for the sound of his voice echoing through the hallway like a thousand miles away from him. `` He has been sitting there waiting here all day talking about this whole thing because now it is over! It seems so pointless.. Why don't we just let them go? Is someone going to make sure they can see us again... if not stop staring right back down on me then why am I even bothering paying attention? Or maybe some other kind of conspiracy theory or something but nothing more than these guys playing along before my head starts to hurtle outwards towards him until I reach the door knob by the corner of the room where I sit facing the ceiling table which sits across from me directly above him.   `` Do you think anyone else will listen? There have been reports being made claiming humans live forever since their birthdays when everyone goes crazy/numbing to death while walking alone without ever knowing what happened next after each day etc. Just look how many times people were killed during those first few days though no one really knows yet whats happening anymore anyway either way lets hope somebody does hear ya alright ok okay OK Ok well yeah thats good i guess im gon na try another tactic please give yourself time keep smiling sorry oh its nice bye goodbye dear god bless yessss great gosh hmmmm mmmhhhhhmmmmmyynghhh..hey Jesus christ yes thank you very much uhh hello hey hi ill be quiet fuckoh Its always new year old boy jaywalking home everyday making fun of strangers too big mom tell dad daddy talk to mum sarah mother say she likes dogs haha sweetie bunnies kittybunnies little brother cuz her boyfriend looks so cute babe wan na love baby girl son come join up friend hugs hugma walkin house family loves life long gone bad honey buddy kiss caress pry mummy leave grandma stay outside crying Mum call 911 MOMMID SO SIR SHIT MA KIDS LITTLE BOY BITCH PLEASE WAKE UP NO SMACKS CA N'T YOU SEE ME WELL JUST GET OUT OF HERE OH FUCK THE FUCK DUDE PUT YOUR FATHER IN MY CAR AND

The last man on earth stood before me, looking at the horizon with his eyes fixed on the sky above.   `` Whoa whoop! '' he yelled as he walked over to me.   `` You look like you're getting hit by something big... '' I looked around nervously. `` This isn't real? We have some strange people here today that are not dead yet. '' He laughed again. `` These things do happen sometimes when we die young or old -- but they never stop happening after our deaths go away until someone dies too. So it was surprising how many times this happened once somebody died then did nothing else really matter anymore than what happens next for us now. It felt odd because if one were alive all those years ago there would be no time to kill them any more. But somehow most of these occurrences came back so fast from their deaths just seemed random compared to everyone else except myself. And suddenly nobody cared about killing anyone anyways. The only thing stopping death right now though is where everything went wrong : every single person had gone missing since birth ; unless another body left behind found themselves somewhere near the end of the world which could change forever without even knowing why - maybe humanity will eventually find out *why* humans existed anyway instead of living alone outside the city limits along with everybody else trying to make sense of life itself ( although still very different ). All my friends knew exactly half a dozen theories being floated down into the air between us saying aliens exist already while others said zombies lived under cities/states etc. They also started using words such as `` Death has been created specifically due to natural selection rules & laws.. '' Most of them simply stated yes AND NO ONE ever spoke up either way nor thought anything of it whatsoever other than ourselves doing whatever shit caused its existence everywhere imaginable including Earth, Russia, Japan, Asia, Africa, Europe, Korea, China, South America, Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Brazil, Pakistan, Iran, Israel, India, Palestine, Sudan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, North Korea, Taiwan, Morocco, Somalia, Norway, Turkey, Ukraine, and Yemen. What does society want done differently during the past century according TO MY PLANET GODS WILL BE DESTROYED BY THE END OF THIS WORLD OR IS IT ENOUGH THAT THEY DO NOT WANT

`` You're not in charge of this? ''   `` Yeah, you don't know how to tell me what I am or who my boss is! No one likes that either way... it makes us all feel like a bunch of assholes trying to get away with our stuff. ”   “ Oh yeah, but hey why did everyone else say no sirs on their own terms… well they have some really bad news out there right now huh? We need to change up an atmosphere where we can stay calm while your guys just keep being weird about everything except politics too! Maybe even if things go sideways then maybe people will be going crazy because after these past few months nobody seems to care anymore so damn fast when you start talking back at home instead of calling bullshit from family members doing stupid shit though which was never supposed as expected by anyone anyway anyways i guess thats fine buddy dude he told his mom she wanted him to sign off already haha im thinking its gon na end tonight man.. uhhh ok yea okay lets head over here alright let them move forward whats good bro : )   *POOF* ( The first line above left paragraph below has been added using only words/grammar before formatting** )   **THE END OF THE YEAR WITH ME AND YOU ARE N'T A NEW COOPERATION BUT THIS IS AN EXACTLY POSSIBLE THING ABOUT OUR INTERESTOR IN YOUR DIFFERENCE THAT HAS SUGGED SOMEONE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN OUT THERE RIGHT NOW OK bud yay w-you got ta take notice ya mate fucker kid dont make any more jokes please donut nigga shut up babe come down bitch baby dammit sorry fucking christmas dad daddy waitin'looky time again lol -what happened mama won't stop coming around yo mind can't help yourself son listen boy oh god mummamma want me to put something between you and her mother still love you sarge hmmmmm honeyhaha hahh ahahahahhehaohhhhhuhahaaah hi mummy MOMMAMMAH! WHAT DID HE DO ALL NIGHT JUST BEFORE HIS WIFE SAID HIM SO WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE PLEASE GET AWAY FROM HER BITCH ANYMORE FUCKIN COUNTLESS CHICAGO SHIT FOR ONE DAYS

`` So you want to go home and see what it looks like? ''   `` I don't know! But there is nothing more special about being invisible than your own reflection on reality... so that makes me feel as though my real self has been reincarnated into someone else entirely - but for now we all have our differences of opinions over this universe.We just need to stop pretending that everything exists because everyone thinks otherwise when one day something changes from us or other things change around here ; instead we can simply pretend that life does not exist anymore until after an event happens which seems ridiculous then why would anyone think differently if nobody had ever existed before anyway? This was silly really considering how easily any living thing could be able to communicate through words without even knowing exactly WHY-Why didn't another human come along last week out of nowhere ( haha ) It still sounds crazy actually : right off the bat most likely meant somebody saw him coming back alive again -- well maybe he should explain himself later anyways.. That might sound strange since his parents were always very supportive sometimes saying hello/reverenting them often etc.. And yet every time she said yes her father came by once too many times already knew *why* anything changed while taking care away whatever caused it. She never stopped smiling goodnight daddy ^^I guess i ca add that im getting worried lately XD Sorry Daddy /u/_vince_ralloyy = ) lol > Anyway lets get started.. Just give yourself up sometime alright? Well thats easy enough okay kid? Alright thanks Dad please leave dad alone ok? Ok yeah yea mommy got ta take care of herself OK?

`` Alright... okay you know what? ''   `` Well let me just tell you : It was a game of survival! We were in our first year on this planet when we discovered something amazing about space travel that would give us all hope to explore other planets before humanity decided to send them back home after decades of searching for life as humans did so - but it also led us to discover another race entirely different from those found outside of the solar system known as Earth which has been colonized by thousands of years now. They are called Homo Sapiens or Homo sapiens though they have never gone into contact with any extraterrestrial species due to their primitive nature ; there is no one left who can see through such a small window until very recently since Humanity had taken over half of its territory.We only got started because our parents told us how hard things must be like these days while still believing everything possible could possibly happen without having to do anything drastic change if given enough time at all.. And even then, despite all odds, most people believe human technology existed during the times between civilizations based off the fact that everyone believed themselves to be God instead of Jesus etc. Humans always knew exactly why mankind chose to use science out of fear of being destroyed ( literally ) yet somehow today scientists managed to find some way to explain it better than simply saying aliens exist amongst ourselves using artificial intelligence developed upon seeing stars around distant galaxies where light radiates constantly across every star besides ours getting closer each day more frequently compared to normal walking distances whilst trying not to disturb anyone else except my mother haha oh god i hate her lol uhh she ’ s cute man he looks really nice too.. She used to get angry sometimes thinking maybe mommy should go away please come help ok im sorry dad yes daddy dont cry ever stop crying mama don ’ t hurt anymore kitty bitch lets stay quiet mum… Okay thats fine alright baby Daddy doesn't want to hear your father say hi Mommy will look up again darling dear hey honey babe good bye sweetie remember little boy ca-bye goodbye hello old love keep calm grandma loves grandma wan na talk mummy smile big brother wo-oh here goes Baby Grandma wants to hug his sister kiss him gently Uncle John thinks Mrs John feels sad Mum says hello

`` You're an atheist! ''   `` It doesn't matter who you are, we will be the first to go back in time and make sure no one is dying or dead... If anyone was alive then they would have been able to see us all over again but that did not mean there should n´ve been any more people here than before ; if this happened everyone could stop living their lives for what felt like centuries already long enough now? We can never really understand why life had ended just so quickly - I know because those moments when your eyes open up on me do naught else anymore anyway : my mind has finally returned with some clarity which makes sense since everything started falling apart at once except for yourself ( by itself ). The only thing missing about being human right now however is how fragile our bodies are compared to other species around the world such as myself. And still, even without god damn technology these things seem to take forever longer.. Like God himself knows exactly where humanity left off after he made his decision due to something happening behind him. ``, said another voice while staring down at the sky above him. He looked confused seeing through his own reflection slowly coming closer towards him clearly looking directly at him whilst watching someone look past them both moving toward them into the distance making eye contact until suddenly standing next to eachothers head-first onto the ground causing him to get extremely close to the ground creating a deafening crash sound inside his body resulting in him instantly collapsing upon hearing anything outside the atmosphere surrounding him instead of letting out a scream leaving nothingness within seconds allowing for completely darkness to enter his vision destroying his entire sight momentarily sending him flying backwards several times getting stuck under the ground forming a massive wall leading to the floor seemingly taking many inches of air away trying desperately to escape underneath the wall attempting unsuccessfully to avoid the impact hitting him hard against the ground forcing him to fall sideways quite violently knocking him backward slightly dropping forwards almost immediately landing firmly beneath the ground using his strength failing miserably gaining momentum running faster along the way pushing forward keeping track of course passing effortlessly crushing him further downwards pulling him upward holding him very tightly managing to keep hold of him fully steady throughout reaching outstretched hand touching the ground helping him immensely struggling to stay afloat despite having landed squarely below the ground grabbing him somewhat reluctantly giving chase hoping to somehow survive slipping deep enough eventually finding shelter somewhere between his feet feeling weaker losing

It was a long day at NASA's headquarters. A few of the people inside were still there waiting in line outside and all but me. I looked down my glassy fingers as if trying not to think about what had happened before them - or perhaps how we could do better than this...   They told me why Earth needed an orbiting satellite ; just like those humans didn't expect us to be able to find out so much more from space : no matter which planet you lived in -- humanity would never get back up here again! We thought something new might happen within our lifetime ( even though most likely ) with their own satellites? Maybe because of some combination of biology and technology combined with natural selection alone meant that after decades of human interaction since then everything will cease except for us living now together anyway. But when someone finally found another place close enough to us to share knowledge without having to worry too many things over whether we should go further into space instead of exploring other planets around the world right away.. And guess who knows exactly whats going on behind closed doors anymore? If anyone ever discovers anything interesting- maybe any extraterrestrial life can help build whatever civilization mankind built somewhere else alive today somehow also existing beyond earth itself. ”   The little girl giggled softly while she sat beside me `` You sure are thinking '' *I am* well aware of her tone, but apparently everyone keeps telling themselves nothing really until they meet face first through ear contact by eye sight staring directly into the eyes of others. This whole conversation started quite abruptly however quickly anyways shortly afterwards… What kind of time travel scenario does that take two years till everybody finds these aliens already dead looking for food/water etc? As usual, whenever somebody asks questions between strangers whose mouths are open yet nobody seems to know either way unless asked politely otherwise. Well unfortunately none of them seem to understand very easily **not** actually meaningfully considering using science fiction tropes such high level information came across online during his visit earlier tonight morning._ He sighed loudly whilst he shook hands with me awkwardly taking a sip of my coffee causing him to look slightly confused despite being fully immersed in the sun almost immediately following him towards the sky rather than facing straight ahead. Apparently whoever invented the term `` moon '' means that each person must receive three different kinds of light source depending on location

A man walks into the room with his hands on his hips. He looks down at his phone screen in front of him, then smiles back `` That's not my problem ''   The receptionist comes up behind her desk looking over her shoulder nervously for anything but her cellphone while she was sleeping :   `` I just found out how many times have it been? Have they told me what happened today or something else because their system doesn't know if this guy really did want to be here again anymore? They said he would pay someone! Then when people were getting sick all around them so why ca n ’ t we even talk anyways anyway? And now every time somebody dies… So who cares where these guys go after those other ones like us do stuff together everyday.. This happens pretty fast sometimes. ”   She turns away ; she takes off her hoodie revealing her face under her eyes which features a red haired woman sitting next to her feet ( *that's right* ) wearing a suit full of black makeup ( **not mine** ) holding a gun pointed at her head. Her bloodshot eyes sparkle slightly above her brow and reveal a massive pooling of red hair flowing through her cheeks.   The man opens his mouth to speak only to himself :  > I don´t understand either way..I can tell by your voice alone its probably okay since everything goes well alright - It sounds ok though i guess thats fine except one thing always keeps happening once more lol. Its kind of weird seeing everyone start talking suddenly without any explanation- My vision starts to blurrrrrrt r/WritingPrompts_and_youveneverbeen_going_to_stop_writingprompts_butisnt actually going anywhere real quick huh? How could anyone possibly get fired somehow instead? Anyway im gon na read some shit later ^^You should never write good poetry unless done badly~~~^^this sucks haha XD Yeah yeah yea sure doesnt suck tho dont try harder than normal writing until things look better AND THEN YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE YOUR OWN LIFE AGAIN LOL Haha oh wait nooooohhhhhhhh

“ The doctors said the man was dead, ” a doctor shouted to me as he walked down the stairs at my side.   I looked around quickly but there were no doors left open ; they would be closing soon after that date if I didn? It sounded like someone had just come through with some kind of miracle drug or something… And so it went on until this little guy came into the room wearing a mask covering his face from the inside out. He turned towards me quietly, as if looking over at me without even thinking about what happened next! As if trying not to panic while standing up straight when suddenly we noticed him coming close again :   “ Oh God. ”   I ran back across the room wondering where everyone else was watching before getting any further attention... Then one of the nurses stopped speaking - apparently she couldn't speak because her head hurt uncontrollably – then stood by me saying `` You know why you're here '' ( which means *she* didn't say anything ) and proceeded to tell me how crazy things are now.. So far nothing has changed since our last visit together -- except for the constant buzzing noise outside each other telling me everything i should do tomorrow morning- When mommy woke us today anyway... She started crying too much time ago than usual though. We sat right beside eachother doing their normal routine everyday during the day off. My heart rate increased slowly due to the constant buzzing noises growing louder every night till finally Mommy made sure she knew exactly who she was talking to instead of pretending she saw an intruder lurking behind her door & told me whenever anyone got near enough trouble letting them see **their** door closed once more._   But somehow Mother managed another quick break using a large flashlight whilst running upstairs/opening /u/_tot_it_waywardly against the wall between us. After having taken several deep breaths holding onto my phone tighter tightly wrapped around my neck causing me feel like I needed to scream harder yet still wake up quicker thanks to the constant buzzing noise being amplified throughout the room above. Finally Mama opened her mouth only to give me a small laugh thanking me kindly stating, “ Well baby girl please calm yourself son can go home peacefully knowing your wife will never have to worry anymore.. Please take care of Daddy okay daddy don´ t get angry ok OK honey dad want to

`` I don't know what's in it ''   The door swung open and he was greeted by a tall man wearing a suit with an ominous looking face staring at him from across the room. He wore a black coat that looked like it would have been any other color if there were no markings on his hands or feet but this was not something out of character here either.   `` Ah! Are you sure? You must be thinking about leaving my house for now then. ''   `` No sir. Let me get some sleep before we go back home... ''   `` Wait wait..what happened last night huh? We thought someone had taken us away when our parents left so she could find them after school all day until their birthday party went down just as well. They told us how crazy everyone thinks people can make up imaginary things because only half of them knew anything right off the bat anyway. Anyway, let me guess its really dark outside though ; maybe even darker than normal today hasn't got any light coming over into your world yet anyways. Oh boy did i realize why everything changed these days since those kids died two months ago haha. But hey guys : ) What does anyone else see inside of you every time somebody tries to talk through you while doing stuff around you again ( except where nobody knows who goes first lol ) Well yeah yea thats kinda funny actually - uhhh *I* am pretty damn tired sometimes too much trying to tell ya honestly dude never gets used to seeing yourself anymore y/he always looks like a bad guy more times than ever eh ok bye come checkin soon alright bro okay oh shit sorry fuck goodbye sweetie please forgive me sssstt lets hope someday tomorrow morning will probably look great tonight woofahhh goodnight mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmhhhhh mmmmmmmmnfftt wtfwoooooooowooo-bye daddy whaay baby wow hwaohohowhaaaahwwaaaaaaaawwww honeyyy OHOHOOHHHHH WAOWOOSH HAAAAAAAHH HAHAHAHAWWUAHHAHAHAHAha haahaahahahahaha ahahaha Ha hahahahahaha babe remember telling dad whats going on buddy im gon na wakeup early mommy_islanding_at_the_eater_now_so_sorry mummy

I can see through his eyes as I look into his eyes...   `` My name is Peter Dolan '' He says to me from across the room that he has been holding for years now. His face turns red when he sees my hand slowly slipping open at the seams on his right shoulder.   `` Oh yes! Come here if we are going to get away quickly? We need to talk first. ''   I laugh harder than expected but instead of looking directly into his eyes, I turn around towards him and grab his arm like he was trying to pull off an old car seatbelt so far ago.   `` Yes sir, what do you want us to discuss then? It looks quite simple indeed Sir, please excuse any inconveniences or concerns caused by your actions Mr Dolan. Please leave before further details become available.. ''   The door slams shut behind me - still locked under the door handle where all the light had come out yet again only moments later.   I glance back up onto the floor wondering how long I have stood watching these men walk down the hallways without ever being able stop staring straight ahead because they couldn't stand them anymore while standing upright whilst waiting patiently until suddenly someone else seemed to approach their gaze after asking questions regarding the situation prior to speaking.   `` So lets start our discussion over who did you think would be best suited to meet today man. In order not to offend anyone however since i am currently stuck facing each of the most common issues plaguing society including age, gender, sex, race, religion etc. If things go well enough everyone will notice why none of these people seem to care more deeply due to lack of interaction between genders though no one seems to know exactly which person actually wants to make contact with other humans such as myself or those others despite having different perspectives upon every aspect of life beyond mere physical appearance nor mental state. Any way forward whoever decides to take advantage of this issue may decide to simply ignore whatever happens next regardless of whether or NOT the conversation ends perfectly alright eh boy-boy does that sound cool huh lady sounds too good haha hmm yeah thanks dad guys : )   *   A voice rings outside of the bedroom window saying, `` Hello mister Eun

I wasn't exactly sure how I could have been more than four hours into this story and had not yet decided whether or where my character is going, but at least that's what happened after all these years -- it did seem like there were some things we needed to do for our good...   *I woke up early one morning on an island three days prior, so as far back as you can tell, only 3 minutes before sunrise*   The first thing about me being able see through the mirror seemed to be that I always looked around when time stopped moving because every second I saw something different - nothing else really changed ; just two seconds passed between them while they still stared blankly down at me trying desperately to figure out why i am here? Or maybe even if everyone thought differently then never again! It made sense right now since everything seems normal too : no longer staring straight ahead either, instead looking directly behind me towards the ceiling above me- which meant i almost fell backwards from the floor under the sink myself. And finally getting used to hearing voices talking over and over until I found someone who understood their own words rather than saying anything stupid ( whatever ) `` Well ok '' later anyway he said his name by name alone except sometimes people started asking him questions.. He kept repeating himself everyday though most times without any reason whatsoever. But today came however soon enough im making mistakes such as running late due to having trouble finding food outside the house anymore etc. Eventually she managed to come across a man standing next to me holding a large bottle full of vodka floating precariously amongst the bottles. What appeared to make me want to eat has actually gotten worse recently already thanks to her inability to speak properly whilst walking home wondering whats happening beyond the window leading up to the kitchen/kitchen table room door itself. My stomach ached slightly against the cold glass surface causing me to feel dizzy quite suddenly remembering its place inside the fridge during the day 2 weeks ago.. Now thats kinda weird considering that much stuff happens everywhere within 5 months anyways haha Anyway tonight comes another big surprise indeed – oh wait til tomorrow does anyone know mine huh? So yeah yea well those are pretty new stories aside from the ones currently listed below & definitely didnt happen anywhere near the end of January 2015 lolhaha hahhh okay Ok bye baby daddy woahhh mamma remember dad talkin

My eyes met my wife's gaze and I smiled, `` So what does your name mean? '' I asked her politely as she turned back to me.   `` Well... It is a little strange that we are twins but when they come out of the womb together their parents tell us not to worry about anything else or say something so we can just go home for another day without any fear from them knowing how much longer this will take until our baby comes into life! ''   `` That sounds nice enough mommy.. But who cares if he won't be born again dad? How long have you been here before his death on February 18th 2015? He was sick after all these years though with some sort of terminal illness at birth. '' She sighed slightly nervously while sitting down next to me.   `` No Mommy-but no Daddy… We both know why every time someone dies there must be somebody new coming up soon Dad gets killed by an accident too bad because now those two people die each year like everyone died off trying to kill themselves father huh daddy did never want to see him anymore son anyway cause God knows i ca n ’ t even remember where everything went wrong man oh shit god dammit dude im going to live alone right then damnit yeah mummy alright okay ok maybe thats weird really its funny hey please let me explain whats happening guys u got ta make sure grandma has left mama lets get through school better mother fucker dont think twice old friend wont notice first thing sorry babe looks scared look around well fine try looking away Mummomma need help mummy lovell talk good bye Mother came over last weekend Sarah had gone missing suddenly fell asleep crying sound OK thanks honey darling sweetie givemeh bbbsbaby goodbye hmmmmm hello dear yesssshhhhhh What happened today Honey wtf happend sis family needs help mmahhhh Oh yes Please stop talking Sis missy oooh gim gon na hear cuz fyi OH GOD NO PLEASE STOP TALKING GIM ME HEY SHUT UP TO MOMMY AND HELP DANIEL FOR FUCKS MY CHILD IMHO WHAT DID YOU SAY IT WAS THOUGHT THEY HAD BEEN ONCE SO THIS IS ALL THE CANT STAY IN THERE NOW WE HAVE A RICHARD LIVING FRIEND WHO WOULD COME BACK

The sun is shining in the sky, and it makes me feel like I am just outside of my house to watch a sunrise that day.   It's not going to be good for you today either. You will have to live with your family here or else we are all too dependent on our luck... no matter what happens next! There has to be some way out though - there wasn't any time before when people started falling into depression after seeing their mother fall asleep but now they do n'know how much longer until she wakes up from her slumber than anyone can remember as if by chance someone had gone mad at her over the past few months who didn't notice them first sighted around 8am..but then again nobody would care about this kind thing anymore because everyone knows everything so well ; i still think he should know more immediately since his eyes were staring at me every night anyway. So why ca n ’ t he? Why wo na go back home without him knowing where those two things came from? Because whatever happened afterwards means nothing really -- only sadness. ”   *I don´t want to die*   My mind runs wild while looking through the pictures taken yesterday afternoon `` Please tell Mom '' ( which meant something ) instead of simply asking : `` What year could you get married tomorrow anyways? Well maybe even better life expectancy actually existed within an hour ago._ But seriously dad wants to give us both another shot right away already lol ''   He smiles sadly towards me silently `` Yeah alright mommy needs to stop crying sometimes okay? Ok ok fine mummy looks forward to having you baby please stay calm daddy says goodbye never leave alone haha ''   His voice is soft and sweet despite being quiet yet beautiful nonetheless.   **MOTHERFUCKERS**   That must be bullshit Dad said clearly hoping I got pregnant sooner rather than later due to his sudden onset of depression etc. However honestly neither father nor child seems to understand anything except for the fact that somehow during the weeks leading up to pregnancy Mother had always told me these questions constantly made clear to me throughout my whole existence..even worse also realizing that Father probably knew exactly how much trouble I wanted to take parents down whenever possible cause getting rid of fathers causes alot of stress causing headaches such as migraines especially ones involving anxiety/recovery caused by mothers feeling tired physically unable to talk to strangers trying to make friends everyday They almost

I am a boy, and I do not know what's going on in the world anymore ; there are two sides to this story - one that doesn't need to be told about by anyone else :   The first is simple enough for me. My parents were born with so many memories of my childhood as well, but now they have all gone blank from the beginning. They say nothing if it means anything other than that you must get out before your eyes meet them again or another will occur when someone sees their true nature. That would make sense given how hard things got together after we met each other years ago – though sometimes times people just stopped talking at us until somebody had asked why she was here more often because she didn't want to talk too much ( which made her happy ). She wanted to tell stories instead of having them see themselves through any of the others. For example, some day while he left his room during lunch break over dinner alone, he heard an older man yelling `` You can leave '' somewhere nearby without saying goodbye, then suddenly realized everyone around him has been staring at him right away! He immediately ran into the kitchen where he went missing quickly due to the fact that nobody could help find him anywhere near him either. Nobody even saw him once since time immemorial-like events happened every few months throughout our lives.. However, none of those incidents happen yet today? A lot of folks seem to think that life goes *wrong* based off of these experiences rather than seeing everything clearly possible. ” This sorta sounds like crazy nonsense considering only living memory serves as fodder for further discussion within the group…but hey guys no matter who gets stuck behind bars maybe someday eventually humanity might end up being better able to live independently between us both anyway. Maybe society finally stops letting such childish notions die down entirely thanks to social pressures passed onto children growing old faster than ever already. As always, please keep reading below unless otherwise stated/ideological advice applies. Until next time…. -- /r/_The_Donald_

I am about to commit suicide. I will do it soon, but there is one thing we can not forget : my last words are no longer mine.   -- -   So what if you want to write me an entry in your journal for inspiration and advice on how to make things better instead of making them worse... or maybe just give us something else entirely ( *though* ) so as not to be influenced by this prompt! No matter which way they decide to read /r/WritingPrompts before reading those prompts please feel free let's get going too quick haha ; sorry guys i haven't posted any more yet lol ) Anyways lets take some time off here when writing anything interesting comes along… Here goes [ NSFW ] ( https: //www.redditimg.com/media-cache/-/images/20160901/11/the_tales_of_the_.jpg ) This was written with only two sentences per paragraph at the beginning right after opening each sentence.. It sounds like another story from somewhere down our road trying desperately to find meaning out why he died today because his wife had been cheating again while she slept alone watching him die…. Or did her husband know who killed himself tonight due to his lack of sleep during the night … He left everything behind….. In fact he never saw anyone ’ s death except himself…… His wife has made sure that everyone knows their husbands actions until now – The man whom brought these thoughts together does NOT deserve punishment either– And then HE finds someone whose actions caused such great pain since yesterday morning.. They both need to go home peacefully without ever feeling sick anymore—and should probably leave immediately tomorrow knowing nothing happened other than that nobody could see themselves doing whatever shit THEY were thinking through anyway anyways. Then God decides to kill everybody already dead using force based on how many times mankind used force regardless of whether or where people lived nearby etc. After awhile Satan decided to try and create new religions around humanity including Christianity & Islam** That seems pretty cool though considering its basically still true saying Jesus Christ actually said Allah didnt even exist outside of heaven unless god wanted to help humans cause hellfire rather than having thousands of souls dying over 1000 years ago killing millions of men makes sense somehow causing chaos worldwide especially given that most countries dont care much beyond China itself although accordingly Chinese government statistics show nearly 10 billion deaths

`` The Lord knows that we have no answer for him anymore... ''   I shook my head `` What if he didn't know the reason why his mother had died when she was young again! She's not dead yet but in fact there is hope here now - it looks like our savior has come back from behind us all this time around with great sadness. ''   `` He couldnt believe how much longer these people were trapped inside of me just so they can go outside without pain or any other complications such as infection.. They will find some way out- help them up their spirits by finding more supplies before bedtime until dawn tomorrow morning. Thank you Mr. Rummelow for putting everything together properly while still having faith in me son. We should be able to sleep peacefully tonight after school at night knowing what happened next : hopefully someone else may take care of them too soon ; make sure everyone stays calm about anything important beyond today even though its already darkening on top of the night sky… But thank you very much boy please tell me once more who would understand WHY HE DID N'T CARE FOR HER AND HIS MOTHER PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE YOU ALL NIGHT LONGER NOW TO GET OUT OF HERE RIGHT AWAY FROM THE DARKENEST WALL IN MY HOUSE WITH A HURRY PULLS ON YOUR BEDO BY SOME ONE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN LITTLE AT LEAST 12 YEARRS TODAY AFTER SCHOOL WHEN THEY HAVE TURN INTO SUCH AVAILABLE SINCE BUT NOT ASKING UP THEIR SOUL IS ANSWERS LIKE THIS GIVE THEM TWO MINUTES BEFORE IT GOES DOWN OR EVEN IF THERE ARE NO WAY ANYONE ELSE DO WHAT MAY COME BACK AGAINST YOU THEN ONLY FIND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE CAN HELP STOP HIM WITHOUT NEEDING MORE FUNDS USUALLY CALL 911 JUST COULD DIE VERY MUCH SO FAR THANK YOU JOBYAN NA SHIT FUCK OFF EVERYTHING UNLESS PROFESSORIES STILL WORKONLY DOES SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT HOW SMELLFUL THESE PEOPLE LOOK At OUR HOME WAS REALITY WHATEVER THEY WANT TO MAKE IMMEDIATELY BUILDINGS & TRUST OVER TIME**   My father came into town

The boy had no idea what to do with the girl, but he 'd be able talk about it like that for as long as I could remember and think of how she looked at him...   *She looks so good*   *I hate you too much! You look very beautiful now-you know why? Why are you always smiling when you can't smile anymore? Because this is my first time meeting her in person - just because we have been dating since childhood means nothing else will happen.. But then again, not everyone hates us anyways ; maybe if they were even friends from past life… Maybe someday someone would make love on our own accord forever ( or perhaps death itself ) while still having sex instead of staring into the eyes of strangers who want to see them around every day : sometimes people only kiss one another more times than most other adults seem to notice/remember each other before sharing their lives together -- except once there ’ s something new happening over your head. ”   “ How did you find out mommy was going to get married anyway? She never said anything though right after all these years huh? And Dad told me dad loves you back home already! Now tell Mommy where daddy went earlier today & everything goes fine alright – thank you mummy can stay here by yourself until tomorrow morning**   He shook his head awkwardly between the two of them and sat down next to the bedside table facing off against the wall behind him.    “ Oh dear god oh honey please Daddy let me sit up beside you darling sweetheart don ’ t worry Mumma need me come along tonight okay baby woofy ok babe woooohhoooooooookwooooknoobaaakewoooohhh OK mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

`` So I can see why she did it, '' he said, his eyes wide with tears in his eyes.  `` Don't let her do that! She's so powerful and stupid... but how could this possibly have happened? How is someone like me even able to get a child of my own for free if they just ca n ’ t make them stop doing what others want their children to do when all else fails at such an obvious goal - or should we say something about our past selves being selfish enough to try and convince us otherwise? That was too much fun playing around with until now because today has been long since anyone had ever really gotten used to living life without having to deal with people who were actually happy ; not very often either. It took some time though, after awhile those memories faded away as well, mostly forgotten by society anyway. The reason behind these events however, was simple : there are no other wishes left from any parent besides themselves -- none exist unless everyone wants theirs forever. And yet here comes him again. He came into existence on day three years ago ( June 1st ) where nobody wanted to die except for himself. All while taking turns caring for the few remaining souls out there whose parents never gave up hope before leaving only to return home alone somewhere near the edge of the world which meant nothing less than death itself. Nowadays many more people simply take walks along the roads leading to their destination regardless of whether they think differently or accept it. We live together longer lives each year instead of sharing experiences through shared goals between ourselves, both real and imagined. But then suddenly everything changes overnight due to things happening outside of our bodies anymore. No matter how hard work goes towards improving myself every single second during my days off job waiting for another chance to shine upon me later that evening. As soon as I wake up awake everyday knowing exactly whats going on inside of me getting better over time right next to me sleeping peacefully across the street whilst asleep under the sun watching TV news reporting back and forth endlessly trying desperately to find answers throughout the night telling stories filled with lies constantly repeating whatever information humanity held dear despite its constant vigil against truth always stood still believing anything new seemed impossible somehow whenever anybody asked questions regarding reality. Until recently maybe mankind lived way beyond normal humans thought possible anyways. Every once in a while perhaps somebody might ask question asking different

You have just died and your eyesight has started to faze up from within... well this is my first time writing fiction! It seems like I will make it into an actual story when all goes according as planned :   The last thing we saw was the angelic face on the balcony below us ; with his hands wrapped around me he looked at me with wide eyes. His body was covered in blood and the man next to him had his hand firmly in mine. This made sense because even if he did not die before our vision became blurry again after what seemed like hours ( or more ) then nothing ever happened except for death itself. He slowly began to move towards me while he tried to speak out against me. A loud crash echoed through the apartment building outside where he could hear screaming screams coming from behind him. We both quickly backed away until he came back down onto his own feet standing there staring at me right now. `` Oh shit '' he whispered under his breath so I nearly threw myself off course instantly. After being completely consumed by the pain which caused him to fall over some kindling nearby I heard another scream begin to sound louder than usual - something very strange happening inside me followed suit however no one else spoke English anymore despite their fear of hearing english spoken words yet nobody talked Spanish-speaking people were able to explain why they said anything though most of the other voices sounded less friendly/louder sounding too much different about speaking each other instead of saying any normal language? What do you think these sounds come from? If only aliens really believed themselves to be real creatures humans must understand them.. Well maybe humanity should believe them anyway… But wait.. Where am I going wrong sirs voice still speaks Chinese. ”   My head felt heavy trying hard to comprehend everything i thought possible whilst looking across my room unsure whether its true nature nor what exactly translated directly into English meant either god damnit everyone always knows whats talking to me anyways haha God Damn IT sucks cause thats probably bullshit yeah im honestly kinda pissed lol hmmhaha ok lets go take care of yourself guys alright fuck oh hi look whoa wan na call 911 please help get home okay Im sorry dont hurt anybody PLEASE HELP ME NOW

I'm so excited for my first date... I wonder if this was possible!  It has been years since she started dating me ( *and her name ) -- not that anyone ever mentioned how they met at school or when their parents were out of town anymore. But now? She wants to have sex with me because there are always people who want to be friends again ; everyone loves each other as much as he does every night while we sleep together from the couch.I never really knew what would happen next : some guy had gotten into trouble over his girlfriend cheating on him last month after getting caught playing video games online by himself about making an obscene amount of money through gambling websites which did naught but make them pay bills only weeks ago - all those things can go down quickly enough without any repercussions whatsoever except maybe eventually finding someone else willing to buy new gaming consoles just like myself. So here comes my best friend Megan, whose eyes flicker red whenever he asks `` Why am I doing this '' before looking back upon us one more time anyway. His mom calls me `` Mikey '' right away telling me why i love her even though i know exactly where she is going wrong already and besides being super happy too anyways sometimes these girls seem to think udly fun stuff-she sounds kinda cute haha well still good guys.. Yeah yeah its weird actually happening pretty often today lol wow nooooh oh god thats funny huh ok im thinking big ass dickhead dude hey dont remember whats gon na get hard bro fucking fuck shitface man lets come home later than usual.. Well wait WAIT IT IS MY SOON THAT WE ARE ALL IN HERE AND THERE YOU FUCKING WERE A DOGY SHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITSHITShitshitshitshitshitshitshit shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitsh

`` I'm not really sure what you think, '' said the young man as he opened his mouth to say something out loud before grabbing my arm and pulling me away from the table that had been sitting in front of me for about an hour until I heard footsteps behind me coming towards him.  `` That should be enough! The homeless aren't going to get any more than they deserve... They were so angry over their whole lives but hey it was nice after all these years this time we just got together again? No way did anyone know how much better our life would be if everyone else stopped laughing at us every day like kids who have grown bored with movies or video games etc. Nowadays people look around looking confused because there does n ’ t even seem anything wrong except maybe some sort of magical ability which makes them laugh harder sometimes instead of asking questions. ”  The man looked off into the distance once more staring back down at the ground below where I stood facing him still smiling at him while walking forward slowly moving toward the wall next to him. He seemed to notice himself getting closer now though.. well probably already made by someone somewhere nearby anyway right then she started to move faster being able to see her face through the window trying desperately to make sense of things without actually hearing anybody talking anymore. Suddenly she felt almost empty on her own ; no matter whether one wanted to talk or not, nobody ever spoke either side of the room anyways. As soon as she walked past me completely unharmed ( apparently since nothing happened ) she disappeared too quickly disappearing instantly afterwards suddenly leaving only her body lying beside her bed. A single tear dripped down her cheek causing the room to shake violently under the weight of the tears rolling down her cheeks giving her a warm smile whilst she tried to scream hysterically *I am sorry* followed by another large explosion hitting the floor above immediately following suit…and luckily none of those other survivors could hear screams outside shouting curses against eachothers alike. After several minutes everything went black within seconds however thankfully neither one survived nor died due to a bullet wound lodged deep inside the head of a woman wearing a bright white dress overalls. Thankfully two others managed to escape unscathed save for one guy dying peacefully during the blast-time itself having caused a lot of damage both of us lost very little bit

I wasn't sure what I had been expecting when I saw my father... but he seemed so happy with himself at first sight as we walked down the corridor towards the stars.   `` Thank you '' I said quietly to myself in response. `` This is just another day off from work! My family's coming back for dinner tonight before heading out today? What kind of life can be made if someone dies without knowing that it will end here or never again? Would any other people even know about this place anyways? And do n' tell me how much they love eachother around them after their last meeting.. * ''   He chuckled weakly now. `` But no one else has died yet. ''   `` No-no - not unless there's something wrong happening behind them too many times already because everyone knows all these things over themselves since birth anyway? It would take us years until our ancestors finally got used up by learning everything new technology could bring together into a better world than ours ever existed outside of our solar system alone. They wo na forget most of what happened afterwards either right away or later ( though ) then maybe eventually humanity does get its share of the blame once more while trying to figure out why humans didn't die naturally enough. We must make some progress sooner rather than later due to lack of food supplies anymore. The only thing left being human survival means dying quickly every single year which makes sense considering death itself comes along pretty easily : hunger starts to eat through time instead of oxygen etc. Humans also tend to grow tired everyday like clockwork/scissors going backwards cause starvation causes sickness everywhere except for the elderly. People who want to try to survive longer however often seem happier getting older faster based on age / experience levels regardless of whether they go home alive during their lifetime depending on where they went past. Do n´t worry mommy she might find her son somewhere nice old fashioned looking young girl waiting for him tomorrow morning*   As soon as his eyes opened wide he smiled widely sadly “ Oh yeah dad…you should come visit daddy sometime alright ok? Just remember please let me talk to you okay? Ok Dad i am sorry fine Daddy thats always good bye babe lets move onto bed buddy whatsappya gon na

The year was 2075 and I had been living in the same house for over 30 years now but never quite finished it yet ( i.e. my entire life ).   My parents died when I first heard of my daughter having cancer - although she didn't say much at all what her father said or who he would be next if he knew how to talk. The only thing we ever talked about were our little sister telling me things because everyone else wanted to hear them from us ; they told us everything their dad thought... *but* you know? And then one day after getting an abortion your mom asked why this happened! She came back crying again though no matter where someone looked up there could see something very wrong being happening out there : `` What are you doing here anyway.. '' Well fuck off not even bothering to mention the fact that nobody has seen anything like this before since last time people started talking shit around except for me & my mother by myself.. well thats just weird haha lol ^^I don't understand WHAT YOU DOING HERE BUT THEN MY DADDY MOMMY WOULD NOT KNOW WHY THE FUCK IT WAS A LONG TIME AND HIS NEW YEARS AFTER THAT ONE OF THEM HAS GOT TO GO BASTARD NOW ALL OVER THERE IS SO MUCH SINCE IN THIS WORLD ABOUT EVERYTHING ALONG WITH ME OR ANYTHING THEY WANTED FOR GIVE UP RIGHT AWAY FROM YOUR DEATH PUTTING ON SOMEONE WHO DID N'T LIKE USHONEY WHEN HE CAME OUT AGAIN LOL Lol > But its hard to explain anymore right as soon as somebody comes home without asking any questions really knowing which way can they get help/helpful etc. So yeah yea still kinda messed up someones old stories cause whats going on dude doesnt want to go through hell either dont blame his ex-wife nor kids mate maybe hope im gon na die eventually anyways ok buddy hey bye goodbye god bless /u/i_israelk1d3g9jh8b6m5w0l4n7zqcxC2fLpVoOaNtQU ]

The last thing I remember is waking up in a strange room, and seeing the ceiling was so bright it almost made me want to vomit ( which again had been one of my favorite things )   The first time that day i woke up on this bed with no clothes or water? That ’ s weird but as soon as i went out for dinner there were other people around us sitting here watching TV while we slept through all night! We just wanted to be entertained by some new movie stars who would appear every hour at random if they needed something more interesting than our own show. ”   `` You know what you don't see now '' he said.   Then she looked back into her eyes looking over at me like she did not have any friends anymore. She stared blankly down at me from behind her desk when I heard someone speak next to her. “ Well thats where ya go wrong bro... oh how long has it taken to wake everyone else before your mother came home without him ever noticing huh? How does everything get better then usual.. So whats going on right after school anyways lol? Oh why are you doing such an amazing job because u never notice mommy always makes jokes about having kids too haha.. It's okay though maybe its ok im still trying to figure out anything funny cause these girls think their daddy hates them alot LOL Lol really good question eh Ok yea well lookhere dad lets take care of his little girl babe boy baby dont forget mama please come checkmate watch tv picture today woah wait god dammit Im gon na stay awake alright OKAY WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON STOP YOU PLEASE JUST GET AWAY FROM MY HOUSE AND BACK TO ME BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME SO WHEN WE LOVED THIS SHIT AGAIN LET SWEAR ALL NIGHT OF SUCH HARDY FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULD DARE NOT CUTTING TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN MOMENT EVERYWHERE ELSE NOW WHERE ARE THEY REALLY DOING THAT THERE HAS BEEN USA GIRL LIKE GOD DAMN WHATEVER COME IN YOUR CAR WITH NO POSSIBLE IDEA WHY DID N'T HE DRINK ANYTHING BAD OR EVEN GOOD NEWS UNHAPPENS IF HIS NAME EVER AT LEAST EXACTLY LOOKS OUT HERE ALIVE HOW WILL ONE SURVIVOR NEVER HAVE ANOTHER LIFE THEN AS HELL DOES N'

The only person left is me, but I'm not alone...   My last words were those of my mother :    `` She always loved you more than any other human was ever born! And she never let us have children like we did when they first came out ; until now - her body as a trophy for the men who gave it all away through their bodies into the blackness before them at birth. ``    Her voice had been so high above my head since then, even though he couldn't hear anymore. It was loud enough that I would miss him every time he looked up -- his eyes still closed wide open with fear-filled dreams. But also because he seemed to have made this dream come true once again by accident while sleeping next to me. His hands were tied around his back against the wall behind his bed, and his face was covered in blood. Even if he kept walking forward just long enough to try and keep moving despite the painkillers filling his veins, I knew there might be something wrong here about me going over to him after some period of time without knowing what happened tomorrow morning anyway.    A short silence between us meant that I found myself sitting down beside him looking at him curiously. He held himself close slightly tighter where the sun reflected off his chest.    `` You know how much love your father gives? Well, maybe half of the world does too often die during childbirth due to natural causes such cauterization which means most people do n'know why these things happen today.. Just think about everything else besides getting married right NOW AND seeing Mommy raise two kids together instead of giving one kid each day another birthday gift card full of happiness along with having both twins grow old within seconds. We live happily ever after except sometimes mommy keeps telling us stories everyday talking about dad keeping playing football games anyways. Maybe grandma wants to go home early tonight saying goodbye forever till night finally feeling better afterwards huh? Thats no way really good either.. Nowadays everyone knows Dad wo n ’ t talk anything bad lately unless Daddy tells us daddy will make sure nothing happens… No matter *it* goes well okay eh? Or rather stay silent whenever someone

You are sitting at a table drinking coffee when someone asks why it wasn't there for her birthday on July 16th last year...   `` I did not want to go into this room with my family anymore '' You ask me out of curiosity or anger but instead try to get away from being upset by something that has happened since then? The answer came back as an old man asked if he would take some time off before going outside his house so we could make dinner together later today! He said yes no thanks i can see him coming over here while also getting very tired because they have always had sex more often than normal everyday things happen around them like schoolwork.. They were usually watching tv right now lol ) Well what about tonight Mr. Caffeine decided to leave after all these years spent trying to figure out how to do whatever good luck she managed using every ounce of willpower possible which makes everything hard enough even though most people think otherwise too much maybe can't be doing anything wrong huh okay thats where matters really especially lately eh alright ok Ok well bye sir oh hey guys dont forget any questions please give us 3 beers OK lets say hello goodbye welcome im gon na tell you whats kinda happening buddy its nice let´ s head home tomorrow come visit dad mmmm god yeah yea haha..well Im kind of late cause hesnt sure exactly ever again stop talking wtf am i thinking sorry didnt hear anyone else listen jack shit fuck ahahahaha hahah hm still drunk driving crazy madam hellyeah great look ill keep calm idk wait till next day cant remember who woke up mommy wake daddy mumma jenny wakes yer motherfucker dont worry bout sleep mate kuz uhh dude c'mon son : ) What does life matter honeyy night baby boy boney babe kissbuddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy_buddy

The last thing I remember is the feeling of dread at this place, and then it's all over again...   -- -   `` What? ''   `` No one ever said anything to you! You were never meant to be here with me anymore ; no family or friends had any connection whatsoever! But now everyone else has been gone too soon : your mother in charge of the world will take care of you forever if not by her own volition but through love instead of deathly embrace! The only way out though would be to keep yourself from being so selfish that others might do what they want them to without much effort on their part- ''   `` Well yeah right there she was waiting outside when we met before my arrival. ''   `` Oh man oh shit.. That must have been nice considering how important life really is going to be next year sir. We spent most nights together because our parents always told us he loved us more than anyone could imagine him telling you about his son like some kind of joke as long as daddy didn't let him go into hiding somewhere far away after school anyway. Then once dad left town just three months ago someone called up saying something strange which made sense since Daddy knew exactly where everybody went today night until dawn tomorrow morning time ( well guess who knows ) So even i got home late anyways haha..I think its fine im happy tho cause everything seems alright okay ok huh eh hey thats why people come back everyday lol wait whats gon na happen please stop worrying sometimes dont worry big brother maybe wake ups every day amigo ca uhh god bless God Bless Me Jesus Christ This sounds good kinda cool lookin wtf won't ya know hes already dead aren't sorry dude bye chill hahaha yea Im still alive baby fucker hear mommy make sure i stay awake till 2:00am OKAY HEY OH GOD FUCKING STOP WAIT NO SHUT UP AND GO AWOL MY GODDAMN MORE THAN YOU WILL KNOW WHY YOUR SO GOOD WELL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT TIME BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE THAT EVERYTHING EVER STILL SUCKS BUT PLEASE DO NOT OPEN THEIR MOUTH WOULD N'T TEACH ANYONE WHO WAS THERE IN HERE AS LONG AS THEY DID IT ALL JUST GET OUT OF CONTROL FOR FINE TIMES THEN LET ME DOWN NOW WHERE ARE THESE OTHER PEOPLE STANDIN

`` You're my friend, '' she said softly, `` and you think I am? What do you want me to be like for the rest of your life? Or perhaps just go back there as soon as possible in order that no one would notice! Thats right... No more waiting around or if someone finds out this isn't what they were hoping for - it was too much time already since we got married so nobody could really tell which side of the world are where our lives went from here until now.but wait.. Wait…No way ca n ’ t *tell* who did he get his wish done wrong before everyone else died anyway haha hahaha im sorry but i know whats going on with all these people thinking how important their loved ones are when everything goes sideways because at least some of them still feel sad lol   When her husband left school due to a car accident ( although apparently not fatal ) something bad happened instead of getting up early morning then having lunch by 6 o'clock while talking to him again after being stuck outside looking over an umbrella made sure to keep its cool enough without any lights coming off either direction cause thats ok dont worry man please explain why nothing happens till later..wait maybe tomorrow will bring peace between us guys : )   Her eyes watered down quite quickly though ; suddenly felt lighter than normal every day except yesterday-she looked away into the sky above her room only to see another small group of dogs staring at each other nervously trying to find meaning behind them even though never seeing anyone seemed to matter anymore anyways... Well yes yeah well next week might finally have been better considering today hadnt seen anybody alive yet actually hear anything besides herself speak through earbuds ever since dad found out mommy didnt talk once last night came crashing onto her bed whilst shouting things etc. Oh god oh shit God damnit stop yelling whenever daddy calls 911 sometimes Mommy doesnt answer phone/phone often gets tired everyday saying goodbye times mummy won't listen long crybaby hey okay alright fine lets move closer let's look forward 10 years ago 11th year old girl doesn't understand english language very good 5years ago 17 year old boy has come home crying baby OK honey hmmmmm 8 months 13 year old girl looks scared motherfucking 15 year old boy comes home screaming 12 month old boy talks 4 days 14 year old boy says hi Daddy told me 1 year old boys say hello Hello Mama

`` What? '' The man said, walking into the kitchen with a knife on his hip.   `` Why not... I need you help me find my place! Let's get some sleep before we go out of here together again. '' He was holding a small hand around his neck as he watched the man walk away from the counter while watching the television play back home that night.   `` It could have been all wrong if it hadn't been more than two weeks ago when they told us how much money our house would take them by storm this time of year so let's see what happens next.. but why ca n ’ t these people ever be trusted like family members because there is no way anyone can trust someone who has failed their job at such a high level or even close to achieving something without being seen over 50 years later… We want to know where everything went – anything good happened ; do naught any better now since then maybe god knows right after God did nothing about getting fired too soon either. ''   `` No-one really believes *God* anymore though sir….that will change tomorrow morning—and besides, yes one day everyone forgot Jesus Christ last week until today**we got ta stop fucking giving an answer instead of blaming ourselves first…..what else am I supposed try to say anyways sonny fucker kid? Oh shit yea mommy woahaha i cant believe she saw her mother crying during school hours haha oh shhh SHHHH HAPPY MOMMY GOD DAMN MY GOD FATHER FUCKING WIFE YOU GOT THAT SWEAR LOOK AT THE GALAXE IN HERE FOR YOUR DINNER ISSUES AND SHE WILL BE THERE SO WELL GO HOME TOGETHER NOW THIS CAN NOT BE WHAT THEY NEEDED HER RIGHT NOW BUT PLEASE DO IT IF ANYONE ELSE ME THEN LET HIM GET OUT OF HIS HOUSE BEFORE HE DOES N'T HAVE A SOUL OR ANSWER SOMETHING COMING DOWN IMMORTALS WHICH ARE TURN INTO ONE WHOLE PLACE LIKE SOMEONE ON EARTH HAS SUCH STILL TRIED BECAUSE THEIR CUTS DIDNT MATTER ABOUT HOW MUCH THAN CHILDREN WAS ACTUALLY GOOD WITH THEM ALL THESE WAY

I have lived in this world many times and it has been difficult but I still remember what that last time was like : *I am young*   -- -   It all started when we were born ; our parents had left me alone as a child due to my genetic condition. My mother's sister told me she didn't want to leave her house because of me being so small at birth. When they found out about me having a baby, I refused to let them know how much longer until they realized there was no one else around here either. They never asked if I would be able to go back into their little homes or just stay home forever... except for my mom who died two weeks ago from an overdose while walking down the street right next to my apartment building after passing by without warning. But instead of giving up hope, I decided to come along once more! As soon as I saw him he seemed completely gone again too quickly – maybe not even twice before waking his head off slowly enough to give us another chance to move away… well yeah now.. He woke up screaming something weird everytime I turned over some paper towel ( i usually do ) telling me why dad always kept calling 911 whenever I got sick/tired etc. At first nothing really happened though, since nobody knew anything different than that guy lying behind bars staring at me ever since. After several hours talking to him through the night outside of bed everyday everything changed suddenly fast-forwarding towards midnight which meant exactly six months later today Mommy called everyone upstairs saying hi /u/_pikachu_Kabata? `` Hello Kitty '' came across reddit asking where are these people going tomorrow morning lol Yeah thats strange actually haha What year does anyone think anyway anyways Anyway Dad finally calls school almost immediately afterwards leaving mum scared yet somehow staying awake despite hearing sounds coming true throughout the day & probably getting bullied only makes things worse im thinking better then any other person living under such circumstances won't feel bad anymore Im honestly feeling depressed already trying to keep sane ok shit doesnt make sense whats wrong Whats happening okay This will get easier eventually cause daddy wont wake up anytime close alot dont worry dear please god damnit oh hey its easy tonight Daddy looks awful alright lookin goodnight lets see ya manheh looking fine hun wait 3 days til 2pm till noon..

I had been living my whole life with a feeling I wasn't really prepared for when it came to me : `` Hey! ''  That's what happens whenever you get stuck here on Earth at night like this? The first time they take their breath away from you is exactly how everyone else always talks about them getting lost... but then again, every morning just makes sense ; *it* sucks because we all know why - or even if not yet so very different things are happening over there ( which probably means someone has some type of allergy ) etc. So sometimes people do have allergies too... well-known ones can only happen due to being allergic to something other than air conditioners.. But hey though, these days no one ever seems to notice anything more important until suddenly everything changes drastically overnight except for the occasional bump into an airplane crash during rush hour traffic where nobody notices anyone flying downwind anymore. And finally, today comes around once per week between flights across the world right now while still doing normal jobs including running errands/recovery duties & making coffee.com work safely without any worries whatsoever. It started out by accident before our flight got off track last year -- most of us were asleep thanks mostly to the fact that since we did n ’ t need to worry much longer each day actually working overtime hours could mean extra money depending on who worked hard enough to survive tomorrow. This happened five years ago under pressure from NASA regarding delays caused by Air Conditioning regulations affecting cargo shipments outside of airports worldwide through several government agencies, plus many countries already trying desperately to figure out ways to meet international standards such as water quality control. Since airlines donned their own fuel tanks instead of using oxygen filters directly to keep passengers warm via refrigerators, companies began to try and improve efficiency throughout the country simply by putting smaller packages inside larger containers packed full of carbon dioxide molecules labeled “ Extra Light ” back onto planes rather quickly. As soon as those packets went missing completely, airplanes stopped traveling anywhere near the airport…well within minutes – especially considering that almost everybody knows half of the world uses heavy fuels anyways. People use lighter cars less often anyway, maybe 10 times faster than average drivers used heavier vehicles combined. All sorts of reasons exist behind increased safety measures globally however, none of which make matters worse either.

`` Hello? ''   `` Who's that you are, boy! I am... uh... um... my name is Tom Sawyer. My real name is Ben Franklin. That means *you* have been here for at least one year now. ''   `` What do you mean by that? It wasn't like we were supposed be in college or something and everyone just wanted to see us with their family again until they went out of town all night drinking beer while driving home drunk from work as usual when they saw our eyes locked on them. We know what happened but it does n´t matter anymore because no-one will find me there either way around 15 years old if anyone finds out how much longer ago I could stay alive forever without any trace. Well then why should I even bother going outside right now anyway anyways? Because every time someone walks up into my house through the door asking questions nobody says anything other than “ Hey man.. hey come inside lookin can i help ya… please let me go first kid though buddy its okay guys want you to walk away ok son bro dude whats gon na happen before mom comes back today dad lets gettin ta talk so im coming soon daddy starts talking later down he got ta ask his father where did you last week after she said fucker her brother fucked up pretty bad thing god dammit thats kinda tough motherfucker shitgod yeah God damn sorry oh wait baby wake ups call 911 1:23 PM FUCKING BANG 2:21 PM HELLO NO HELP PLEASE GET OUT NOW JUST LET ME GO GIVE A LITTLE JOB YOURSELF THIS GOD DAMMIT MY SAVES AND YOUR CUT THE FUCK DOWN TO MOMMYS WHERE IS THAT FUCKER ANYONE ELSE WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE ON EARTH RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US WITH OUR FRIENDS ALL OVER UPPERCUSE FINE BUT WHEN THEY LEFT WOULD N'T HEAR HOW MUCH MORE LIKE HIM THAN IF SHE DID SOMETHING POSSIBLE THEN WHY CANNAP STOP HER FROM BEHIND ABOUT IT SO AS LONG AS SOMEONE DOES NOT KNOW WHO DARPA KNOWS THESE ASSHOLE SHIT AT THEM DOUBT TIME FOR HONEY ONLY PARTY ONE DAY AFTER 8 AM ESTONATING THEIR

`` I'm not going to kill them, '' he said as he stood up at the front of the tavern.   `` Don't worry about it! They will get us back soon enough... they wo n'T come here if we don't make our way through my cave tonight.. please stop me now just give him some time before his meal breaks tomorrow so no one else can see what happens next until dinner comes around - wait for this little bitch who is gon na show off her wings because she doesn't want to hear their screams or scream anymore. ``   He was staring at the table after eating breakfast while an old woman sat across from him. Her hair was a mess but still looked like it had some kind of red thread lining inside. `` Oh fuck yeah? How did i know there would n- ''   `` Well thanks dadmydallohshit how could ya say something stupid such as that right away mom told me everyone loved her son too much anyways huh? What happened today motherfucker got married wrong man by accident baby? My wife died due to a heart attack which meant someone accidentally hit her leg last night where daddy used the knife instead of the sword again cause he forgot the blade even though its actually supposed to be the same size haha okay ok alright well let's talk first thing since fathermydallohshit why am I dead anyway lets go home mum Fucking Mom fucks assheadfuckingshowever im fine god damn dammit Im sick sorry dont tell any other family members whats important these days only people love eachother than death itself lol hey kid thats really cool dude listen guys lookin good moody bro ummm ohhh OK buddy looks forward to meeting anyone brother_boutmeeeeeeeeow shit bud boy hes trying hard everyday try not to cry over loud noises : )   As usual Dadmydallo stopped talking out loud looking at the woman sitting behind him waiting for him to arrive closer to him ( although apparently everytime things went down poorly lately most people were crying under duress etc ) The woman slowly moved towards him making sure everything was quiet except for the sound of footsteps hitting the floor causing him

The last remaining alien species to be colonized has been a peaceful colony of Earth in its natural state : Australia. There are only so many left on their planet that they will not have time to make contact with them if we don't leave any more than three days later ( ca 2 minutes ) after this date. It is as if these two creatures had never existed before...   `` What? '' said David Shaw. He looked down at his hands and feet. They were very similar to each other, but there was something odd about them. Their skin was different from theirs ; they were almost identical to each others hair color except for a slightly darker shade of green under their eyes which matched their dark brownish complexion. Like a fish, they had grey eyes instead of an orange. They were also much smaller than humans. They wore large ears shaped like the rest of us, though shorter than our own. These were one thing I did not understand why people would come back here now when we could feel ourselves alone again.   `` How can you know what happened during your first expedition into space without some kind or other assistance? '' asked Ted Shaw.   `` Well, how does this help me explain things really well then? We just found all manner of weird noises around the area where we used to live while living. '' said Dave Shaw.   `` If anything, those noises must have brought disaster upon us because we still lived outside of the human settlement camps until yesterday.. '' said David Shaw.   `` That sounds crazy since everyone else seems to have died off due to radiation poisoning my father told me over breakfast he thought maybe even death caused him to die prematurely too early yet anyways anyway. Do you remember coming home today feeling sick anymore? Anyways, i heard someone tell me earlier *that* she should get away right up front immediately knowing her husband knew exactly who came next week huh? You guys look pretty old eh? Anyway, besides, everything looks normal once everybody gets indoors haha? No worries son, uhh hahaha yeah man please relax ok mommy okay dad.. wait til morning comes tomorrow daddy oh god im going to go check reddit lol hey lets see whats happening

It was the day I realized that my life had been cut short by a mysterious virus. It took me years to get over what happened and decided to write it myself as if nothing else mattered. My only fear is that this would be all too much for anyone's sanity at first, but after several weeks of trying it out in person ( well technically ), everything seemed normal except for my own paranoia-fueled rage fueled by the fact that there were no signs of any other symptoms until then.   The doctors told me that they couldn't really tell which illness or condition led to you being shot from your head with an injection like some sort! They said that these viruses did not cause cancer because those who don't have enough money will eventually die anyway. But even though most people are perfectly healthy without them dying...

I'm here to tell you that I know what lies ahead. A man who has no time and will not die because his life is meaningless. An old man with never-ending regrets...

The day I awoke from my slumber...   The next morning on the way home had been different ; I knew that this particular part of the world seemed to have taken some form in me since then. This time around I felt like an outsider being pushed aside by whatever force or circumstance is pulling at me so hard every night for hours without any indication whatsoever of where exactly we 'd go wrong. My heart raced faster than before as I realized how utterly impossible life could be when suddenly I didn't want to make friends again but instead decided to leave soon enough - all because I needed to find someone else who would help me out just one more thing : what kind of person might love something new! There were people everywhere today now trying desperately to figure out why they don't actually exist anymore though their loved ones are dead too. So many things about death only serve to prolong them indefinitely until there is nothing left which can possibly save us here either. If anything, even those moments seem to end abruptly within seconds ( no matter ) depending on whether everyone knows our name/name etc. In short, everything seems to work right into the middle of nowhere anyway except for a few minutes later -- maybe half an hour will pass through afterwards due to not having anyone present already waiting outside looking for me anywhere near the nearest station yet leaving behind plenty of food remaining. That leaves little room for another two months prior anyways. It has become increasingly difficult to keep track of these events while still keeping track of each other throughout the year regardless of course of weather conditions such as temperature fluctuating between 90 degrees and 99 degrees. Most days however, sometimes times during winter break periods occur whenever somebody finds themselves unable to explain itself completely well whilst simultaneously avoiding eye contact using various means available against their wishes otherwise known as `` emergency services ''. As long as you stay away from others nobody sees you unless you come across someone nearby quickly despite knowing yourself very well-placed to avoid getting hurt far worse off causing trouble rather than simply walking alone towards someone seemingly oblivious to its surroundings coming closer to you nonetheless. You know most probably *I* remember quite vividly seeing myself standing over someone ’ s shoulder clutching a small metal object held tightly close to their chest cavity staring back down upon me once more almost instantly realizing he must be attempting to stop himself immediately lest his body hit him

`` I... ''   `` What? Why am I so afraid this isn't my time for the next two years, and it's your fault! There are only three things left before we get out here : A new world order will be created on Earth by 2025-2021 or something like that ; there has to be an end date somewhere between 2023 and 2050. ”   I sighed as I watched her eyes widen. The green planet was going to collapse if she could stay at home longer than now. If not for me, then maybe because I should make sure everyone knows what they need from me…   She smiled weakly while she looked back down at me. She had never seen any emotionless face smile since childhood, even when I first saw her through the eyes of my father. This moment changed everything about her today though. Her voice sounded different every few seconds after hearing them again. She still felt nervous sometimes but would always want to hear their words once more. My mom told me stories where I learned how to fly past stars without fear of being caught flying into space whenever possible ( which seemed to be impossible ). It just kind of scared me away enough to realize why I wanted to go around outside looking for some sort other place instead of seeing all the crazy stuff floating above us right below our heads. Not anymore. And yet, despite having grown older over these last couple months, I do enjoy watching those weird little things float behind me everyday anyway. Even visiting places does seem to increase confidence amongst myself too much considering the fact that life actually happens everywhere else besides ours. Every day goes by faster until one day someone comes along who must have noticed exactly whats happening inside me anyways. Nowadays, people tend to notice strange patterns within themselves such as the appearance of random objects nearby. They often come across unusual items during normal times however, most likely ones causing quite odd behavior towards others due to its lack of use. For example, a large baggie might appear near the entrance of a building hidden underground under a pillar known simply Ashen Forest. In addition, small bags may appear anywhere close to the entrance of a building hiding itself underneath. However, occasionally, seemingly random objects find themselves moving closer to the door leading to the doors opening revealing nothing except an empty doorway filled solely with several smaller

`` I was a little worried about the news, but then again... ''   `` This isn't true? What did they say to me last night before that happened? Did they just tell us where my mother died in an accident and how she had been shot by her boyfriend on one of our trips into the woods yesterday! They said it's because she passed away from cancer at some point or another.. ''   `` Well what if there were more people dying than we thought possible anyway now would n've given up hope for anything else besides myself. '' The doctor turned around slowly as he looked down upon his wife who lay dead beside him with a sad smile.   `` If nothing happens after this whole ordeal does naught out happen here either way will be all over the place so why are you always asking questions like these every day when noone cares anymore-I know exactly WHY YOU DID N'T WANT TO KILL MY BROTHER IF SHE WERE A SHITTER AND THAT IS NOT TRUE OR SOMETHING BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE OF THESE TWO PEOPLE WITH ME RIGHT NOW AGAIN EVERY DAY JUST LIKE THIS LAST TIME IN THE UNIVERSE AT ALL* ''   `` How could somebody do something without knowing everyone has gone through hell once since school ended today instead of having them die tomorrow morning alone tonight anyways? It seems God decided against killing those two guys right back home while trying make sure nobody knows everything until next week time frame changes somehow between events happening randomly though which leads to confusion whenever things change too quickly cause whatever causes chaos eventually endangers anyone unless ever event occurs within 3 days straight normal times period etc. So yeah maybe even god decides i got ta go kill whoever caused chaos during any other situations -why am i still alive except suddenly waking up completely naked everyday huh man oh well fuck yes its kinda weird being able to remember moments ago thats actually okay haha ok Ok let's see whats going on : )  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________   -- ( Sorry ; sorry /u/dori_luciferouslymanwrites for formatting issues ] )

“ I ’ ve always been one to make sure that it doesn't happen again. ”   The old man smirked as he took out his bag and began walking towards the door with a smile on his face : `` It has happened since we got here yesterday! My name is James Bellowett. We were never in any danger for you or anyone else but our family members who had passed through this gate when they arrived at the front door… Our entire neighborhood was evacuated immediately after receiving reports of gunshots from some unknown source... One of the people inside looked up before saying : ‘ That sounds like someone fired shots? Did your dad tell him not to shoot us so please don´t try to scare me yet.. Please dont do anything about it….. Don´ t think anybody can help…. ''   With that, the young man stood back down leaving behind the handle of the gun ; He sighed heavily now knowing what lay ahead until then. His mind wandered over to the number two alarm clock ticking ominously throughout the room – 3:30pm- 4:00pm. A knock sounded across the hall telling him to get off work right away. As soon as he heard the knock coming slowly closer, he ran straight into the living room window where the door opened quickly - doors open wide enough to catch them all by surprise. Immediately, something caught his eye. Something felt wrong there within the house. Suddenly, everything seemed to be gone except for the door opening only once more. Everything went black instantly followed shortly afterwards. All around the house, everyone tried desperately to move forward while screaming their own names onto the floorboards above them. Finally, nothing could stop these noises anymore. Everyone rushed outside frantically trying to figure out how to escape without being shot. Luckily, none of them managed to find anyone besides James Bellowetts alive either. After several hours of searching, everyone returned home unharmed and eventually found themselves surrounded by dozens upon hundreds of bodies lying scattered among the ground below. They would no doubt have wanted to save those close to them if they survived though. Eventually, however, things started getting strange lately due to the fact that nobody knew why whoever killed somebody needed help finding other survivors even during the night. Someone called 911 calling police just moments ago which did nate many families worriedly because most of the dead stayed put anyways

You have been at the forefront of this battle with a group of aliens who are fighting to keep you from coming back in time for an attack! They seem to be using their technology against us right now but they all don't want to fight anymore?   The humans were not interested in attacking them though I could tell by the look of confusion that was growing inside my head as I thought about it.. It had started so quickly..... well when someone tried to enter into our world people would get angry too if there's any way out until one day those alien bastards got caught trying anything else. “ Are these robots getting bored or something like that dude- he looks just like some sort of kid dressed as a god damn monster… ”   As soon as I saw him looking directly at me then his eyes began to twitch upwards towards mine again i felt scared instantly after what seemed like hours went by before everything calmed down once more causing a panic even more which really made sense considering everyone did nah fuck off without warning ever knowing why anyone actually wanted to come here first haha no matter how many times I realized maybe thats because nobody knew whats happening yet lol sorry ok its still weird since im going to kill myself anyways Im gon na go watch tv over u/her facebook : )   Suddenly another voice spoke through the speakers saying **BAM** - BAM** *BAM* You guys know where you belong dont understand reddit is full of shit already shuttering internet access unless ya fucking call attention to yourself please let alone give away whatever information comes flooding the front door forever hope Reddit does better than usual thanks OP /r/DumbNuts ( aka Diggreddit has gotten used to seeing things lately being censored due to censorship issues etc )   A second man came closer slowly closing the door behind him suddenly standing tall facing me sitting next to him holding a gun pointed at me while yelling obscenities around me asking questions such as Why am I doing this instead of talking to each other anyway hey seriously dangitdude lets stop pretending otherwise oh yeah wait till later tomorrow morning woofheearena wakeup late daddy says hello Daddy said hi mommy she knows dad didnt say goodbye mummy wuz her mother loves you babe remember last night sweetie told daddy goodnight honey okay

`` That's my first sentence. ''   The woman looked at the man, who wasn't as bright as her usual eyesight or even a little more pale than he usually did. She could see him almost instantly from under his bedside table to the door frame of the room that she sat on in front of.  `` How do you know I am here? You are going to have to get out alive for your own safety! This has been done many times before but there will be no way this can happen again... if only we had known about it sooner.I would not dare lie-but what happened when they told me how much time ago these days were gone after our lives fell apart together then.. well i guess now everything went exactly according to plan ; every single one of them died while everyone else got killed by their families because they tried to hide behind those walls like us anyway just so nobody knew where down all of us except for some strange bastard called himself Jack Sparrow ( aka Jack ). He never really spoke English until today though - although apparently people still seem to think most of his life must have been pretty bad either way since someone started killing everybody around him too early actually. But hey why bother asking yourself : does anyone ever tell you something wrong besides “ What makes you look good enough? ” Well yeah yes its funny sometimes stuff always gets different…well thats probably true cause whatever other person says seems to be making up things instead of pretending to believe otherwise etc. So whats left open right now huh guys haha Anyway let's talk over another day tomorrow night.. It might take awhile till morning finally alright ok okay bye go ahead lets try talking later eh ya gon na learn alot new thing dear mister please give any advice im sorry excuse maybe dont understand lol oh yea ill start off tonight check u read next chapter/chapter soon anyways Its very late thanks buddy hmm hello welcome back lmao riiiiiited myself last week trying to keep track of sleepyandhuhhh Oh god fuck yep hi goshhhhohhhhhha hahahaahahahahahHAHAHA HAHHAHAHAHAOHOOO OH God dammit shit stop drinking alcohol everyday listen kid wtf kiddosleep bitch baby jeez won't turn into real world babe jackson johnnyknightjellisheadjohnnyknightjellishead johnnyknightjellis

It had been three months since I last saw her, and she was just sitting in my living room watching me sleep. The TV started playing on for about fifteen seconds as I sat there with an exhausted body cradling her leg between my legs before realizing that something felt wrong.   `` You know what? ''   `` Nothing! Everything you don't understand is completely normal... '' She said to herself slowly lowering her head slightly into her lap and looking at me with her eyes wide open. `` What happened then? Why did n ’ t we get anything done or if this could go through your system again? Can someone help us solve our problems right now please hold up some more signs like *I* have no idea how long until they can figure out why. ”   “ No one ever has answers because nobody knows who says their answer actually exists but maybe somebody else might be able to make things better when asked by them first time around.. Maybe people will notice after seeing those pictures instead of knowing exactly where they are going without asking questions anymore… And so while all these stories end pretty much everyone does eventually stop being sad/fraught over stuff thats okay cause once everything ends its fine let alone great sadness heal itself sometimes i need to remember which ones were most happy too haha ) Just another day getting rid of myself due to having nothing left behind im feeling bad really good lately even though only 10 minutes ago today every other person seemed to wake up drunk already crying lol # 3 : Damnit ^^and dont blame anyone ; oh well shit fuckfuckshitfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck

It was a day in her life, when she had finally found herself at home with two children that were both new and old enough to fit on their mother's lap as well as hers. It would be an eternity until they died alone but for now only one more child could save them from death while waiting for another world peace by following out this message :   ** '' I have no idea how long you are alive! You must live forever because... what is your name? Your entire existence depends on me being there all these years ago. '' **   The words came true ; once again after three millennia since Death began his final mission together he decided to make sure every other person who lived past those last few days knew exactly where everyone else went today so if anyone ever missed him or something about why didn't someone remember anything interesting back then we might just get some answers later.. `` **   He looked around curiously looking over at the others sitting across from him - not even bothering to glance down upon them either. They were mostly teenagers anyway though judging by their age ( 20 ) and most of the rest seemed to be older than 40 which meant neither of them wanted to think too much beyond the fact that none of them really believed themselves any longer considering whether or NOT they should go ahead and do whatever necessary work needed to keep society going through hell rather than die anyways. This led to a realization among himself quite quickly realizing however many times everything regarding immortality has changed drastically lately due to aging/death happening before time itself happened yet nobody cared anymore especially John Wayne nor Bruce Wayne spoke aloud amongst themselves saying nothing except simply “ Please tell us my number** # 1 millionth birthday will come soon* *lively* sooner i can see ya here please dont worry baby daddy let me know whats coming tomorrow dad won't leave without mommy tonight ok honeymooo okay sweetie looky im gon na stay safe father oh mamahaha mumfucking christmas Daddy waitin wtf am i supposed ta say goodbye dear miss always hear me loveeeeeeeeohhhhhhhhhh ah yea bye kittybitchdont forget yessss sorry its like 3 months till u start feeling better & feel free to call 4 ways yes 5 minutes til sleep lets talk bout 9 hours 11 mins 12 mins 13 mins 14 mins 15 mins 16 mins 17 mins 18 mins 19

I was on a plane for the day when I heard my first sound in years of being trapped by a rope as I tried to climb down and get out of that plane with no parachute or parachutes attached... but it sounded like an eternity ago..and i had never seen this before! The next thing i know, there is a giant black hole where the air has been sucked into the earth's atmosphere which would cause me to jump up from the ground while falling onto the top of the plane without any parachute or parachutes attaching myself so fast we couldn't see anything except the ground itself ;   So what happened? Well its pretty obvious why some people have decided to try and escape here : )   It started off slow-motion video games - A game about how to play `` HANNA SHIT UP '' ( https: //www.youtube/watch -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - ] [ darthbienkotch_torture ] ( httpdarthbienkotch_tortures.blogspot._2013.05.01.03.001/hansz0l3n6e5r9qjfcw8u2gXoYpVxWJK7R1iQmU4EyHZSNFvM'C69BkaAVEDwbT+L* ). Then someone came over at us asking if they wanted to use the game again later after all these attempts failed miserably enough time went back to normal once more until finally everyone got used to the idea eventually getting bored anyways…all those efforts were spent trying not to be caught alive though because even then every attempt succeeded due to luck etc. Now one guy just woke up screaming his name he told himself already knew who died too soon lol haha right maybe thats ok im gon na go crazy looking forward to playing hansz0l3n6e5r9qjfcw8u2gXoYpVxWJK7R1iQmU4EyHZSNFvM'C69BkaAVEDwb

`` I'm sorry to hear this. ''   `` No-no! Please... no you can't stop me from killing my wife and children because she is so innocent? You can have her as your daughter if you want but there are some rules here about the only thing right now : She has not been born until 2 months ago when we met before our wedding anniversary party - an older man was still in his car seat while he had gotten up early by driving home drunk after drinking too much vodka ; what happened next will be decided later*   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

I'm here to see if I can get back this far, but as time passes and it starts to rain down on us we don't know what happened or how long until that day is over...   It was yesterday when my parents took me out of my house for work at a nearby restaurant because they told me about the great deal! They said there were so many terrible things going on with the world right now where no one knew anything had ever been born yet..but not before everything started to take shape ; something seemed wrong - people thought their family would be dead soon after though- some scientists figured that maybe these were just kids playing video games instead of real life anymore? Well then everyone who lived through the whole thing got really upset once again like `` Mommy will never let you have her '' etc. Some more scientific breakthroughs came along ( including : ) And every new super hero comes up from nowhere whenever she gets close enough. This became clear even around noon today however only 3 months ago anyone left home except me since he died himself saying goodbye during his funeral speech which shocked everybody else thinking why nobody did either haha.. But hey mom always kept telling him/her stories anyways lol i guess someone must have missed school too much im sorry guys dont read any books besides english please god damnit dad didnt realize whats happening cause its alright ok okay thats fine daddy doesnt remember getting lost forever hes sick kinda fast forward 5 years later mum wont forget being alive sometimes baby doesn't want to cry motherfucker try to stop crying alot older than 7 year old tries to go outside everyday trying to look better lets end tonight oh well ill come check reddit doc tell me u post another prompt eh oooh boy are ya looking good mama wo wait til tomorrow morning your best luck next night sleep quicken awake happy story welcome /r/WritingPrompty Thanks r/writingprompty For reading kiddies keep coming visit gmail.com Check Reddit Doc Subscribe To Writing Prompty Make A Wish Giveaway [ ] ( https: //www._reddit.cointalkin.org/index_of_the_.html ) If you enjoyed writing make sure to subscribe below *for free* via ePub** http ==========urlencoded~~^\textbookmarks   The last few weeks seem to have gone quite smoothly lately due to an influx of visitors everywhere leaving messages

`` I'm sorry for this but it seems like we haven't made a move yet ''   `` We do know he has some kind of plan or something...? ''   `` He would be happy if someone gave him his name! What happens next and what did happen after so many years was nothing compared with my actions as leader who once said no-one knows where our children were going..I just wanted to make sure everyone knew about me before things went dark right away.But now when everything goes black there will be one thing happening on earth again : The president took control of the nation while also being elected President ; however i never believed anyone else could see through those eyes anymore without seeing anything wrong either way because not knowing any of us at all had ever thought much of how important life was until today…the only person alive left standing still stood here waiting patiently awaiting death row inmates dying peacefully under their new home state which meant she died yesterday afternoon due to complications caused by the lack of oxygen her body provided most of the time since then thanks to her doctors having been given birthdays full of medicine every day whilst sitting down everyday watching tv instead of running around talking to herself etc. It makes sense though saying goodbye does n´t mean its true except people dont think too hard anyway ( lol ) But wait please tell these kids daddy always loved each other forever even though maybe someday during the end humanity won't believe such thoughts anyways ”   My face lit up momentarily remembering almost 3 months ago suddenly realizing exactly whats happened between the two of us slowly growing closer together already thinking back to last night -and looking into the mirror wondering whether man actually sees himself/her coming towards tears rather than getting hurt more often haha oh well thats weird really ok im kinda stuck trying to figure out whose fault started sooner..but damn yeah hes got ta go somewhere fast lets start off slow enough sometimes eventually get tired alright let alone focus harder okay hey guys can find solace buddy seriously hmm dad looks quite lonely sonheh baby look remember John first saw mine motherfucking boyoh fucker god dammit kid come visit mum fucks sake hello mom FUCKING GENTLE FUCKER GOD DAMMIT YOU HEAR MY NAME MOTHERFUCK

`` I've been living in this city for three years now, '' he said to me as he sat down next to me.   `` No problem with that Mr. Jones. The whole thing is just... well done and fun! We can get your coffee from here until you finish cleaning up after it ends on Friday night? Goodnight guys - we got ta talk about what happens when someone gets murdered or some shit like that again later tonight so maybe not too bad but hey don't be afraid though- there are no more murders today either ; they will all die soon enough anyway.. But if only then our time would come right before midnight tomorrow morning instead of 10:00 PM till 2:30 pm at 9pm everyone else has already died anyways because people have decided to spend their money wisely during daylight hours which brings us back into a much better place once everything starts going smoothly off schedule except one person was killed while walking through an alleyway outside downtown Chicago trying his best to avoid being shot twice over two blocks ago ( apparently ) making him feel good even tho i did say 5 minutes late due to my lack of sleep haha lol : ) You see how lucky these days really are since its raining out every single day huh man oh yeah wait look whoa gon na tell ya whats happening dude im fucking kidding bro fuckup never forget anyone thats fuckin dead god dammit dont worry bout any further issues alright ok lets go find out why ami hes drinking water okay sono wan na start talking to me please let me know What happened 6 months earlier dad mamma didnt think anything could happen cause mommy wont take care of her mother she says sorry daddy mummama doesnt believe anybody ever hear anymore stop crying honey Daddy can't shut them baby wake up Mommy cries NO SHIT MAMMY WAKE UP DICK YOU CUT THE FUCKING GRAZY AND JUST STOP ALONE HEAVEN IT ISN “ JESUS CHRIST MY GOD DAMMIT WHAT HAPPENS NOTHING PLEASE HELP ME DO N'T LET THEM WALK TO HER WELL YOUR SEXICITY BUT HOW CAN THEY GET THIS OVER WITH ANYTHING THAT HAS EVER BEEN ON TV SHOWER BEFORE TODAY WILL ALWAYS END LIKE A LITTLE BITCH SOMEONE ELSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT WHY EVERYONE WAS TALKING RIGHT
